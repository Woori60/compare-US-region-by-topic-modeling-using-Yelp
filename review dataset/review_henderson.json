I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone."}

Their Fried Wontons put everyone else to shame, though. Crab Rangoon also delicious, sometimes a little overdone but as far as affordable chinese food goes, I gladly drive the hike up Green Valley to their location by the 215 just for them even though Amlee is across the street (btw, Amlee- NEVER AGAIN).

Thank goodness because my grandparents and I just got done with a dreaded 2 hour dr appointment and was starving!

I order the chicken and Waffles and it was delicious! It came with 3 huge pieces of fried chicken with 4 pieces of waffles topped with what looked and tasted like strawberry butter. I should've took a picture but a picture was the last thing on my mind since it looked so yummy and I was starving lol.

My grandparents ordered the fried chicken sandwich and that too was huge and delicious!

If you get to choose your waiter, John was pleasant/funny and very attentive. He told us that our food might take longer than expected.

Highly recommend trying this place!"}

We're not so much for the fancy stuff. I very much appreciate Metro's decor, which harkens back to the original diners. enjoyed the chicken-fried steak and the hash. I wouldn't get the pot pie again, as they use rolled-out biscuit dough as crust. The best crust (and a flaky one) for pot pies is James Beard's recipe, which uses egg yolks as an enrichment. There will be plenty left over to take home. The waitpersons are trippy and very helpful. One day I asked for mashed potatoes....and they didn't have any...is that unforgivable for a diner? Stuck with fries again. I will definitely be trying their stuffing waffles sometime soon. We'll be getting a Metro Diner on Serene at Eastern (near WalMart and Home Depot), which will attract a lot of people down off the hill."}

Absolutely love their chow mein and sweet & sour chicken. Pro tip regarding sweet & sour chicken....most places give you the sauce on the side and refuse to mix it in the wok. I hate that. China Tango is more than happy to mix it in the wok so you're not left dipping when you get home. 

They give you so much food it's ridiculous. A 2 item combo is enough for two people plus left overs. Most Chinese restaurants (other than Panda) have a lunch menu then cut off all the combos for dinner time. Not China Tango. Their meal-deal is available all the time. Entree, side item (fried/white rice or chow mein), cup of soup, egg roll and crab rangoon. 

Another cool thing, when you order to go they give you your food in a box if it's a large order. Keeps it from sloshing all over the place on the drive home and is a really nice touch to keep things steady. Appreciate the extra effort that they give. 

Far and away my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area."}

Fried rice: The fried rice is dry or undercooked... I'm not sure which. It doesn't have much flavor and it's pretty bland. It's hard to eat due to the texture. 

General chicken:
You can tell the restaurant is trying to save money. Although the portions are large, the quality is not good. The chicken has a weird texture. It's dry inside and mushy on the outside. 

*The styrofoam container for the chicken melted and changed shape. They should invest in better quality containers that don't LEAK. 

*If you do decide to order from here, be sure to get enough napkins/ soy sauce/ forks because i received exactly ONE of each. For two people.

Service was good, maybe a little inexperienced but very nice.

Good thing we arrived early because by the time we left, people were lining up inside and out.

I'm not sure I'll be back for breakfast, but I will try their lunch / dinner menu. I was informed that they serve their entire menu breakfast/lunch/dinner all day.

No delivery at this time, but you can place an order and come pick it up."}

The little shop on Trop and Flamingo was set up like a drive in theater with a big(at the time)screen tv.
The waitress wore bright pink, dangling ball earrings and always greater everyone with a sweet voice and a smile.
Meals were delicious, affordable and ended with a piece of Bazooka!
Today the Metro empire has grown to all parts of the Valley. That's a good thing...yes, there is a but. As the company has grown the quality of the meals has dropped. The cost of a pizza is now ridiculous! 
I'm sad. We? the neighborhoods, have made you.

Monday morning around 9:30 i came in for the first time to try the diner out. Surprised with how cozy the atmosphere was and there was also a number of people inside. I decided to sit at the bar/counter and here's where it almost went bad. I sat there for a good 5/6 minutes and no one had came over for a drink order or said welcome or anything. Luckily the kitchen staff alerted the manager who was working to get orders out to tables that I needed my order taken. She IMMEDIATELY came over and apologized, asked what I wanted, and she said that it would be right out. She must've pushed my order ahead or something cause it came out in like 2 minutes. I ordered buttered white toast, eggs over easy (perfectly cooked), and biscuits and gravy. Food was really good, nothing that wow'd me but i ordered biscuits and gravy so that's expected. 

All in all. The metro diner is a cozy little diner with staff who have attention to detail and want to make sure you have a quality visit. They even held the door open for me on my way out. Hope that helps you out!!"}

My eggs were not over hard they were slimy on one side and my toast was dry as hell with no butter at all. I asked for butter and after waiting for quite awhile i got totally burnt toast. I asked again for new toast and as we were about to leave i got one piece of okay toast.

For $15, you get half of a chicken (drumstick, wing, thigh & breast) with 4 pieces of their popular Belgian Waffles.

We decided to just get a side order of their chicken since we wanted to get other breakfast items. My friend and I decided to just get 1 drumstick each. 
- They charged us $7 for the 2 small drumsticks.
- Holy crap, it was near inedible as it was a complete salt bomb. 
- My friend commented that they've been really inconsistent with their fried chicken lately. 
1st time: It was "delicious, the best fried chicken I've ever had." 
2nd time he had it, he said it was "super bland", so bland that he had to add salt to it himself. 
3rd time/yesterday: We damn near got high blood pressure. All you could taste was the salt.

BREAKFAST CROISSANT ($7): 
You can't go wrong with eggs, bacon and cheese. Very generous with the eggs and cheese, it was basically spilling over. What I didn't like was getting only 2 dinky slices of bacon. 

CRAB CAKE BENEDICT ($14):
Best dish of the day. The two crab cakes were meaty and tasted delicious, the hash brown was crispy and lightly seasoned. 

It took over 25 mins for us to get our food. The kitchen just couldn't keep up, you could see the servers all standing around by the window waiting to pick up their food. Our server was great in coming by frequently to update us on our orders, so an extra star for him and his friendly professional attitude. Metro Diner is lucky to have him."}

If you're used to eating Panda Express, this place is not for you, because it's Chinese food made my actual Chinese people. The chow mein noodles are so good compared to the nasty dry chow mein at other restaurants. I also love the sweet and sour pork! Order the sauce on the side though, because it might be a bit too much haha.

I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm feeling generous.  I gave the W. Trop. location 3 stars as well, but I actually liked that set-up and service there better.  

This location was very busy when we stopped by for dinner, so we sat at the counter to avoid the 45-60 minute wait.  Their counter seating is small and a little odd.  It's right next to the expediter, so we got a firsthand look at why they were so backed up.  He seemed truly lost and didn't want to listen to any of his servers who seemed to know more than he did.  I didn't like how rude he was to them.  The kitchen staff was very nice though.  They actually asked us a couple times what we had ordered because they could see how long we were waiting (over 35 minutes) for our food.

I ordered the Chicken Salad on a salad ($10.49).  It was filling, nothing special, but no complaints on flavor.  Everything was premade, so it should have taken less than 5 minutes to come out.

John got the Meatloaf Plate ($12.99 + $3.99) He asked if he could sub a garden salad for the potatoes and baguette.  The waitress said sure, but didn't mention that it would cost more.  It would have been nice to be told in advance that this was a $4 up charge.  Not a lot of money, but it's kind of crappy to add a charge without notice, especially since a garden salad is only 50 cents more than a side of mashed potatoes.  

Our waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of our visit.  I asked the hostess if we had one after about 10 minutes.  A server came over and took our order, but that's the last time we saw her.  We never got iced tea refills and the kitchen staff just handed us our plates over the counter (which we appreciated).  I had to ask the expediter for a copy of our bill so we could pay and leave.  Maybe we'll try again  in a couple months since the location is perfect for us."}

Our Grandson, Chase (an active Marine based in Camp Pendleton) and his girlfriend Denae had been at the Festival the night previous.  We had picked them up during the melee along with others on Tropicana Ave.  It had been a horrible night for all of us and we had stopped for a quick breakfast before going to the Lexus Hotel to recover belongings and for them to return home. We had previously dined here and loved it.  However, after dining on a super wonderful meal we asked our Server Patience for the check.  The onsite manager, Hanna, informed us their was not charge and they would take care of the check.  They thanked myself (a veteran) and my Grandson for our service and explained how sad they were for the events they had observed at the Festival.  What a wonderful gesture and pleasant surprise from a very concerned group of employees and employers.  I have in the past experienced wonderful service and food.  These people are incredibly gracious, attentive and professional.  It felt like family.  Just wish to thank them for their kindness and tell them they have a customer for life.  We plan to visit them often. They are exactly what a people business should be and they demonstrate great pride in our city and community.  We would recommend them to anyone interested in great food and service in Henderson.  Thank you all for being so wonderful, concerned and thankful. You are the best.

ordered the egg drop soup, eggplant and tofu, and ginger beef with green onion.  egg drop soup was unspectacular, not good and not bad... fortunately, the other 2 dishes were quite good, the eggplant was fresh and combined with the flavorful tofu, the dish was amazing.  next up was the ginger beef dish, i would have eaten it all had the portions been smaller, but that was definitely a plus.  big portions, simply said!!!

i will be returning to sample their other dishes... 4 stars simply because i think their AC wasnt working very well and it was quite warm inside the restaurant.

Especially notable was the friendly and enthusiastic service I received.  They really know how to make you feel welcome.  And the key is that it was genuine friendliness and enthusiasm; they weren't just going through the motions.  I had the avocado veggie wrap which includes fried jalapenos, carrots, spinach, avocado, sour cream, red onions, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ranch dressing.  It came with your choice of side; I had it with french fries that were cooked to my liking, not too crispy and not undercooked either.  The wrap was excellent! The diet coke I had was really good as well.  Sometimes fountain beverages don't have the proper fizz or don't taste right for some other reason, but this was one of the best diet coke's I've had!  

The only negative is for me is that I'm a vegetarian and they don't really have any lunch or dinner choices for the vegetarian other than the aforementioned wrap and a grilled cheese sandwich.  I suppose you could also get a spinach salad and either hold or substitute the bacon for something else.  Another option is to get the macaroni and cheese along with some other side dishes such as cole slaw, sauteed veggies, and fresh fruit.  But otherwise I really loved it and look forward to coming back!"}

I was honestly surprised to see the solid 4 star reviews when I yelped this place AFTER (yes, after) I had lunch here. I was quickly seated upon my arrival (yes, you get wait service when you aren't doing takeout) and asked for my drink order. Upon receiving my drink order I was given egg drop soup and fried wonton strips. I wish I could have been given a choice because I didn't touch either one and am still feeling guilt for wasting food! He took my order and before I could blink my food was at my table! 

So, A+ and bravo for the really great service and large and generous food portions.. But the taste was a no go for me. I am far from a picky eater, but I ended up just eating the fried rice from my meal. I got Kung Pao chicken, and it just wasn't right. The sauce just tasted like a... molten salt lick. No sweetness, a hint of tangy, a ton of salt. And when placing my order, the server warned me it would be spicy, maybe the salt killed the spice? And the texture of the chicken wasn't appealing for my mouth either. One of the reviewers commented on how they deep fry everything which can answer to the texture of the chicken.

I'm glad this is well liked by the community, and I understand why due to the speediness, heaping portions, and small cost, but next time I'll stick with what I know I like."}

I wanted something for brunch time that was close to the Galleria mall (my next destination). It was Saturday around 11am. There was ample parking in front and in the back of the building. There was a 20-25 min wait, but it ended up being less than that. There were many people on staff and everyone who helped us from taking our order to clearing plates was friendly and timely. The menu had a lot of options and I already have some ideas for when I come back! The food was delicious! We got the fruity waffle and breakfast burger for 10 and 14 dollars. And I will say, the food wasn't just good, it was a step up from your typical breakfast place. It was very good. Although I could have stood some more bacon on the burger. I also saw a lot of salad options going by and they all looked incredible. Overall very satisfied with the experience. 

Part 2: I came back the following weekend because my first experience was so good. I was expecting it to be another great experience, but this time it was out of this world! I'm blown away. We ordered chicken and waffles and the bold city burger. Let me tell you, best burger, ever (added avocado). Greatest chicken and waffles ever (tied with Hash House for best dish) except Metro Diner has STRAWBERRY BUTTER! The waffles at Metro are the lightest most amazing waffles ever and I found a piece of real strawberry in my strawberry butter! I can't even express how delicious this meal was (we half/half both dishes via plate swapping) Even the very last bite of the burger had ALL THE TOPPINGS on it. That never happens. John, our server was hilarious and attentive. Never missed a beat. And have I mentioned the music? Everything about this place is superb. Go there. Now!"}

The cheesy grits were an epic fail, I'm a grits gal, and they totally messed up my grits. Too watery, and had too much black pepper. It was not good. Our waiter then started to drift off and was no longer attentive to our needs, he had the label Trainer on the back of his shirt but seemed to be gossiping with his coworkers instead of actually training smh...you would think if the customer mentions the only reason why they came in was because they seen it on Drive Ins Diners and Dives, it should be clear indication they would be writing a review about their experience after the fact , so wouldn't you want to be on your Ps n Qs? Maybe its just me"}

Came here for a high carb/cheat meal. I had the biscuits and sausage gravy with two over medium eggs and home fried potatoes. Yuuuum! They were the best biscuits and gravy I had in a while. The biscuits were so crispy on the edges and soft on the inside (my fav) and the gravy had a good taste. Portions are very generous. I barely touched my potatoes, only had an egg, and maybe 2/4 of the biscuits. It was a lot and I was so stuffed. I was also able to try the strawberry butter (extra charge) with toast and butter and damn that was gooood. 

Large portions, cheap prices, good service.. what more can you ask for?"}

Prices on the various burgers vary from $9.99 to $12.99 and this is the general range for most of the breakfast lunch and dinner entrees (breakfast served any time).  The burgers are a half pound  and they are GOOD QUALITY MEAT.  They are not greasy messes (which causes the buns to become soggy).  They come with a wide assortment of sides from fries to mac and cheese to fresh fruit and several other items.  This is a far better burger than some of the big name burger joints on the strip that are twice as expensive.  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but I look forward to it!  Clean, friendly, excellent food, fast service, that's 5 stars in my book!"}

Had to try this location because i had been to the one on rainbow and forgot to review it....so I took my staff here for our monthly luncheon! We had employees that helped the contractor who was building this location so we wanted to come support them.
My 1st experience at the Rainbow location was good. The food was great but the atmosphere was a little less than I enjoyed. I know this is a diner but the person calling back the orders to the chefs was extremely loud and was very distracting from trying to have a conversation at my table.
I ordered the burger that was made with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and the burger in the middle. It was yummy. I have to say I am extremely picky when it comes to meat...this was good. Well seasoned. I like the lettuce slaw...mayo, lettuce and pickles...perfect idea. For me the only thing that could have made it better was if the crusts were cut off the grilled cheese sandwiches. It was a lot to try to wrap my mouth around and I was very disappointed in the mac N cheese. I thought at a diner it would have been amazing but it tasted like noodles with canned cheese on top. My man had the fried chicken plate. He said it was really good. Very tasty chicken and juicy.
At the Stephanie location , although it was brand new, a lot of employees with trainers, the feeling and vibe was SO much better. The noise was just the patrons enjoying themselves not a man yelling out orders.
Our waitress altough new was very pleasant and did a great job. Her trainer...omg...you guys need to promote him. I wish i remebered his name...he was from Rainbow he said and has only been with the company for 2 months. You would have thought he had been with you for 10 years.
My staff all ordered something completely different. 
Huevos rancheros with chocolate chip,banana pankcakes and the other was a burger with swiss,bacon and mushrooms. I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye! As I stated i am very picky about meat so I was a little hesitant to try the pastrami and I am SOOOO glad I did. It was the best I have ever had!  I will definitely be returning to the Stephanie location!!! I will let my photos speak for themselves!"}

I've visited on several occasions to try out the delicious menu.  Every meal has been wonderful.  The Charleston Shrimp & Grits is my favorite.  The roasted red pepper grit cakes are topped a delicious shrimp and sausage sauce.  It's a very generous dish with always leftovers to take home.  

The Metro Club is also a nicely done sandwich with the amount of meat and ingredients piled into it.  It's lightly toasted bread tries to hold together the mile high sandwich.  I opted to try the Mac & Cheese with the sandwich.  It's decadent and creamy.  I would absolutely order it again as a good side dish.

Well, he was right because it turned out to be the most delicious waffle breakfast I've had in a long time. They even served real maple syrup (not the fake stuff that claims it's real but is made in a factory.) The tea selection was on par with what you'd expect at an afternoon tea in Kensington.

First of all I have found they deliver a lot faster than the 45-60 minutes suggested on the app. We always order about $100 worth of food. There are 3 of us and it lasts a week for leftovers so that's part of the fun. The level of spicy flavor in foods like the pad Thai is fantastic. I love high spice levels and they do a great job. We have tried a huge variety of the menu and it all was delicious. The textures are all excellent and if the food should be crunchy, it's crunchy and if it's supposed to be tender, it is! The amount of food for the price is also excellent and if you order sweet and sour sauce laden items they give you a good sized tub which we like to drizzle over our rice as well. The delivery guy also brings our large order in a cardboard box so nothing spills. We also often get extra fortune cookies. When I moved to Nevada from California we were afraid we would not find a happy Chinese restaurant to order from, but we are highly satisfied. I can hardly wait for the next time we order!"}

That being said, I'm still not placing Tango in the top spot for neighborhood Chinese takeout joints. You'll have to see my other reviews for that. However, it is closing in on the competitors. Today's featured dish is the Garlic Shrimp, which gets an 8 out of 10. 
I've had this a few times and it never disappoints! I love mushrooms, and the funky alien looking shrooms in this dish are cool. And tasty.
Lots of veggies in this one too, and it's spicy (don't chomp on the small red peppers)
which I love.
Oh, and they have your order ready so fast you'll think they saw you coming and could read your mind...."}

So if you go, you may want to tell them to go lightly on the salt unless you really, really like salty food."}

Got a to-go order and placed it over the phone. I had ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta along with a side garden salad. Long story short, I got home and had high hopes for the pasta, but it unfortunately fell short. The cheese topping was definitely shredded/grated cheese (the same one that's on salads, I believe it was cheddar cheese). Also the food was already cold when I took it back which was disappointing! Overall I felt like I was eating one of those microwavable pasta dinners and was disappointed.

For the price (Paid around $14~, can't remember), I definitely expected better. I wish I could give a higher rating for this place since I've seen reviews complimenting their service and food, so I'm not sure if I just picked up an order on an off day."}

They're only open until 8 which is kind of a bummer but personally I feel like it's all worth while.  No grumpy workers, food is on point, clean environment.  That's a win win for me! Their deserts are made daily and constantly changes and so do the specials, I've never tried the specials but the desserts are super yummy! I think the reason I enjoyed this place so much was because it had a small town diner feel to it, and it was super nice to experience that right down the street.

We ate in so we were served. I had a lunch special so it was served in a plate lunch box (which I was fine w/ as usually I don't eat all my food in restaurants anyway. It would already be set to pack up & take hm if I didn't finish). Anyhow, I ordered fried rice, chow mein, sweet sour pork (which I'm so picky w/ because it's one of my fav Chinese dishes, & it also came w/ a soup. I believe it was miso soup but don't quote me on that. They also give a tray of what looked like wonton chips appetizers which you dip in sweet sour sauce. A bit too greasy but my little one loved it! =) All this for about $12 or so. I did buy a fountain drink of course. Not too bad for the amount of food we were served. Back to the sweet sour pork, absolutely delish! Not too hard & not too greasy. & most of all... Not super drenched in sweet sour sauce. I hate it when the crispy batter around the meat is soggy before I even get to eat it. This was perfect! Way better than what pandas serve anyway. Chow mein & fried rice was great as well. Tasteful. The guys working were super nice. The place was clean. No funky smells. Haha! Definitely gonna eat here again. Hopefully soon when i get the chance. This ones a keeper for me!"}

The food was disgusting, covered in a half coagulated brown gravy, and vegetables that were just thrown on the plate in disarray! Our server didn't know whether she was coming or going.
I'm sorry but we will NEVER return to this diner or any of the other metro diners in Vegas! Food tasted terrible!!!!!"}

I believe it's the owner's son who serves me every time, he is just a disaster. He never knows what to say or do, and if I ask for something to be taken out or substituted, the answer is always no, and they never listen to anything I ask for in terms of my food. I'll say, "no thank you, I do not want any soup today, its too hot outside..." He brings the soup anyway. I'll ask "can I have one egg roll on the side instead of soup?" He responds no. I'll ask if I can get half and half two different entrees in my to-go order, he responds no. Just not the type of kid you should have running a restaurant, its sad!"}

It's definitely not gourmet Chinese food by any means, it's a good place to fill you up on a budget. In addition, they have a good family meal option for a fair price, which is nice if you have kids (and you have several options for the dinner, and they are not stingy on the choices).

The chicken and broccoli, salt and pepper shrimp, the war wonton soup, and the orange chicken are very good. I especially like the crab rangoons, and the fried dumplings. If you are looking for a fast and friendly place for Chinese food, on a budget, look no further!"}

I had a fountain diet Coke ($1.50) which was refilled 3 times and my bill was $12.20.  The place was clean, I was waited on immediately and was impressed with the food and saw many orders to go that impressed me with the large portions they served.  I highly recommend this place and would have given it 5 stars if the people serving me had smiles on their faces.

We've had delivery on small or large orders & we always receive it right away. So basically your turn around time for delivery is not a long wait at all. 

Dining inside was actually pretty nice for a take out place. It's clean, they're just as friendly in person as they are on the phone & they always come by to make sure you have all you need including refilling your drinks.. I know of several restaurants that are bigger & your server disappears. 

Food is made to order, flavorful & nice portions! I recommend this place if you want to go out for a low key evening or if you need a night off of cooking, order family size items. Prices aren't bad at all either."}

I love those, but they have no clue how to prepare them.  It should be ham, turkey, swiss on bread that is egg dipped and deep fried then sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Side for added flavor is either maple syrup or a sweet jelly/jam such as strawberry.  Well,  they got the ham, turkey and cheese ok (but not much of it) and the bread was like almost a whole loaf!  It was deep fried but you though you were eating slightly flavored bread.  They provided some sort of a berry "dip" to spread but overall it couldn't hold a candle to New York Deli (that burned down 10 years ago) or the Pine Tree Restaurant of Spring Mountain that CLOSED two years ago.  Short version... there's no where in Southern Nevada that knows how to make a Monte Cristo.

Part two...my wife had the bar-b-que sandwich which was ok BUT...they provided their version of a bar-b-que sauce that was the color, consistency and FLAVOR of catsup with a little bit of pickle in it.  She ate the sandwich but the sauce was a waste of time.

Service was very good but that's all this place had going for it.  

Our one, and only, trip there."}

Over all, I will order again. I would say it's good step up from Panda Express. 

China Tango is not to be rated against a nice sit down authentic Chinese restaurant. 

PS: my order came with two containers of white rice free, I normally order brown rice if offered but I didn't see the option to choose, and honestly I didn't know I'd even be getting rice so no biggie. :) 

PSS: This place is FAR FAR FAR better than the Chinese delivery (I won't name names) in the Sprouts/Target center at Green Valley & Horizon Ridge."}

I had to salt pepper and add much hot sauce to give this any flavor at all. I'm going to give it at 3 because it wasn't bad it just wasn't good.

I'm not sure if this was the usual playlist, nor am I going to deduct stars, but it was definitely a surprise for my first visit.

In any event, this is a casual Chinese restaurant in the mold of China A Go Go. I ordered the Hong Kong style chow mein, which is my usual order when eating at a new Chinese restaurant. Food came out quickly and piping hot. They didn't skimp on the chicken, beef, or shrimp, which made it a good value. I don't live on this side of town, but it is close to the church I attend, so if I'm craving Chinese food on a Sunday afternoon after mass, I know where to go."}

First visit was during lunch with the coworkers - arrived 20 minutes before noon and was seated right away. I swear as soon as 12pm hit, it became super busy - all tables were filled!
The staff were very friendly and had bubbly personalities!
I ordered the 'Fried Chicken Plate', includes half a chicken - fried, mashed potatoes with gravy, grilled veggies and a biscuit. Dinner item for lunch, I know weird, but before ordering we kept seeing the chicken pass by and didn't want so much of the breakfast/lunch food, so that was the best bet. Definitely did not disappoint - chicken was super crispy and moist, mashed potatoes were buttery good, the grilled veggies were simple but nothing beats that grilled, charred taste, and those biscuits made from scratch daily, ughh *drool*! Also, had a side of onion rings. 

Second visit was during dinner with family, it was SUPER packed! Informed a 15-20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. Staff was still very friendly though!
I decided to try the 'Chicken and Waffles with the Strawberry Butter'.
I know I went opposite this time -- breakfast for dinner, lol!
Chicken this time around was a bit salty. The waffles were perfectly crisp and that strawberry butter is amazing! Such a unique concoction! 
Mom got the steak and eggs. TBH, we've had better - so this was just "ok" in our books. Stepdad got chicken fingers with fries. Brother got 'Bold City Burger', which has cheese, onions, bacon, sausage, jalapeños, lettuce, tomato on a brioche bun - this was soooo good!
ALOT to take in (literally) but the toasted bun with all the ingredients together takes this burger to the next level! A MUST TRY!

Very pleased with both visits and like I've mentioned before, I LOVE comfort type of foods! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}

I was happy to see that this location opened up because it is closer to me than the other two locations in town.

Overall, the food was good with the exception of the fish and chips which were HORRIBLE. Small, thin, sad little pieces of fish with a weird texture. And the tartar sauce was just glorified relish. I couldn't bring myself to finish the dish.

We were seated promptly upon entering, but after that, the service was pretty terrible. One guy noticed we had been waiting awhile and announced that he wasn't actually our server, but would get us drinks. Ruby was our server and only came by our table to take our order and to take the bill. The first guy and bus boy checked on us more than she did. Plus she left me with the IPad after I paid instead of waiting the five seconds to wait for me to just sign and be done with it. Felt weird to be left with such important equipment. I also waited a good portion of time for her to bring the receipt, but it wasn't until I got fed up and started to walk out that she scurried over to our table and handed my mother the receipt.

I will give them 2 stars because the rest of the staff was AMAZING! People got the door for us and even though this first guy wasn't our server, he went out of his way to help us out.

I know this diner is new and they are still probably trying to figure things out, but I feel disappointed considering it has rave reviews from everyone else. I feel jipped."}

I had asked as I often do for extra hot oil and other sauces and was so pleased to receive for the first time a nice selection and quantity of sauces including my favorite, hot oil.

No problem with that. My husband ordered the Cajun pasta in which he loved , really tasty. I ordered the meatloaf w/ mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were really good and freshly made. The meatloaf was spongy as if it had too much breading in it and salty. The service was different as many people came to our table. Overall good"}

Hubby had the special, a cheeseburger Benedict and said it was really really good. Kids had yogurt with berries and granola and the portions were huge. And finally a side of cheesy grits with butter that were amazing! All the kids said eer have to come here more often. Think this will be replacing black bear for us.

Metro is on their game with efficiently serving up good food. We've never had to wait long for a table and the food is quick to arrive at the table. The front of the restaurant has a comfortable waiting area for busy times. The servers have been friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant has an old school diner feel, but cleaner and more open.

I've enjoyed a Crab Cake Benedict and Sausage Gravy & Biscuits. Both were delicious and came out as generous portions. The hash browns on the side were tasty too. My orders have been correct and well prepared both times. Next time I'll have to try the signature Chicken & Waffles!"}

This is a typical fast food Chinese place, over salted meals and quick service, but  sometimes you just gotta succumb to the call of MSG. I actually thought this place was pretty good, although not something I would eat everyday. 

I sat and was immediately greeted with water and fried wonton shells and a sweetened dipping sauce. These were a nice little touch for a dine-in fast food place, especially since I was starving! I ordered the Crab Rangoon, which is a fried wonton with cream cheese and crab meat inside. These pretty much tasted like fried cream cheese and there was barely any crab meat inside. The little crab meat I did find I'm pretty sure was from a can. Not my favorite.

After I snacked on Crab Rangoon the main course arrived. Ma Po Tofu with Pork and I swapped out the rice for Chow Mein noodles. This dish was huge!  It had mounds of noodles and a full plate of spicy tofu and pork. This was a lot better than I thought it might be especially after the "Crab Rangooning" that happened moments earlier. The tofu was cooked prefect and melted in my mouth, pork was very flavorful, but I wish it was cut into bigger chunks instead of minced pieces. Still very good and very spicy! 

The Chow Mein substitute was a good call. These were a perfect compliment to the spicy tofu/pork plate. They were soft and seasoned perfectly, I could have eaten a plate of these noodles by themselves.  China Tango is great spot for a quick bite, but I wouldn't frequent it unless I wanted to go into a sodium induced coma."}

This place serves fresh food that isnt greasy or overly salty. The vegetables are still green and crunchy, not soggy and wilted. Meat is good quality. You know those weird, gooey, unidentifiable chicken pieces you sometimes get in Chinese food? None of that here. The flavors are spot on. My favorites include the moo goo chicken, singapore noodles, and shrimp with broccoli. Large portions that arent drowning in salty sauces. Yay!"}

I mean it was okay but not that great . In Utah there's a place called the Italian place that is a hundred times better and you can get a huge sandwich for $10 and share it and not have to tip a server. I got the pastrami sandwich that had an egg on it and cheese and coleslaw. I didn't realize that it had Fry's on it too. I'm sorry but it just wasn't very good .  The bread was not toasted at all. It was these big slices of bread with all this stuff on it so it was really hard to eat. The Fry's that were on the sandwich were squished soggy and cold. The egg on the sandwich was cold . It did lot of meat on it though, but it has this really strong flavor like it it's been brining forever. I didn't get any mustard for the pastrami and the waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted any. Who eats pastrami without mustard ? Then my husband realized that he's lost his wallet and we had to leave. The waitress brought us our containers to put our food in and then I went up front because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to wait for her to get my credit card. She finally came up there and ran my card then left me standing there with the paperwork that I had signed and I had to wait for someone to come back up there to get it. So I tipped her $1 less then I was going to. I mean if she is going to leave me standing there when she knew I had an emergency then tough luck your not getting much of a tip from me. Seriously people if Guy Fieri's going to endorse your restaurant and live up to it!"}

We were greeted promptly by our server who was super friendly and energetic. 

I settled on a breakfast burrito. When it came out I was overwhelmed by the size of it. As I dug in I quickly realized it was a classic example of quantity over quality. The burrito was covered with salsa which made it soggy on the bottom. I found that the egg whites inside were a little bland and needed salt. The burrito was filled with egg whites, green peppers, and black olives.

Hmm..mind you, it's barely 4pm and there is only one other occupied table in the restaurant! For 15 minutes, I watched our server bus empty tables and stand around looking into space.  There were also FOUR other servers standing around not doing anything with their side chit chat. Wow! I can understand the wait if it's busy, but this kind of service is unacceptable.  I have worked in customer service related industries for years and I have never walked out of a restaurant in my life! As we walked out, a sarcastic server said, "thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed your meal!" Let's just say I will NOT be coming here again."}

My husband teasingly jokes about us visiting diners all over the world, Henderson.NV to Paris.FR . Metro Diner, Henderson, NV -Stephanie Road will be added to my favorite list.

A friendly welcome relief of delicious food and drink, for a solo business traveler seeking comfort.  Plus a great slow atmosphere before speeding into the rest of your day.

Interior photos to be added later.
A very unassuming exterior, with delicious delightful food inside.  Similar to the warm and friendly feeling, I've always experienced in Southern USA. (Southern Cuisine)

Something for every palate: Organic choice teas, No-Carb option (egg & turkey sausage), crab egg hollandaise, to sinfully tasty looking waffles & pink ice cream. (didn't try-looked absolutely delicious).

Diner service from host/hostess, waitress, visiting regional manager, and the amazing COOK was phenomenal.  Just what the doctor ordered after the awful tasteless, and high priced Westin Lake Las Vegas.NV buffet breakfast the morning before.

A new customer for LIFE.  Can't wait to bring my husband here for good eats.

Much appreciation!  Metro Diner, Henderson.NV Stephanie Rd."}

I ordered take-out shrimp chop suey, which came with chow mein and fried rice. The total was about $7 bucks-ish. Remember, they don't give you condiments unless you ask, so don't forget! 

The shrimp chop suey was decent and flavorful. There were plenty of vegetables, which was delicious. The shrimp was bit tough, which was my only complaint for this dish. The chow mein noodles and fried rice were very bland. I wasn't too crazy about it.

When I walked in to grab the food, the service wasn't all that great. Not personable.  Overall, if you're looking for a quick bite that is cheap and fast, then don't hesitate to give this place a shot!"}

Located close to home, China Tango is on the corner of N Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. I've been meaning to write them a review for some time, so here it is. Whether I've dined in, gotten delivery or carry-out (I've done all three numerous times!) I haven't been disappointed with their food, service, and overall experience. It's been my go-to spot for fast, affordable Chinese food.

What I love:

- No MSG. Enough said.
- They offer brown rice. Healthy!
- Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers.
- Lunch specials are till 4pm. Who can always fit lunch before 2pm?
- Lots of vegetables. Crispy veggies too, not the gross wilted ones you get at other places.

They have all the traditional orders, from chow mein, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, fried rice, hot & sour soup, it goes on and on. Prices range from $7.25-$9.95. Lunch is from $5.95-$6.50, which includes fried or steamed rice & chow mein & egg drop soup (dine-in only). Complete family dinners start from $24.95 & they serve Thai tea or fruit smoothies with boba.

Most importantly, they've always been timely. Food is served fast, carry-out is ready, and delivery is always punctual. 

Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)"}

I noticed China Tango had four stars on here, so I gave it a try. I placed an online order and my food arrived 25 minutes later. It was so fast that when my doorbell rang, I was shocked and even asked "who is it?" because I didn't think it could be my dinner lol. The delivery guy was very nice and prepared with a pen and receipt. 

I ordered the dinner for one so I could get a little variety to try. It comes with an entree, rice or noodles, soup, and a small appetizer. I chose general tso's chicken, fried rice, and crab rangoon. (I'm not a big soup fan) the Rangoon didn't come with the usual red sauce, which was a let down. Everything else was pretty good for the price. Keep in mind, this is fast food Chinese! The fact that they delivery, aren't expensive, and food was pretty good, they get three stars. I would give it 3.5 if I could."}

I ended up ordering the stuffing waffle which is basically a waffle made from stuffing that is topped with mashed potatoes and turkey with brown gravy. I decided to order this since it is currently one of their specials. The waffle itself was pretty good in terms of flavor because I was actually able to taste the stuffing. I loved how crispy the waffle was, but unfortunately half of the waffle ended up being soggy because of the moisture and heat from being covered by the mashed potatoes and turkey. I think the dish would have been better if everything was plated separately instead of on a stack. The portion is pretty big and I'd say it's enough for two people. The turkey was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor. I wish I had more gravy for my mashed potatoes because all of the gravy just ended up on the turkey itself. No one likes eating mashed potatoes without gravy right? 

Overall the food was decent, but the service was pretty good. The waiter was very personable and kept an eye on our table. I'd probably come back here and try some of their other dishes."}

I've always enjoyed the food at Metro. This was my first time to this location, the staff was very friendly.  This was also my first time ordering the steak philly, which I do not recommend.  First the positive, the bun is soft and yummy.  Now the ick, the meat was burnt and lacked flavor.  Also, I have a mushroom allergy and after eating almost half the sandwich, the last couple bites tasted strange so I opened it to notice mushrooms.  I had to get my check and leave so I could take some meds.  The fries were really salty and seemed old, I'd say the pickle had less salt lol. 

I will return to Metro, not this location and never will I order this sandwich.  

I would highly recommend if you want a perfect philly, go to Peppermill, it's worth the drive."}

It has been open approximately a year (used to dine here when it was Pick Up Stix).
  The atmosphere is more restaurant than take out. There is more of a wait person presence.
   Before you order your food, they bring you egg drop soup. I hope it is included with all dine in meals. Not too much later, they bring crunchy noodles with duck sauce. If you order soda, they will fill it at the fountain for you. Last but not least, they will deliver your entree with the included fried rice and chow mein noodles.
  The lunch special tops off at $6.50. Soda is not included. The bill for the lunch special with a soda totals up to close to $10 before the tip (a tip jar).
   I rate China Tango four stars. The quality, starting from the crunchy noodles to the fortune cookie is high.
  A word of advice: Look at the menu outside. Once your inside, they'll sit you down, and before you know it they'll be serving you egg drop soup. This could make some people, myself included, feel awkward if there is nothing here that suits your taste."}

They seem to know what they're talking about. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and sat immediately at the counter. The counter seats look directly into the kitchen, and I really liked that I could watch the food being cooked and listen to the interactions between the servers and the kitchen staff. The kitchen staff even greeted me and interacted with me throughout my visit there, which I personally enjoy because it really makes me feel welcome. Service and comfort are the biggest things to me when it comes to rating and reviews, and this place nailed both categories.

The food was just as good! I had the challa french toast breakfast special, which came with eggs, bacon, has browns, french toast, and an English muffin. If I had eaten anything at all today, I would probably not have been able to finish it all. The French toast was delicious and the fruit on top of it added some good sweetness and tart to balance it out (bananas and strawberries). The bacon was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right. The hash browns were well done and a little too crispy for me, but this being my first time it was a learning experience. I'm sure if I ordered them differently they would have nailed it. Absolutely wonderful.

Overall, between the great service, friendly interactions, and delicious food, this place got an easy 5 star from me. I'll be back for sure and it will be an easy recommendation to make for friends/family looking for a good breakfast here in henderson."}

From the many pics of past customers who also ordered this from China Tango, the pictures looked promising... 

I called in my take out order and within 15 minutes I arrived to pick it up. China Tango is located in the Smith's shopping center a few doors down from Rubio's. There's a decent amount of parking directly in the front. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side with about 8 tables inside. Customer service is decent. 

So let's talk food: 

1) Honey Walnut Shrimp- I would give this 3.5 stars. The shrimps weren't as crispy as I like. This may be because I didn't dig into them right away. Might give them another try. Too much sauce was also found on the shrimp. Oh and this is expensive, $11.99 for this dish. 

2) Mongolian Beef- xxxspicy! This was also just okay for me. Too much sauce, wasn't spicy at all and there were noodles with this? Weird. The meat was slithery. Man, I really wished this was good. 

All in all, I don't think this will be my go to Chinese restaurant- still on the look out for my go to. Recommendations are always welcome!"}

At first I could tell that this was a mostly breakfast-oriented restaurant judging by the quality of breakfast food compared to dinner food. I would be rating this place 4 stars out of 5 because of that slight disparity, but they really stepped up their game with their dinner menu over time."}

Hosts were nice and it was a short wait to get seated as it didn't look like they were too busy (Sunday afternoon). 

After being seated we had to wait an extremely long time (~10 mins) before we were greeted by a server. Guy was very nice, took our drinks, and let us know that our actual server will check on us soon. During this wait we overheard the table next to us asking for a manager to complain about the service. Honestly, this should have been our first red flag. After waiting ANOTHER 5-10 mins our actual server showed up and took our orders. She didn't know how to work the ordering tool that well which was strange (Place just opened. Didn't you get trained?).

For the drinks, I tried the sweetened peach tea and it was super (extremely) sweet. Mixed it half and half with wife's water and it was still a bit too sweet but very tasty.

For the food, I got the Monte Cristo with chips which was excellent in taste and portion. The berry sauce it came with was equally amazing. I would recommend that dish if you're going to come here. 

The wife got the fish and chips which were terrible. I thought she was exaggerating so I tried some but they really were awful. The fish were soggy on the outside instead of crispy, they were totally bland and the tater sauce tasted more like relish in a cup. Would not recommend that dish to anyone. My wife just ended up having part of my Monte Cristo and left almost the entirety of the fish and chips. 

Mother-in-law got the bacon mushroom swiss burger with fries. She said the burger was extremely good but the fries were already cold when they reached the table. Brother-in-law got the bold city burger which he said was excellent (and looked excellent) but same issue with the fries.

During the meal we were checked up on by a few people, none of which were our server. Unfortunately no one refilled waters or sodas even once during the meal. The original person who took our drinks left the check for us which is weird (where is our server?). After finishing we waited another 5 minutes after the bus boy took our plates before the server sort of stumbled passed our table, noticed we were done, and asked us if we wanted a box for the fish and chips and took our payment.

In the end, this was a disappointing experience. The burgers and sandwiches may be good but a lot of work needs to be done with the service and I don't know how they could possibly fix the disgrace that they call their fish and chips.

Tl;Dr Service was bad. Burgers and sandwiches were good and the only thing that saved the meal. Fish and chips were a disgrace."}

We wanted a quick easy bite for breakfast after a long week where I had been ill for a few days. We had tried the one in the southwest part of Vegas and since this is now in walking distance if the need arises to actually walk some where. We arrived and were seated Immediately. Are waiter was really great, I forget his name, but he also works at Black Bear Diner so he was a familiar face. I had simple Sausage and egg breakfast with a side of B & G. Josie had Pancake Breakfast. The order came quickly and we enjoyed our meal. I will have to say the meals are not really stunning as Diner food goes. However, you get a great meal that fills the plate and your stomach. The staff is friendly and the wait for anything is minimal. Price wise it is on average with any diner in Vegas.
Thank you for Dining at Metro Diner. We will definitely return here. We would like to try lunch or dinner as well. It is quick and easy to get to and food is good. If in Henderson and you would like a great meal, check them out you will not be disappointed."}

Honestly, it's just a step up from Denny's. Their menu items offered here is better, ambiance is nicer, but that's just about it.

Came here couple times over the past few months, hoping I'd find something I can be excited about and tried different dishes each time. Nothing memorable to me, well, except pass on the grits here, the texture and taste are off. trust me.

Mr B loves their Monte Cristo. I had liked it too. But that last visit, it was heavy on the grease. The jam that it's served with was good too. I assumed it was made from scratch from what I read. But when I asked our server for more, she looked and pointed to the packaged jellies on our table and said just open those, they're the same thing. Okaay.

Service is friendly. Nothing more or less. It was on point when the servers had their trainers hovering over them. Last two visits, got seated right away, but it took more than five minutes for a server to acknowledge our existence. Plus they were forgetful. 

And whoever was the lead giving their employees evaluations, should use a little more discretion. Like do not do the employee evals at the boothes with patrons within earshot. Real tacky.  Employee got rated 3 cause she "needs to smile more"... which may be true, but how about how unprofessional evaluator was? I didn't need to hear that. 

Metro Diner still on the list to visit, just not as enthusiastic as others are."}

Me and my girlfriend ate here twice while visiting my grandparents at the end of September, it was great service and great food, 4 or 5 stars is what they rated based off of the regular diner experience but what really impressed me was the kindness they showed in the wake of one of the most tragic nights of our lives. My girlfriend and I were trapped inside the route 91 harvest festival the night of the shooting, we endured a horrifying ordeal while escaping the venue that night, we hardly slept when we arrived at my grandparents house that night but as the dust settled the next day my grandparents took us here for breakfast. I ate maybe 3 bites of my food, my girlfriend maybe double that, through the course of normal waitress conversation and the fact this was world news and we were in the town next to it only 12 hours later the waitress found out what happened, she talked to her manager, she talked to the regional manager I believe it was who just happened to be stopping by. They paid for all of our meals and extended their thoughts to us in this terrible time, they didn't have to do any of that but they did, that's a company that is run by real people unlike many others nowadays. The Polaroid at the bottom of the collage is all of us on our first visit that weekend before the shooting."}

I ordered one of their blackboard specials, a stuffing waffle covered in mashed potatoes, turkey, and gravy. It was really good and humongous. My wife had the Monte cristo, which was deep fried and delicious. 

I don't think I've been to a restaurant with such happy and nice staff before. They were all going over the top to make sure we were doing well. It was almost a little too much for my taste, but I can't fault them for that.  

It's a solid place. You can tell they care. The menu is inventive. I would definitely go back.

Everything tasted SO GOOD. I wasn't sure what quality the food would be but it was far and above any other 'diner' I've been to. I took the bananas out of the Yohala and it was perfect. My husband said his meal was better than Roscoe's.

Initially I had opted for delivery but since we lived beyond their 5 mile radius, I had to pick the order up. The food was ready when I arrived. I quickly surveyed the small restaurant and it did look very clean. We all thought that what we ordered tasted ok...not over the top. I'm a big fan of honey walnut shrimp but the way they prepared their version was different than what I'm used to. Most places I've been to have used a mayo glaze but at China Tango they use a mustard like glaze? The wonton soup was tasty.  Should I return, I'll dine at the restaurant and I'd like to give their chow fun or chow mein a try."}

The food is hot and fresh and I practically never have to wait if I order ahead of time. Their spicy level is just right for me. Just enough heat, but not too much where you can't taste the rest of your food. I order the crab Rangoon, General Tso chicken ( in spicy), eggplant tofu stir fry, salt and pepper chicken ( in spicy ). It comes with a side of white rice, so there is plenty of food for 2 and for seconds as well! Highly recommend."}

Really liked the feel of the place, staff was friendly and lots of comfortable seating. The menu is extremely accommodating for whatever you're in the mood for & breakfast is always available. Our server was helpful and we both picked the same entree in spite of all the choices. So...San Fran Eggs Benedict for both of us and I removed the Canadian bacon cause I wasn't paying attention or I would have asked for spinach instead. Asked for my eggs to be poached to a medium so the whites are done and they got that just right. They were good but we both thought the soggy English muffins were a bit of a bummer. Missed the crunchy texture because the eggs, tomato and avocado all soft, needed to be crisp muffin. Hash browns were crispy although a tad oily for me. All in all we both cleaned our plates and are looking forward to coming back and trying some other lunchie choices. Great place!"}

Of course no one could be like Thai BBQ but my mom and I needed our fix so bad! Last week we took out all the takeout menus and sat down and decided who we would order from and we picked China Tango!

I loved my whole meal except one dish! Really those are good odds LOL!
We ordered delivery and food came so fast and was still piping hot! Hot as in we didn't even need to microwave it at ALL! 

-Pad Thai
I was very disappointed by this dish, first off, the noodles were much thicker and they were bright orange! No peanuts or bean sprouts :/ The taste was just OK it wasn't that true pad thai I've had before :/

-Crab Rangoons
DELICIOUS! I've never had such a good amount of filling in my rangoons! Most places really skimp on the filing! They tasted so fresh and didn't feel like they were frozen!

-Potsticker
Not as good as the rangoons but still tasty!

-Steamed Vegetables
This was the winner! I really enjoyed the vegetables, they were tasty! Everything I ate didn't taste frozen or if it was sitting out! My mom and I could have ordered 2 of those!

-Chicken Fried Rice
This was just as good, just needed a bit of soy sauce!

Total: $39.00 (including delivery fee) Our food was solid, didn't taste like your typical greasy Chinese food! LOL

This is definitely going to be in our rotation of take out and would try other items!

Two friends and I had breakfast/lunch here today and can't rave  enough about both the food and the service.
Janice had a southern omelette that comes  with toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries.
Colleen had crispy bacon,  eggs and crispy hashbrowns that were absolute perfection. I opted for the meatloaf dinner that comes with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. The meatloaf,  along with the fried chicken and waffles are their most requested dinners and I can see why. Everyone of us absolutely loved the food....fresh, hot and perfectly done.  The only downside: the coffee could be a little richer with a little more body, but that's how we saw it.

The service is professionally served by people who know what they're doing.Be sure  to ask for Leah or Darlene, both outstanding servers. 
If you haven't been here yet,  be sure to try METRO DINER. The restaurant was crowded on Sunday as it should be; an indication that they're doing something right."}

I cannot speak for items other than the orange chicken, all the sides/appetizers, and the soups. So if you're a person that likes honey walnut shrimp, I can't say I would ever have it and if it's good or not.

I'm super picky on my Chinese because I often get super sick when I have it, I never have that problem here.

This is an EXTREMELY good lunch spot or typical chinese food takeout. If you're looking for a fancy place that you can instagram this isn't it, I think the $15 bill for 2 people is a good indicator that this isn't that type of place."}

For example the Combo Platter (egg rolls, butterfly shrimp, crab ran goons, paper wrapped chicken & BBQ pork.) The BBQ pork was Seriously hard as jerky and also red as the yelp banner.

They have quite a large selection to choose from and bless their heart and my taste buds, they serve breakfast and lunch items all day.

First off, the place is always clean. The guy handling the money doesn't handle the food and vice versa. I never have to worry about looking for the table with the least amount if food left on it from previous guests, because the staff keep them clean.  

The staff there are very kind and are patient as i always want to try something different so I may take a few minutes to figure out what I want or if I actually want it. The same people are always there and the guy at the front knows what my co worker is going to order when we get there. If you dine in you get bottomless fried wonton noodles which are so good! They are also very quick; when you order, the food is out in less than ten minutes. 

Rice is a big thing with me as I feel it can make a meal taste great or make you want to throw it in the garbage, but can't cause that's a waste. The rice, both fried and steamed is very tasty and not dry which is one thing I hate about rice at other restaurants. Also the rice isn't mushy. I usually get sautéed vegetables and I don't want my meal to end. The vegetables are so fresh and crunchy and the sauce they use is so magnificent I love it! Their chow mien also tastes great and I'm not too much of a chow mien person.   

Lunch specials are very inexpensive and are reasonably portioned. I almost always have left overs. The time for the linch specials goes till 4p, so if you go close to that time, you can have dinner too!

Overall, I choose this place over any other Chinese place in the area and I've been to almost all of them. Can't beat the cleanliness, service, prices and of course the food!"}

China Tango is the first restaurant that I felt deserving. My husband and I have consistently ordered from China Tango for the past few months... Honestly sad to say but average 2 to 3 times a week and they have not disappointed us. We have only used the delivery service so we are only able to review that service and the food. 

Order: 
We usually order through yelp but a couple of times we ordered over the phone. Both options are pretty speedy with no complications.

Delivery: 
The best delivery service ever! They are soooo speedy. From the time we order to the food arriving at our house about 20-30 mins top. 

Service:
Exceptional! They are very speedy and thorough. China tango has NOT made a mistake on any of our orders. And that's a lot to say since it has probably been more then 25 orders. Each and every requests we have made have been carried out. This last time we asked if they could make orange shrimp (not on their menu) since I do not eat meat and without hesitation, the guy over the phone says of course. And it was AMAZING. 

FOOD THE BEST PART: 
OMG China Tango is the best chinese food that I have eaten and I've eaten Chinese food everywhere! Everything is delicious! My husband loves their general tsao chicken and orange chicken. My favorite is their salt and pepper calamari and shrimp, kung pao shrimp, and sweet and sour soup! They have the BEST sweet and sour soup and the best thing is that you can choose your spice level.

Overall, 
If you are on the fence of trying china tango, Do It!!! Exceptional service and food. What else can you ask for?"}

It wasn't close to home but we thought the food was yummy so a little out of the way we drove....
So I was happily surprised when driving in Green Valley one day looking for somewhere to eat - I spotted China Tango.

We each tried a lunch special which consisted of free fried wontons,egg drop soup, eggrolls,fried rice, fried noodles (chow mein) and General Tsou's Chicken & sweet N sour chicken.

Fried wontons & egg flower soup - BLEH....
Veggie Eggrolls were filled with cabbage only and the cabbage was not even soft/cooked inside so it was a weird texture.

I asked if we could have white meat chicken instead of dark meat and the server said sure. I was happy about that.... Not for long - the pieces of the chicken looked big but the actual chicken pieces were so tiny that most of the chicken pieces were just crispy breading. Disappointing!!!!

The fried rice was OK but the fried noodles were bland and yucky. I don't enjoy fried noodles when it looks like spaghetti not chow mein noodles.
The server even walked by us and said "Guess you didn't like the fried noodles..." He suggested to us that the next time we come we should just order double fried rice. I'm not too sure if they'll be a next time....

The guy behind the counter was nice and they were accommodating in reguards to the request of white chicken and if my daughter can eat her slice of pizza inside but the food just wasn't what we remembered enjoying like at the Anthem location and my fortune inside my fortune cookie was freaky- it just said "Learn Chinese"..... The BF thinks my fortune was just prepairing me for the future."}

I open the door and it's heavy like it's spring loaded, we step in and sure enough the door slams behind us with a loud bang! Ooops I thought and I see the waitress cleaning the booths on the far wall, even with that loud booming door slam she didn't even acknowledge us, back turned to us and not even any eye contact or "hello, I'll be with you in a moment"  We take a table and still no welcome what so ever. We are both looking at her and she goes on wiping tables and not a glance our way. She is actually cleaning the rest of the booths and continues to ignore us. My wife says, "lets get out of here" and I thought so too, but I needed to eat before I went to work and so we stayed. I had to yell out, "could we get a couple menus?" and the waitress was really unwelcoming and cold. I am like, what in the world is she doing serving tables? Maybe she is working two jobs and is really burned out or someone pissed her off recently? but we are the only ones in the place.  As we looked over the menu some other people came in and she again acted like she didn't want to serve anybody. I've had better service at Carls Jr. and if they weren't a few miles away we would have went there instead.
The burgers were good and a 1/2 pound double was too much for our appetites. Fries were excellent and the cook with the black cap back there is doing a great job on the food. The waitress circled our table a few times, but never spoke to us to ask how everything was luckily my wife somehow got a refill on her drink. When she circled around us, I asked for our check and she was grovelling to herself and replied back like, "I"LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU AS SOON AS I COME BACK"  We left a few dollars tip and with that cold treatment from the waitress we over tipped in our opinion. People like that should not be serving food, we liked the food, but will never be back considering the unfriendly waitress."}

I work nearby and haven't been back to Henry's for at least a year because of a temporary job assignment that took me out of the area for a time. What a difference a year makes! Always enjoyed lunch here because the service was quick, the food excellent and the staff friendly. While our waiter was very nice and efficient - how can a place go downhill so fast? I was warned by my fellow employees (we have over 100) that it wasn't the same. An understatement. The 1/2 lb. burger was always large with 2 patties and a great bun. The one I received for lunch last week was much smaller and looked smushed. And the cheese!?!?!? I guess it was cheese. Ordered cheddar but what was on my burger looked liked some kind of secret sauce. (And I don't want to know what the 'secret' is). It was like an orange wet spread. My wife told me that they were using 'cheap' cheese and that's why it 'melted' like it did (more like 'liquified'). SO DISAPPOINTED! How can a place like this stay open? Is it under new ownership? Management? The food was always like homemade. Their special St Patrick's Day offering was always incredible but I can't bring myself to return again. So sad.

First off, we went on a sat. night, around 730... walked in and there were plenty of empty tables, but most were filled with empty plates and cups from the previous guests.  we stood around for about 5 min not sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait.  so we waited and wactched the 2 waitresses scurry around avoiding us til one said just sit there.  we finally ordered 10 min later and in the time at least 3 more groups of people had walked in, stood around and then left due to being avoided.  the food came out fast, and it was tastey, except for my undercooked chicken that i finally let the waitress know about once she came back 15 min later, she quickly apologized and offered to fully comp my chicken dish and offer me something new, but it was ok.

food was great: chicken wings, fries and chicken fried steak... southwest chicken salad... eh

service was VERY slow...
 
but all in all, it was ok... just have to be patient"}

Recently my Mom and I were on our way to another nearby restaurant, but I realized that we were so close to Henry's that we should just stop, so we did.  And I am glad we did!

Located in a strip mall off Stephanie St., it's kind of hidden away.  Kind of a random spot for a 24 hour bar/restaurant.

First of all, only the bar side is actually open 24 hours.  The restaurant side closes at 10pm on weeknights (not sure about weekends).  After the restaurant closes, you have to be 21 to dine, since it's in the bar.  No big deal.

We entered the restaurant and were approached by the server, who told us to sit wherever we like.  We chose a booth and she gave us menus.  They have quite a selection!  From appetizers to salads, to burgers, pasta, steak, etc!

My Mom and I just about always share everything.  We decided to split the 1/2 size cobb salad, the 1/2 size mac 'n cheese and the ribeye steak.

The first thing you should know is that the portions here are pretty big.  Come hungry!  Our salad was good and came with all of the typical fixin's - hard boiled egg, bleu cheese, olives, avocado, bacon, chicken, etc.  It was larger than we expected, and pretty good.

The mac n cheese came in a large bowl, and I couldn't believe it was only the 1/2 portion.  It's supposedly made with 5 cheeses and roasted red pepper, which added a different touch.  I don't think it was a my favorite ever, but it was OK.  I would like to go back and try the habanero hamburger mac n cheese.  Sounds right up my alley!

Our ribeye was huge and cooked perfectly (medium rare).  It came with a side of snap peas and we chose jasmine rice for something different.  Everything was really tasty.  Unfortunately, the server mentioned that they are changing the menu and the ribeye will only be available for about 2 more weeks.  Then it will be replaced by a t-bone.

We were pretty stuffed, but couldn't pass up trying the brownie dessert.  Holy crap, this is a chocolate lover's heaven!  It was a LARGE brownie, topped with hot fudge, vanilla ice cream, ANOTHER LARGE BROWNIE (!!), more hot fudge and then whipped cream and cherries.  It was humongous and way more than we could eat.  Very rich as well.  I would definitely recommend this for all of you with sweet tooths!

The service was fast and friendly, although there wasn't really anyone else in the place while we were there.  The server also mentioned to us that just about everything is home made.  They don't buy anything frozen, they roast all of the meats in house, etc.  That's good to know!

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner.  I would definitely go back, and I have to return to try this graveyard special burger everyone raves about!"}

After a day of apartment hunting we were starving and this place came up. AMAZING service. Nothing fancy. It was pretty empty but that actually enhanced the experience for us. Our waitress was AWESOME and pretty much had the entire place to herself which allowed her to spend a little more time with each table. There are times when you go to a restaurant and you feel rushed because they're so busy. Not here. She gave us time and was available to answer any questions we had. 

I had the Savannah burger and OH MY GOD was it delicious. Cooked to perfection. My wife had a burger as well and enjoyed as well as my mother in law who had a salad and was highly impressed. We split the brownie sundae for dessert and left excited and FULL. 

This place is great if you just want some delicious food and SPACE to enjoy it. There is a bar section on the other side, but it's kinda dark and smokey so we decided against it. I'm sure the service is just as good in there."}

I've always wanted to try them out but never made the attempt. My friend and I were at Costco the other night, and after a long shopping trip, were starving...plus all the sample carts were closing shop for the day :( .    He mentioned Henry's, I agreed, I had never been there, let's do it. We got there, and upon walking in it looks like a hole in the wall place...but honestly, hole in the wall places have the greatest portions of comfort food, which is very prevalent where I come from so it was fine by me!   The restaurant is on the left side, and there is a door to the bar on the right. Smoking is allowed in the bar, and there is gaming there as well.  It's on the small side but nice and quiet.  We asked for the menus, and my god....there is so much to choose from and it all looked super tasty!  Appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, prime rib sandwich! Dessert..omg! Bourbon bread pudding with a scoop of Thrifty ice cream!  YAY!  I ordered the BLT, and my friend had the club sandwich. We both had seasoned waffle fries.  The sandwich was perfect! His was huge!  He ate half and took the rest home for lunch! Not to mention the bar special is $1.50 bottles of Bud light Platinum for the rest of August! Killer deal! The food bill for both of us was $16.00, alcohol bill $13 for both of us. We're already planning a trip back there this weekend!"}

The owner fired Mary the graveyard bartender for no reason.  I spend 300 to 500$ a week gambling in there and have friends that only went on her shift.  The belief is that he did not want to promote within. I wish him the best luck because that is a horrible way to run your business.  She did a great job and has a good following and if u go on another graveyard shift there is no one there except for tumble weeds.  I encounter and speak to many people and will encourage to go somewhere else. Village pub is where I will be.  Better promotions for gamers.  I only went there because of her as did her following.  I would never want to go where they serve food to underage patrons on graveyard.  Which they did on the male bartenders shift.  So if u read this hopefully I will c u at village pub."}

I kept it basic with an avocado grilled cheese and waffle fries and my dinner date got some fancy burger. Both were aight just not amazing. We were the only people there at 6pm which is prime dinner time. I would give this place another try and pick a better dish to give it a shot since everyone seems to drool over this place in reviews. It has a small town cottage vibe like you stopped into a diner on Route 66. A-OK."}

Kim did an AWESOME job keeping everything flowing as best she could.  The cooks were ok today, the house salad was lacking, only two cucumbers instead of the normal other then that is was only carrots, tomatoes and lettuce.  This was disappointing and will be brought up next time I am in.

They were two cooks and they were working non stop but skimping on things is not the way to get things done.

Anyway, still at the top of the list for burgers, wings and the staff is always friendly and enjoyable."}

The server was great, she checked up often, offered her recommendations, and overall demonstrated a friendly demeanor.

I rate this 3 stars because of the lack of sanitation we witnessed when dining in. They hired this older waitress who must've never been in the food industry before or was just plain careless. 

She was serving a large group of people and when she brought their food out she placed her entire hand on top of this girl's hamburger instead of holding both of her hands on the side/under the plate like you're supposed to do. Seconds later she checks on another table and they ask for extra napkins and she wiped her hand on it and gave it to the customer. 

I guess I'm more baffled at the fact between both instances neither customer spoke up. If it wasn't for witnessing that this place probably would've gotten at least 4 stars. All I can say is luckily we had the server with common sense."}

I wish restaurants could make right but I guess its not economical. All you do is open a bag of chips. Stop trying to fry your own. You then put guacamole cheese not nacho unless its really good cheese sour cream and use a scoop. Add chicken which I didn't but it wouldn't of mattered. A good salsa olives etc. If people can't make right don't put it on your menu or make really good in smaller portions."}

Feeling lazy, we walked over to Henry's for some comfort food. Before we walked in there was a chalkboard listed with the daily specials: split pea soup and chicken stroganoff. Instantly, I felt like I was going to have dinner at some American's household. We walked in around 2pm and the restaurant section was completely empty. The bar section had a few of customers inside video gaming and drinking. (The bar and restaurant is sectioned off by a door. As soon as you enter, you are in the restaurant and you just need to open the door on the right to get to the bar.)

Pros: 
We ordered fish & chips and club sandwich. The fish & chips came with cole slaw and for the club sandwich we got a side of pasta salad. The portions were huge; I'd say 4 people could have shared this meal. We liked the quality of the fish & chips because they used actual filets (and not mystery fish meat) and we liked the coat of crispy batter. The fries were decent, nothing remarkable. The club sandwich was a hit! They packed it in with real turkey meat (not turkey ham) and layers and layers of ham. All in all, it was a solid American lunch. 

Kimberly was our waitress and she was really friendly and was great at her job. We ordered a diet coke and she brought a pitcher of it so we don't have to keep asking for refills. How convenient!

Open 24hrs!

Cons: 
The decor is not welcoming or comforting at all. No real sunlight gets into the restaurant (windows are tinted), the booths are designed with tacky patterns, there are wine bottles held on these wirey frames (uhm...is it a wine tree?) and there are reminiscent 1920's-1930's bar pictures. And due to the adjacent bar, some of the cigarette smoke leaks into the restaurant. In my opinion, it'd be better to visit Henry's at night after a couple drinks. 

BTW: It cost $0.40 extra to get a side of ranch! I don't mind the cost, but seriously? 

Current promotions:
Monday Pro-football Specials (3-10PM): $1 hot dogs, $1 coors light drafts
Saturday & Sunday (9AM-6PM): $5 off any large pizza, $5 coors light pitchers (in house special only)

OMG these are terrific - a great bargain for great quantity and quality food.

I first came here way back in July when I had just moved out here. My friends were coming to visit, and they had been stuck in traffic for a long time...resulting in them arriving hours past when they were supposed to. Yelp for late night food brought me to this gem. The first time I went, my friends and I, looked at the prices of their graveyard specials and assumed it would be small portions. We couldn't have been more wrong. The portions were very generous! Especially considering the price. I think we accidentally ordered enough to feed an elephant...if an elephant ate cheeseburgers, nachos, pizza, and the like.

I've gone back a couple times since...and every time the food is consistently delicious and a steal. My favorites are the pulled pork sandwich and garlic parmesan chicken tenders. Their pizza is pretty good too. The pulled pork sandwich has just enough kick to it make it something special. The flavor in the garlic parmesan chicken fingers is delicious - I like that they use from what I can tell, shredded parmesan and fresh garlic - not just like powdered parmesan. The teriyaki ones are pretty good as well. Quality and quantity of pizza and toppings is also really good as well as the size of the pizza itself.

The pulled pork sandwich is this big monster...there is a fork in the napkin roll...use it...it will be your friend. The tenders are only $1 each (though they're sold in pairs). These tenders aren't your McDonalds mighty kids fingers...no sir...each one is like the size of my hand. There are 11 preparations you can choose from too to suit your fancy.

In terms of service...it's as fast as it can be given the circumstances. When I go late at night, there's only one person there running the place both bringing orders and working the bar...I think his name is Tom. My guess is there's very few people in the kitchen, maybe even only one. When it's busy, service can be a bit slow (i.e. friday, saturday night). - so I guess this is kind of a quasi complaint. But since there's only one person there running himself ragged, I'm not taking off points. He's also really friendly no matter how busy it is, which I really appreciate.

My one complaint is that the bar area is pretty smoky. Ventilation isn't great. But it's tolerable.


One of these days, I do need to come back to try food on the regular menu, but when I come here late at night, it seems like too much of a shame to not take full advantage of the graveyard specials.

Thank goodness for this place to satisfy my late night munchies. i do stay up late much more than I should...and I'm really glad i found this gem. The value for food from the graveyard menu really can't be beat."}

One waitress and 1 other table. Asian chicken salad? Cabbage swimming in dressing, topped by a scarcely cooked chicken breast. Took one bite and inspected the sliced breast - not thoroughly cooked. Waitress is nowhere; after about 10 minutes I took it to the cook myself. He argued that it was indeed cooked; further cooking would burn it. I asked him to return it to the grill anyway. He used his HANDS to pluck slices off the top, then grilled them. After a few moments of sizzling (which seemed promising) he used a spatula to return the slices to my salad while I stood at the service counter. I brought the plate back and bit into a piece of chicken that still had that unmistakable raw texture. Waitress still nowhere. I couldn't even nibble the sad heap of cabbage. Finished my wine, which was supposed to be Pinot Grigio; not sure what sort of wine it actually was; color and flavor more like Chardonnay. Left hungry.

Henry's is that place. There is a good variety of tasty food and the staff is at your table just enough to take care of your needs, without being overbearing. 
The bar is next to the restaurant, but it is separated by glass and doors. On the way out I did catch a whiff of cigar smoke from the bar, but it wasn't near the booths where we were eating.

The wings were over cooked, they were supposed to be garlic Parmesan, what used to be a lot of garlic and Parmesan, now is barely garlic and Parmesan.  They just were not the same, they used to be covered in garlic and Parmesan.

The BLT was good but again something from the taste was missing.  It seemed like the bacon was not only over cooked but it almost seemed like they are using a different kind then they used to.

This was a great place for comfort food now it is just an ok place.  They do not have wifi still so that makes it inconvenient as a place to hang or meet with people if you need Internet access.

So who can say no to a place that has waffle cut fries on the menu? In we went. On a side note my gps told me it was on the wrong side of the road, so if you are starting and not seeing it anywhere..It's on the west side of the street.

Anyway. We were promptly greeted by a server who was very friendly. The menu is huge, which I love and hate. I was the kid that was so torn between choosing between candy choices as a kid that my mom would actually have to do a countdown for me and it ALWAYS was a last minute selection.... and I still.have that problem. Anyway. I got the... crap.. It's the brisket sandwich on focaccia with roasted peppers, sports, gouda, horseradish.. Ugh my memory. My husband got the German burger and even though.we did not need it, we got  order of the habenero hamburger Mac and cheese.. when in Rome. 

Food was prompt. I live that we got mini pitchers of our drinks. So much easier. Those were refilled And I never faced an empty glass while needing to cool down my fiery habenero mouth.

My sandwich was delicious. A great flavor combo and I was thankful for having unique menu options too choose from. I hate having to choose between a cheeseburger, chicken fingers, and a club. Boring. The only complaint I had was by the time I.Got to the end it was a little soft and started to fall apart on hand.

The Mac was delightful. Definitely NOT shy on the habeneros. Definite heat. We.live on spicy food (like I go.through more cayenne than any spice in my.cabinet..salt included) 

Hubbys burger was oddly good too. I really.worried because it arrived in all of its messy topping glory, which I.knew my husband would have no patience for one it started to.squish out the sides and fall apart. Shockingly, it didn't. Amazing! I'm not  kraut fan at all but.I.sampled a bite.and the flavors all worked together. 

The prices are decent. You.get plenty of food and it is very good. I'm.glad we tried something new and am happy to add it to the rotation.

So, for some good tasty food with excellent friendly service give it a whirl."}

The reviews, tips, and pics had me sold before we were even there. My only main question is this- how the hell did I not know about a 24/7 spot, that's close to my house, that me and my bf can eat salads and appetizers and entrees for $34?!!??! All together we ordered: 2 sodas, a nachos app, a gravy fries app, a 1/2 size house salad, 1/2 size POTW (pasta of the week), and a nacho burger. 
Originally we ordered the gravy fries along side the burger, but she brought out a whole order. We weren't complaining, especially when it wasn't any extra on our tab! The house salad was good. Fresh with yummy dressing. The nachos were bomb. I love good nachos and these had chili and cheese with sour cream and green onions then a side of jalapeños and salsa that went great with it. The POTW was chicken curry with mushrooms and onions. This was the only thing I wouldn't order again. Not that it was bad, the chicken was cooked right and the veggies were good. It was just bland. It lacked the flavor you expect from anything with curry in the title. My bf devoured his nacho burger, it had cheese oozing out the side that went on his fries. (Who doesn't like cheesy fries) so yes he has cheesy fries and gravy fries, don't judge. 
My only negative observation was they seemed understaffed. I watched all of my food sit in the window for 1-3 minutes before being served to me. All the while there was a second waitress who looked like she wanted nothing to do with the other one, nor her tables as she wouldn't even make eye contact with us. Our waitress, (Kimberly was the name on the ticket) was still great and even apologized for being so rushed. 
Overall I had a good experience and can't wait to return to try the mushroom blue cheese burger. And probably many other things as well. 
Thanks Shirley B. and Vegas J. 
Shirley and I are already known for running into each other randomly so maybe I will see you guys there one day!"}

Was delighted both times.  Had the Prime Rib the first time (was "gambling" ordering that in a restaurant that's a bar-casino) and was pleasantly surprised how good it was (especially considering the low price), waitress was very polite and efficient.  Ordered a pasta-chicken "special" recently and couldn't have been more pleased.  Again the service was perfect and even with desert, the check total was a "bargain".  My only complaint is they don't have COCA-COLA !"}

This has the making to be one of the best American dinner restaurant in all of Henderson, Nevada.    

Major issue is the management is very  petty about charging additional fees for substituting  very minor items is going to hold the restaurant from getting the fifth star .

If a customer wants a Turkey dip and wants to substitute turkey for roast beef there shouldn't charge a fee to switch the two meats. 

Granting a small change for a customer at no charge, will get you return business!

We really enjoyed the food, however we like turkey dips too and at most other restaurants that serve both turkey and Roast beef they will all substitute turkey for beef.

What ever makes the customer happy right!"}

When they get it all right - it is fantastic and the food is wonderful. But, when they get it wrong, it is really bad. 

Our family favorite is Thursday night, prime rib night. Most of the time the food is right on. But, I have eaten there where the rolls have been over cooked, prime rib is over cooked, vegetables look like they have been around since the beginning of time and then on top of it, the food is served cold. There breakfast is good and burgers are a great deal. Service isn't good if the motorcycle club is there. Too many people to be served at once. We have suffered through this enough, that we no longer go when we see the club there. When club isn't there, service is fantastic.

I wish that the food could be good all the time or at least most of the time."}

I ordered the rib eye steak. Medium well. Im a weenie when it comes to medium rare. MAYBE in the future I'll try it. The rib eye was ok. The taste was mediocre and I also needed to add salt and extra pepper since it was a bit bland.

Walking into the bar area you do get a big whif of cigarettes. You can also dine in the bar area but we decided to be away from the cigarette smell and dined in the dining area. 

I ordered the southwestern burger and my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich. 
A M A Z I N G !!! 

Make sure you come with an appetite because the portion size is pretty big . 
Both meals had lots of yummy flavors and some spice to it. 
My burger was filled with pepper, jalapeños, cheese onions and everything yummy! My husband loved his meal too. I loved that they filled is sand which with lots of pulled pork. They weren't greedy with that at all. 
Will definitely be back !"}

Henry's had PLENTY of room, and now I understand why. As soon as we got there, our eyes began burning from the smoke drifting in from the bar next door. My wife whispered to me when I noticed it, but we were trying to be nice since someone else was picking up the tab.

There were 3 tables occupied when we got there. It took almost 15 minutes before someone came for our drink order, and we barely interacted with our server for the remainder of the meal. The soda was flat, but she was nice enough to bring us each our own mini-pitcher. I ordered the ribeye (med-rare) and a Caesar salad. The salad was absolutely drowning in dressing and soggy.

Well over an hour after we sat down we finally had our entrees. The steak was good. Not exceptional, but more than I had expected. Some parts of it were over-charred/dry and it really detracted from the natural flavor of the meat. It was a very fatty/sinewy cut, and I felt mislead by the quality promised on the menu. They served it with peas that didn't seem to be seasoned at all and could have come right out of your grocer's freezer.

The fries and barbecue sauce were a bright spot. Both had great flavor and were absolutely addicting. Unfortunately that didn't save a very disappointing dining experience."}

Beer was good and nice and cold, not flat or warm.  Generous amount of peppers and onions on the sandwich.  Was hot fresh and tasty. Prime rib was cut nice with little fat but still juicy and tender.  Only criticism would be that the bread got a little soggy.  Ended up eating second half with fork and left bread.

Yelp is typically pretty accurate. Brought my wife and kids. The place is half restaurant  half bar. Separated by a glass door. 

The food

We'll start here, 'cause that's what's important.
we ordered the fried clams (pretty good), "the world's best" macaroni......not so much. I'm pretty sure it had turned bad already. Everything else was barely mediocre. 

Service

Our waitress was a very nice lady, but unfortunately the worst waitress.....ever. she took forever to do anything. She was around, just didn't react to things you'd expect. Missing silverware and napkins. You basically were better off getting things from the kitchen yourself. 

Location

Outside looks good. Inside, the smoke smell was like the old Klondike casino. I am a hardcore smoker, and don't mind indoor smoke smell when I'm drinking or with buddies, but I want my kids to choose whether they want to smoke or not. It definitely should not be advertised as a family establishment."}

It's in the same strip mall as the place we mail packages, so I've driven by it several times.  Today, we finally had lunch here.  The dining room is bigger than you would expect given its location, with room between most of the tables.  They had some pushed together, but it was not close to being crowded, so it didn't matter.  We were waited on immediately (service was excellent throughout the meal), and as a few yelpers note, they leave a pitcher of your selected beverage (for us, Dr. Pepper and water) at your table.  Also, I request a lot of ice in my fountain drinks.  The server brought me a whole glass of ice in addition to the pitchers.  The glasses at Henry's are large, so the pitcher was about a refill, maybe a little more.  But, I feel like this touch demonstrates a little care for the customer.  Also, we all know how frustrating it can be to eat, finish your drink, and you can't get the server's attention for a refill while you are still eating.  I wish more restaurants would adopt Henry's practice.  They probably lose a little bit of soda or tea when pitchers aren't finished, but that's maybe 2 cents worth of liquid, well worth it to provide better service in my estimation.

We had chips and salsa to start.  The salsa was good consistency, not runny like some chains, but also not totally chunky like pico de gallo.  The chips needed some salt and weren't warm, but that's not a huge issue.  To eat, the wife had the shrimp dinner.  This is a fantastic deal, 7 large fried shrimp, a huge order of fries and a portion of cole slaw for $10.  The shrimp was not overly done, which can happen when it's fried.  Excellent consistency.  The fries are of a thickness between thin fries (think McDonald's) and steak fries.  The breading was crunchy.  Very very good fries.  I will say the ranch appeared to be from a bottle.  I couldn't say for sure, but it was probably the least impressive part of the meal.

I had the bourbon BBQ burger with waffle fries.  This was a very juicy burger.  It's a large burger consisting of 2 patties on an onion bun.  I could have used more fried onions.  They are smaller, not the longer shoestring type onions.  So, they often fell out.  It was tough to get a complete bite of all the ingredients together.  The bacon was very VERY crispy.  I'm okay with it this done, but a lot of people aren't.  I had to finish the burger with my fork it was so messy.  But, it was fantastic.  And, it was only $9.  I didn't even finish the waffle fries, there were that many on the plate.  These were large and very well seasoned.  

Although we didn't go into the bar, it looked comfortable.  A large bar with a couch area that had a couple of chairs.  Looked to be very cozy, and had a few people in around 1 pm on Sunday.

We will definitely return, and like I said, I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner."}

We started with gravy fries, something every diner in NJ had growing up.  I have to say, these are some of the best gravy fries in Las Vegas.  Crisp, startchy fries covered in a gooey gravy that reminds me of... well, hometown diners.

For our main course, my daughter had buttered pasta which was shells.  It could have used a little more flavor but she enjoyed it.  The two large pieces of garlic bread was too much for a kids meal and one half piece would have been sufficient. (This is not a negative, but more of a suggestion that would both save money and keep the kids from eating too many carbs.)  I went with the fried clams.  The clams themselves were real clams, chewy and stretchy.  They would have been great but the coating was overcooked and to heavily coated so it was difficult to get the clam flavor without peeling off the coating. Next time I will try one of their specials like country fried steak. 

For desert we split a fudge sundae.  The staff was happy to take the peanuts off for us even though the menu stated they were on there and we just didn't pay attention.  

Service was excellent. Our server was very attentive, very honest about the menu options and made sure we had everything we needed several times.

I enjoyed that they bring a whole pitcher of tea or lemonade to your table so you don't have to find them for a refill.  Henry's is a great addition to the Henderson cuisine.  I am hopeful my next trip will raise the rating a star."}

At first it was because Dyanna L told me they had $3 bloody mary's on Sunday's during football. But the food is excellent as well! Plus, super reasonably priced considering how much food you get.

So right off I ordered a Bloody Mary. Be prepared to wait. The waitress rocks, it's just there is only one of her, but it's worth the wait to me. My drink was super strong and tangy! Just how I like it. It also came with a lemon and olive for garnish. As for their other drinks like soda, tea or water they serve it to you in a little pitcher so you can refill it yourself. I love that!

Some of my favorite items to order include the Gravy Fries. They have a brown or white gravy. I really love the brown. Coupled with the super crisp fries the gravy is a perfect salty/savory kick. I have gotten their Club Sandwich which is huge!! I always get it with rye bread. (They don't list it as a side option, but if you ask you can order a side salad instead of their other choices.) The Pesto Chicken sandwich on focaccia is full of flavor and the chicken was moist and not over cooked. Also, I really enjoy their regular house salad. Joel loves their Baked Ziti. If you love pasta this place has a weekly pasta special. They also serve breakfast ALL day on Sundays.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back. You can choose to sit in the restaurant part or the bar area. You can get the specials no matter where you sit. 

This place is a winner for me. Great food and tasty drinks. They need maybe one more waitress on busy days. The one they have is super friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back to try something else off their tasty menu!"}

The food was tasty, generous and served hot and fast.  And did I mention well priced.  I had a drink and it was a healthy pour.  We ate in the restaurant side, the bar looked a bit sketchy.  My son had a burger that was huge and I am a club sandwich fan so went that route.  I am a big guy but could not get my mouth over a quartered hunk of that sandwich.  The only reason they aren't a 5 star is the decor and that the sandwiches were out of scale.  Server was very nice, great food, well priced and pretty easy to find.  Give it a try if you are looking for good pub grub or comfort food and don't need the restaurant chain overlay."}

The cheaper burger doesn't come with a side but fries are only $2.50.  The onion rings and fries were great.

After a nice long afternoon and evening slumber and a few TV episodes, I was pretty famished. It was well past midnight, and I had just the place in mind: Henry's.

Upon entering the anteroom, I saw the sign to hit the doorbell if the inner door was locked, so I did that and smiled for the camera (look up and to the right). The door clicked and I walked in. I saw the restaurant to the left and a bar to the right, where seemingly everybody was. Since I didn't feel like eating my food through the stench of cigarette smoke, I sat on the restaurant side.

The late night menu was exciting to see. Available from midnight until 7am, it offers a decent array of options including a couple breakfast options, some nachos, salads, and soup. I was destined to get the burger, however, and opted for the $1.99 hamburger. Couldn't justify adding $1 for a $2.99 cheeseburger, even if it would have been that much yummier. Also got the crunchy fries for $1 and added an "appetizer" of two garlic parm chicken fingers, learning later that it's actually $1.00 for each finger even though the menu says to order by twos.

I was still a little hazy with the passage of time and such, but it probably took 10-15 minutes. For all I cared, it could've taken half an hour and I wouldn't have been too concerned, given a prior experience at a late night place. It just so happened that one moment I was looking at my phone, and the next I saw three red plastic trays on the counter at the kitchen. The cook soon asked me if those were my items, given that the only other guy was still in the bar. I indicated as such and he brought the trays out to me.

FOOD! Oh yes, I had waited for this, and I was ready to enjoy it. I grabbed a chicken finger first, and I noticed it was still hot, and oh so greasy. A little too greasy. I later saw a huge pool of oil at the bottom of the paper and got just a little freaked out. I think the fingers were a little overdone, but they were still pretty good. The complementary ranch definitely helped out. Grease aside, there's so much meat here for $1 that you'd be doing yourself a disservice going anywhere else during these hours.

The burger was a treat. There's lettuce, grilled onions, tomato, slightly too many pickle slices, and a special sauce that I couldn't tell you much about except that it was delicious. The burger was well done, but you can't win every single time I guess. I just have no idea how you're going to beat this value for $1.99.

The fries were also ridiculously good. They're cut pretty thick, floured a bit, and reportedly brined before frying, and they were just super fluffy and maintained that outer crunch throughout the night. And they sure lasted that long since the order is so dang huge! You can easily share this between 2 or even 3 people, but I braved the pile as a loner. They actually held up flavor-wise too until the last handful, where I finally asked the cook for the ketchup. Probably should've asked for the ketchup even earlier, but I was too stubborn.

I've only eaten out a few times after midnight, but it still shouldn't have taken years for me to visit this place. Henry's was one of those places that I'd heard about for a little while but hadn't bothered to visit. Now, it's one of those places that I'd love to visit again and again if I'm ever awake at the proper time."}

I guess that's a good way to start this review.   So, I'm out in Hendo doing some shopping and  was getting a bit hungry.   I had heard some good words about Henry's from a guy at work so I figured I'd track it down.   I'm my opinion it's a bit hard to spot because it's located in a shopping plaza and the only signage is on the doors (at least what I could see). You have to know what you're looking for to spot it.  One side is a bar (with machines) which is closed off from the restaurant side.   I did my eating in the restaurant.   Very spacious and clean with four tvs to keep you busy.   The staff (Kimmy) was very pleasant and very helpful with the menu.  Additionally,  I ordered iced tea and not only did she bring me a full glass, she brought a mini pitcher full as well  The pizza,  bbq, and burgers get good reviews so I decided to go burger today.   The Farm Burger to be exact.   Sweet 6lb Baby Jesus, how big should a burger be?!  Two beef patties, fried egg, bacon, plus the normal veggies with  a side of slaw.   Very  very tasty!!  And not crazy expensive.   I think I rounded out at around $12.  I decided to write my review while I'm in the restaurant, cuz I can't move at the moment  Try it,  you'll love it."}

Bar side is open all night. Food is comfort stuff. So that's not so bad. the cook was not attentive and over cooked our steaks by a degree. with only four levels of cooking this is pretty bad.  Tasty shoe leather went down  better than you'd assume due to proper seasoning. Over all not pleased. Wait staff was courteous and attentive to our party of four + 1/2 so at least our visit late friday night was pleasant. 

Be careful on meat orders and do not ask for medium. the cook does not know what that means. He prefers rare, med rare, med well or burn-it for cooking desire."}

We've passed by hundreds of times and never really noticed it but we wanted something different and it came up with great reviews on yelp. We got the Mac n cheese for our daughters to share and it was  super cheesy and delicious. Since it was raining I wanted something warm so I ordered the pot roast and my hubby got chicken fried steak. Mine was a huge portion of tender pot roast with a delicious gravy and potatoes and carrots. The chicken fried steak was really good too! The prices can't be beat and our waitress (Kimberley I think?) was just so incredibly sweet. She brought out pitchers of iced tea so we never ran out of drinks, brought a to go cup of lemonade for my daughter and just had an awesome personality. Great service can make or break a restaurant and she really made it that much better. Perfect little spot for a nice, inexpensive and tasty dinner. They need to advertise more because I'm sure a lot of people have no idea what they're missing!"}

There is just something about the colors and decor or maybe even the word fonts themselves that make me almost shriek. I've driven by the place a million times over the past 8 years and never went in. Thought I'd give it a try after reading reviews here.
 First time we went we got pot roast and a bleu cheese burger. Consider yourself warned, this burger is HUGE, and I think it's real meat not cheaper filler. This was made with two heavy patties and a bleu cheese sauce and waffle fries were good too. The pot roast comes with potatoes, carrots and a fresh roll. It was so tender you could cut it with a fork.
Went a few more times and tried soups and pastas. The pasta was exotic and different.
 The clam chowder was excellent. The turkey soup was good but slightly cold, all I had to do was send it back and I didn't bother asking.
 The waitresses are nice and attentive.
 If you ask for coffee you get a carafe, if you ask for water you get a pitcher. 
 We enjoyed lunch items, haven't tried pizza yet. We didn't dig the onion rings too much they too thick and the breading fell off making them kinda pointless.
 We tried the breakfast and it was OK. I think we ordered wrong for what we wanted, we got omelette's and the toast was cold and hard ( in their defense we are having a cold spell here and it was cold in there in general so hot toast wasn't gonna happen despite any efforts), The eggs were OK, nothing special, same with the hash browns. Then after we ate the waitress showed us the eggs and pancakes order someone else got and we were covetous... OK.. next time!! That plate looked to be more up our alley and a better deal. There are a few affordable breakfast items but some are over priced. If they served a cheap breakfast 24 hours I'd bet their clientele would beef up.
 We haven't done much dinner here or pasta, never tried that. Overall its very good American food, most items are a decent or big portion. The prices are kinda all over the place but you get options too like with the pasta special you can order a 1/2 portion for 1/2 price or you can get a single burger for less. 
 I think like anywhere else you just have to know what to order. If I could go up to 3 1/2 stars in the rating I would."}

We walked in and seated ourselves (hoping that was proper etiquette) in some rather spacious, long booths. The one front of house staff person delivered some tables' food, then brought us menus.

Perusing their offerings, I decided to give their "World's Best Mac & Cheese" a try. Since I wanted more than just cheesy pasta, I added the chicken option.

With our glasses of water, the server also brought out a small pitcher of water for us, which was nice to have handy!

Let's put it this way, one pound of mac and cheese, with a chicken breast makes for a HUGE plate of food to see appear before one's self. My wife and I both took exploratory bites of the pound of cheesy mac. It was....

...

Barely mediocre. 

The cheese was not very flavorful, there was an abundance of melted, yellow cheese throughout. 

The chicken was... well, it started out as chicken. It was grilled on an open flame, so the outside was charred pretty good and the inside was half dry and tough, half almost moist. There was no flavor beyond charcoal.

$16 for a pound of mediocre mac and cheese, with a burnt chicken breast? I think this place will not be getting my business again for a while.

My wife will review her food, as it was equally (or more) underwhelming than this dish."}

Touted as an American grill, they certainly have a lot to choose from. Pizzas, burgers and sandwiches are among the many, many menu choices. I had the Honey Fried Chicken salad with sliced apples and toasted almonds on my last visit. I know this isn't a NEW concept for a dinner salad, but I did enjoy that the breading on the chicken had a sweet honey flavor. It really went well with the honey mustard dressing.

All fountain drinks that you order always end up coming with a small pitcher on the side that will probably fill your drink two more times. Some would call this a lazy practice so the wait staff doesn't have to refill drinks, I think of it as a thoughtful touch.

They also have an extensive breakfast menu. I've only had the corned beef hash, which was delicious and plentiful. 

They have a sports bar feel going on, as there are a few TV's situated around with sports playing. I wouldn't say it isn't kid friendly at all.

Bottom line, reasonable prices, HUGE portions, great variety and good staff. I'd recommend Henry's for a causal meal with friends."}

This is one of my favorite places for comfort food which Frank takes a TON of pride in the quality and taste of the food.  If you get something here you do not like, let them know and they will fix it, however finding something that does not taste good will be hard.

The burgers are fresh ground with the highest quality meats that are made in house and the prices for the burgers are better then most places.

If you like alcohol type drinks, the bartenders are amazing and make some really good drinks and again the price is better then some happy hours.  Stop in and grab a bite, you will not be disappointed...."}

But this burger was perfectly cooked. Meat was good. Bun was fresh. Toppings were good. My friend got the Thursday prime rib special. Queen size for 14.99. He couldn't finish it., had to take half home.  The fries were very tasty.  Worth a return trip!"}

We went in last night and it was not packed when we got there, actually only one other table but within 30 minutes that place was packed.  Even with all the customers, the kitchen still delivered and no one left disappointed that I saw.

The BLT is the best in town, its the bacon that makes it and they know how to make it.  The salad was a little disappointing but like the head chef said last night, good lettuce even the organic kind is hard to come by right now.  We have noticed at the farmers markets that the same is true.

Other then that, the drinks are cheap and amazing, best bartendar's in town. 

A table next to us ordered chicken fingers which I have never had hear but from what I heard they are the best, so one day I may have to stray from the wings to the finger which may be hard but I may have to try it.

I will continue to go back here as I have never had a bad burger, wings, BLT, nothing. If you do have something bad here, send it back and they will go out of their way to fix it."}

I wanted to give this place a  better review, but in good conscience I can't recommend this place. I'll get to that, but a few good things to point out first.

The pulled pork sandwich was good, but they didn't toast the bun. So the sauce and the juice from the pork just turned it into inedible mush. But! Some pork on the fries with some cheese and jalapeños would have been awesome. Or just toast the bun. 

My wife liked her turkey sandwich dinner thing. Hot turkey sandwich or something. Normally served open face, but here they don't do that. 

Here's where the 1 star comes from: Ordered chicken wings. They were ICE cold in the middle. Hot on the outside, FREEZING on the inside. She offered to have them remade which I was fine with, but the second batch came out rubbery. So this tells me they aren't properly cooking and/or thawing the chicken. It's gonna get someone sick and even though I liked the pulled pork and the fries and my wife liked her turkey I can't suggest to you to go here if they can't cook wings safely. 

Our waitress was wonderful, the bar area was nice ( a little Smokey but not too bad. Didn't bother my wife with asthma). They had TV's but smaller ones so it was ok for watching a game but not ideal. 

Had the wings not been getting people sick would have gone 3 maybe 4 stars. But I doubt those bad food handling habits are isolated to just their wings."}

I just came back for the first time in two years and fell in love all over again. This time we got to try the Savannah burger, worlds best (hamburger habanero) mac and cheese, chips and salsa, and waffle fries. The food blew us away, especially the mac and cheese. For it being such a small little dive bar than goes unnoticed- the food is superb. We highly recommend the mac and cheese. Probably the best we've had (hence the name "worlds best". 

The service was also amazing. Our server Amberlyn (I'm pretty sure that's it) was so genuinely nice, timely, and made great recommendations.

I can see locals having a favorite item on the menu and rating this place a five, I can, but it's probably not ideal for people who aren't familiar with the menu and don't have a high tolerance for cigarette and cigar smoke.

The food was okay. The portions were enormous. The service was excellent. The restaurant was clean.

The overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke had a negative effect on our appetites and we couldn't do the portions justice. I ordered a burger, which included zero sides, and an order of their gravy fries. The burger was meh, the fries were fantastic (SERIOUSLY. If my entire experience was based solely on the gravy fries, it would be five stars.), and together they cost three times what a burger and fries ought to, even with the ridiculous serving sizes."}

The owners have put a little humor and a lot of taste ingenuity together to create a great little hot dog spot in Henderson.  The Dogs are unusual and delicious.  

Heads up - if you want a $1.50 hot dog go to the Fremont St. Experience because this isn't the place for you. You can guzzle crappy drinks with that dog.  This place is miles removed from that kind of experience.

I had the Mac & Cheese Dog which was delicious - it needs to have a little added but that is dependent on taste . . .a little salt . . . a little hot sauce.   The Mt. Fuji is not to be missed.  Next time in I'm going for the Carolina Slaw Dog and/or but most probably and the PBB&JJ dog.   

There are tater tots, crinkle fries and onion rings to go with the dogs. Over 50 kinds of cold vintage sodas, seating and a smiling staff.

The owner is engaging and fun to speak with. Without a restaurant to their name they dived into this creation and  I'm a fan.  The menu is diverse, the dogs are unusual and good, the place is fun and we will return often!"}

I cannot tell you how good my hotdog was! The dog itself tasted like a sausage, not a ball park hotdog.  Plus the crispy bacon took it to a whole other level.  The mac and cheese topping was so cheesy it tasted better than it sounded on the menu.  I tried my friends loaded tots and they were just ok. However I would like to try the salchipapas on their menu next time! Salchipapas are french fries with hot dog bits on top and other miscellaneous toppings.

When we were done, someone from the back came and cleared our table, even though we could have done so ourselves. This is a great establishment, and I will definitely be back here in the future!"}

After the steam subsided I'd say it was the latter of my statements. 

Go figure I found Steamie Weenie TOTALLY at random, but what a find indeed and by no means does the 5 star even do this place justice! Overall this was just simply perfection from beginning to end! I mean c'mon now see my pictures of how they segregate the bathrooms even (a weenie for the males and buns for the ladies). How can you go wrong?!?

Location wise it is based out of a small, but blossoming strip mall in Henderson and actually was not really much of a drive from the strip as well so certainly something doable. We were coming from the Southern Highland area (near the M casino) and it took roughly about 15 minutes and the restaurant itself was not that difficult to spot, but with a name like Steamie Weenie even in Vegas that tends to stand out? Ha-ha.

From perusing the menu ahead of time it was one of those "has something for every member of the family" type of menus. It had the regular go-to's for the kids, and what certainly made this outing even possible a vegan based hot dog (as I had a member who passed until she heard about the vegan hot dog offering) so definitely even among how it looks on the outside it was quite healthy on the inside.

As for the food, I did find everything to be surprisingly light and I did not feel like I needed to be carted out on a gurney afterwards which is a testament to the attention to health here. I went for the loaded tots as a side and they were prepared to golden brown perfection with a light crisp to it, but absent was the oodles of grease I'm used to getting pretty much everywhere else. Not scrimped on here was the "loaded" portion of the tots. The sour cream was lightly drizzled on the top of mounds of melted cheese, scallions, and the crowd pleasing: bountiful chunks of BACON!  

Now for the main attraction set to knock your tooth out, the trailer park hot dog! There was a lot going on in this dog, but somehow it all comes together and works marvelously. It starts with the great tasting all beef foot long hot dog that had the much sought after snap with each bite (I appreciated that more than anything). From here it was engulfed in piles of crispy fried onion strings, to die for coleslaw that would make the south rise up again, and literal chunks of spam (I think I had the equivalent of maybe two thick slices of it actually). What sets it apart though was for one the beer cheese (and yes there's a difference) and the watermelon BBQ sauce. It had me wanting to shout OH YEEEEEAH like the kool-aid man during each bite!

All in all this place is amazing. We did strike up a conversation with the owners as we walked out and I'm very impressed at how humble they were, but also just the care that they put into what they do. We were treated like family and I really begged them to open up a restaurant in California so I didn't dream of this in between Vegas trips. So definitely when you want a well prepared hot dog don't waste time on the strip and channel your inner dog. Think steamie and even think weenie and trek on over here as you will NOT be disappointed!"}

It was fabulous and worth the 25 minute drive. I'll be back. The reindeer dog had a more subtle reindeer/caribou flavor but I enjoyed it. I think most people would like it whether they like game flavor or not. I want to try the whole menu now. The kids corn dog is massive which was cool because I got to eat what my son couldn't finish.

Order:

Chili Mac Dog: hot dog topped with chili and mac & cheese.  2/5

Corn dog: basic nothing special. 2/5

Baked potato tots: basic nothing special. The beer cheese didn't add any real benefits as far as flavor. If anything melted cheddar would have been a better approach. 2/5"}

For me I'm pretty basic. I tried a dog with some beer cheese and diced onions and tomatoes. It was good but could've been hotter. The cheese and dog were luke warm. Also the dogs are skinny and long. I would also prefer a beefier thicker dog but that's just me. 

My husband loved his Mt. Fuji dog and the Pushcart. He is already making his selections for the next visit. We also got the loaded tots which was amaze balls. I tried the steamie sauce on the side as well. 

Next time I'm gonna try the Mac n cheese dog. So, yes, we will be back!"}

We've been here twice now. Our food was DELICIOUS. Somehow its never the same the second time, but still good. I ordered the jalapeno popper and my gf the Coney Island. Both were prepared quickly and presentation was amazing. They looked picture perfect. This was no McDonalds bait and switch. The Jalapeno Popper tasted exactly like a jalapeno popper and was amazing! My gf said the Coney Island was good. I can usually tell if she likes a menu item by the look on her face, what she says after her first bite, and if she finishes it. The Coney Island looked like a winner. The second time we ordered, the presentation was a a bit messy and the temperature was luke warm. We DID order ahead (maybe this is a factor). But for some reason, crushed expectations changes the flavor :(   Nevertheless we still love this place. 

This is one of the best places to satisfy your gourmet hot dog craving.

I use to hate hog dogs. I remember having to eat those plastic wrapped poisonous wieners from the regular grocery stores when I was younger. There are healthier options now and supposedly not full of whatever they use to stuff in these things...at least I will believe this is true."}

Steamie Weenie is the latest arrival to the culinary category of creatively topped dogs.
There are so many cool dogs to try, some of the classics like the Windy City Chicago dog, the chili- and mustard-topped Coney, and the Carolina Slaw Dog.

Among the goofiest are: The Georgia Scramble, adds a pile of oyster crackers to mustard, ketchup, chili, onions and pickles.
The 9th Island is mountain of fried Spam cubes atop a tangy grilled pineapple relish. 

I've tried a few, my favorite one is Jalapenos Popper Dog. Its loaded Beer and Cream cheese with Jalapenos. (Yum!) See when food tastes good, my rationale tends to fail on me. I thought it would be fun to mix the Yucatan and the Sriracha sauce together for extra kick. Needless to say I caused myself unnecessary pain for being stupid. I still managed to finish it though.

I'm used to mixing my mac&cheese with hot dog meat, so I had to pick the next logical choice the M&C&C, this dog tastes awesome!! It can get really messy if your able to eat it with your hands, I'd suggest eating it with utensils.

The staff are nice people especially Bob (the owner). He cares about the product he puts out and he just wants people to enjoy his food..

Highly recommend!!"}

There's a good crowd there with a mixed lot of families, couples, and people just having a good time. I love the relaxed vibe and the menu. The owner asked if I have been there before and I said it's my first time. He handed me their updated menu so I didn't get mixed up with the menu on the wall. So nice! I ordered the Coney Island Hot Dog (premium Vienna Beef frankfurter, special hot dog chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard) Das Wurst (German-style bratwurst with spicy house mustard and sauerkraut), and Loaded Baked Potato Tots. I thought everything was really tasty, great quality, and the winning touch for me was that buns were steamed!!! It may not be a big deal for some, but to me it elevates the hot dog to something special. Nothing beats warm soft bread with a good hot dog. I would definitely come back to try their other hot dogs and goodies . Also, kudos to their excellent service."}

The employees were very friendly and seemed that they really wanted you there and even did table touches to see if every one was enjoying their food. The atmosphere was great. It was clean and appeared to be new? Very nice.

The bad. Way, way, way over priced!!!. This meal cost 15.48. Being from Chicago no hotdog stand would stay in business charging so much. For a couple of dogs, fries and water should be 6 or 7 dollars at the most. No fountain drinks either. Only fancy high sugar bottles in a cooler to pick from. I chose water because their was no diet selections and was charged 1.25 for a 16oz bottle. The next customer asked for a glass of water and the just gave the water to him without charge. Seemed odd to give to one and charge another?

I won't be back because of the price. 16 for 2 dogs is not what I'm willing to spend on a lunch. But good luck to the owner because the details are good and you can see his heart is in the joint."}

I live right down the street from this establishment and finally decided to give it a try.  I must say that I was not at all disappointed.

For starters, the owners are extremely friendly and welcoming.  Great people with great attitudes are the basis for a great experience.  They knocked it out of the park for me.

The decor is simple and colorful as one would hope/expect out of a hot dog spot.  Seating for about 20-30.  Standard fare aside from the custom painted wall which was a nice touch.

The menu!  I stood there chatting it up because I just couldn't decide what to choose.  All of the options were so creative.  I know I will be back to try several items but, this day, I decided to go with the following...

1 "Trailer Park"
1 side of Mac n Cheese
1 IBC bottled root beer

Total came out to 11.31.  Not the cheapest of meals but this wasn't your ordinary dog and side.  While not any one of the ingredients were outstanding, the combination was very satisfying.  It reminded me of my days as a child while integrating tastes I had acquired as an adult.  Very cool experience.  The mac n cheese was much better than I expected.  Had I not ordered it, I would have been all over a beer cheese option.

All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new and unique when it comes to the classic hot dog.

As a note, the only reason I am not giving a full 5 star rating today is for a couple of reasons.

1) Fountain drinks should be an option for those that want to save a little money.  The bottled selection they offer is great but having options would be nice.

2) The standard franks, while lengthy, aren't very robust.  I picked my dog based on the fact that there was an added protein topper.  Will be trying the hot link or bacon wrapped upgrade next time.

Congrats on the opening!"}

 My son had the mac and cheese dog, he loved it. He also tried the state fair dog (corn dog) and it was so so. Wasn't bad, just wasn't as impressive as the other dogs. Husband had the PBB & JJ, bacon wrapped dog with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly, he loved it. He also got the Carolina, has slaw, watermelon rind bbq sauce and pulled pork, he didn't finish it, he didn't care for it. I think it was a bit bland. I ordered the Maxwell, I chose the hot link, comes with grilled onions, mustard, beer cheese and peppers, so good!! We also had loaded tots and floats. I recommend getting a float, you pick any of the many glass bottles sodas to pair with.

We ordered the Trailer Park dog and the PBB&JJ dog, with sides of onion rings and fries, and two drinks.  Paid almost $20.  The flavor was good, the PBB&JJ was surprisingly delicious and extremely unique.  All served on locally baked hotdog buns, which were fresh and tasty!  The dogs themselves were flavorful and all beef.  We will go back to try more of their creations.

I do have some criticisms that prevent me from giving 5 stars.  (Actually, I'd give this a 3.5 rating because of these criticisms, but I rounded up because I like the dogs.)  For one, I think it is a mistake to upcharge for different styles of hotdog meat.  The menu items themselves are priced high enough that you should have the option to have a local link or an all beef dog or a brat for the same price.  I would love to try the local links but I'm not willing to turn my $7 hotdog into $8.  They only sell bottled beverages, and they add a hefty price to your total bill.  The basic sides, while inexpensive, are not good quality.  The onion rings were obviously frozen battered and the fries were also obviously frozen first."}

I got a plain hot dog, chili-cheese fries, and a bottled root beer for $13.05.  Pretty expensive but it might be worth it if you got one of the more exotic hot dogs. That's the only reason to ever return here, really.  

Peeves: 
1) The majority of my fries were completely raw in the middle.  I'm talkin' crunchy raw potato, folks.  It wasn't pretty.  
2) Cockroach in the corner.  Not a big deal, it can happen to the best of us.  Doesn't mean it's a dirty place.  But sweep it up for crissakes.  
3) The ketchup on the table was empty but the mustard was brand new.  They could have taken two seconds to take the safety seal off the mustard before putting it on the table, but not a big deal, either.

You like a da spicy? You're going to love da Nor'Wester! This... cream cheese, griddled onions, scallions, fresh jalapeño peppers, and Sriracha. It's has a kick trust me, I was sweating while enjoying this bad boy.

My only beef SW are the buns. I'd like a sturdier bun, they tend to fall apart when you're only halfway done eating your weenie. Also, how about buns that match the dog? Order a Nor'Westrer, get it on a jalapeno and cheese bun or an "everything" bun for the Everything Bagel Dog? 

Just a weenie thought for great weenie spot."}

Although the location was a little hidden, I was able to find it and glad I did. There's not much to the place or to the service. It the hotdogs are damn right on. Had the BLT and added mayo and fresh jalapeños. Yum. Then I moved on to the Chicago. Two?  Yes, I was hungry and boy did it satisfy. 

Will be back for more. And more. And more."}

Yes I went there. The name stuck in my head and I am glad it did. The food is delicious and great service. The location is clear from the street and you can't miss it once on green Valley Ranch. We went before closing so it was not busy.
I ordered the salchipappas $5 and it was steamy hot which was perfect for my craving. It's crinkle fries with hot dog pieces and steamie sauce. Yum yum!!
My husband got the baked potato tots $4.75 all I have to say about this is beer and cheddar cheese on top of tots! The little bit he let ke have was delicious. He also got the coney weenie $5.75. Not half bad. He enjoyed it but I'm just not a fan of chili on hot dogs. 
Overall, great experience and I will be back for happy hour for the floats"}

I really like trying new hot dog flavors and The Steamie Weenie does a really good job on putting together different flavor combos together. Be on the lookout for their Specials because it's usually a limited time flavor like for St.Party's Day they had a corned beef hot dog with sauerkraut which was pretty good. The hot dog bun is nicely steamed too and that makes the hot dog experience complete. They also offer craft sodas if you want something cold and bubbly to go with your meal. The sides are all comfort goodness. I really like the loaded tater tots. It comes with bacon pieces, sour cream, and sliced green onions.  

Service is always professional and down to earth. It's a mom and pop shop and they make the effort to make you feel welcomed and are grateful for your business. They take the time and care to put the food together from prepping to presentation. Even on the to go orders! The food is never hastily thrown in a box or smashed together no matter how busy they get. As simple as a hot dog may seem, the fact that the workers care about how you get the food when you get home says a lot about the pride they take on their food and service. Definitely give this place a try."}

Me being from Tucson was excited to see they have a dog on the menu call "The Tucson" basically their take on an Sonoran dog.

Okay, all jokes aside, my bf and I wanted to eat something to hold us over until dinner and didn't want to be too full so we ordered the Windy City with a vegan frankfurter and a side of tots which we shared. They were nice enough to offer cutting the weenie in half for us. Toppings were yummy and I was no longer hangry. We also picked up a unique Pumpkin flavored soda from their collection of sodas which was delicious! 

Their menu does offer different variations of the hotdog, all of which sound amazing. I'd come back again for another quickie to try a  build your own with some different toppings. 

They're very friendly. They asked how the meal was a few bites in  and if everything was okay. Even wished us a good day our way out."}

We were pleasantly surprised that they offered vegan dogs ($0.99 extra), but even more surprised by how yummy their hotdogs were!  And not too heavy on the stomach, either.

Our typical orders are:  Mac & Cheese, Jalapeno Popper, and Mt. Fuji all with vegan dogs.

Perhaps a spicy red salsa would be much better. It had plenty of beans. 

The loaded potato tots were better than the dog, for me, and they were a pile of greasy goodness! The tots have lots of bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream and all the flavor! I hope the other 3 kinds of tots on the menu are this good! You can make a meal out of this dish for sure."}

This is not the normal hot dogs u get at the grocery store for 3.99....these are real genuine quality hot dogs!

And if you've never had a quality hot dog before the Steamie Weenie....you have been missing out!!  There are quality hot dogs out there and please don't expect to pay what u pay for hot dogs at the grocery store.

You pay for what u get. :) and for me...Steamie Weenie was absolutely worth every penny. I can't wait to go back!! :)

Now enough of my vent....:)

I went with my bf and we ended up getting 3 hot dogs and an order of tater tots with chili and cheese.  Let me tell u...the tots were for real. Crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside like any good tater tot should be. :)

My bf had the Coney Style....And he absolutely loved it!!!

I was the little porker and had the Mt. Fuji and the bratwurst special. :)

Let me begin the review for the hot dogs and say....WOW....the buns were freaking amazing!!! :)  They were soft and almost just melted in your mouth. :)

The Mt. Fuji came with teriyaki onions, green onions, carrots and wasabi mayo....let's just say it was bomb. The carrots gave it that nice crunch and the onions a nice little bit of sweetness and the vienna hot dog had the best snap and alot of flavor without all that saltiness that I get with regular hot dogs. And of course I can't forget the nori....:) it added just a little without overpowering the entire dish for that umami flavor. :)

And what can I say about the bratwurst....it was delicious. Had just the right amount of mustard and sauerkraut for that perfect bite. :)

And if u love spicy food like I love spicy food....get their Habanero sauce. Omg....it added so much flavor and a nice but of heat.....soooooo good!!!

And if u ask nicely....they'll even sell u a bottle....:)

I can't wait to go back and try their other hot dogs...yum yum yum....:)"}

Not so busy during the week to get a quick bite for lunch.. But I wouldnt be surprise if they will be soon

Staff are great and explained the different types of hotdogs they got to offer... 

Parking is limited as there are other places to eat in the area.. 

Something about their hotdog buns that makes the meal truly amazing! The hotdog was very tasty and the awesome toppings they offer works very well!! 

Windy City and Tucson are my top picks!! 

Will be back for sure to try the others..

ENJOY!"}

I always get that salchipapas when I go here, which is right under $5 and a good portion of crinkle cut fries drizzled with fry sauce, topped with cheese and their all beef hot dog pieces. YUM! The owners are a really nice couple and make you feel welcomed. Definitely a great spot for a lunch break and who knows, maybe next time I might actually get a dog."}

I went to the Restaurant on FRIDAY MARCH 3, 2017 to pick up an order. I walked in the Restaurant to ask for an order I was picking up and the gentleman at the counter (NO NAME TAG) was very vulgarer with me and used some foul language at me. I tried to explain to him about my order and he proceeded to keep interrupting me. 

I recently placed my own order to just try the food here to have a better FOOD review as well. The hot dogs are just like any other ones you would get elsewhere, but just really was not what I expected. I have a regular place I usually go to but thought I would try this place, not somewhere I would return to or order from again.

1. Food not the best for the quality I look for
2. The presentation is horrible
3. Customer Service is not the best"}

I never would have guessed it would be for hot dogs, but Steamie Weenie is definately worthy enough! 

Once again, thanks to Yelp, I found this new business just off the 215 and Green Valley Parkway in the Pebble marketplace. Steamie weenie is a locally owned business which I always try and support. It is decorated simple yet fun with dark wood floors and "Steamie weenie" spray painted on the wall. They offer not only gourmet hot dogs with interesting combinations of flavors but several sides as well as the coolest bottled soda collection I have seen. 

We were welcomed immediately as we walked in. They were happy to offer suggestions as it was our fist time. I went with the Carolina slaw dog and a side of tots. The Carolina dog has coleslaw, pulled pork, diced onions and their famous watermelon rind bbq sauce which is excellent. Everything went together really well. My only minor complaint was that I thought the actual hot dog got a little lost as it was on the smaller side. The tots were good but could have been crispier. 

I will definately be returning to try several other things on the menu such as the trailer park dog, onion rings, the mac n cheese and that pumpkin pie soda I saw. If your in the mood for a dog this is the place to go."}

I rank it as one of the worst parking lots in the valley.  I have always dreaded pulling into it's maze of parking barriers, funky travel lanes occupied by crabby angry people wanting to play bumper cars with you.  We were in Hendo recently and in need of sustenance.  Despite the heinous parking lot, PM is filled with little gems.  I rolled into the parking lot and assumed the form of water traveling all the paths of least resistance until I found a spot on the north end.

Still not sure where to dine, we spied Steamie Weenie.  I had seen it was trending on yelp and with that developed a hankering for a hot dog.  I pitched the idea to the GF and did some quick research on yelp to see if they had a turkey dog or something similar to sweeten the proposition.  She agreed to visit with the promise of a vegan frankfurter.  

We entered and were greeted by Bob, the owner.  He happily explained the menu.  I spotted the Nor'Wester.  It consisted of cream cheese, grilled onions, jalapeños, scallions and siracha.  I asked if I could swap the regular dog for one wrapped in bacon.  Not a problem.  The crunch of bacon with the cream cheese was an awesome combination.  The bun was moist and very soft.

The GF got a Mac & Cheese dog with a vegan frank.  The Boy got something off the menu that was spicy with some fries on the side.  

There is no soda machine.  You do however, have your choice of an assortment of bottled traditional and novelty sodas.

When I am on this side of the valley again, I would absolutely look Steamie Weenie up again!"}

My husband has been raving about this spot for awhile now, but hotdogs are not my favorite so I didn't rush over. Imagine my surprise when I started reading articles about how great this place is and it started to sound like something special.

The restaurant is decorated very cute for a hot dog place. The weenie on the wall is adorable. Most of the tables are high top tables, but some of the chairs have backs. A place to hang my purse! This excites me more than it should because normally I hate tall tables. 

Both of the people working were really friendly. I could tell they want to be successful and appreciate their customers. 

I had the Windy City dog. The hotdog was larger than the standard hot dog and delicious. The toppings were plentiful and tasty. The ingredients seemed fresh and better than what I expected from a hot dog place. For example, the diced tomatoes were definitely fresh and not from a can. 

My husband had the Tucson and Georgia Scramble. I tasted these and loved them. As with my dog the toppings were plentiful and fresh. The Tucson starts with a bacon wrapped dog so you can't go wrong with that.

We split the Tot Chos which was like a frito pie (sub tots for fritos). So good! Hopefully I'm not giving them too much credit, but the chili seemed homemade or they chose good chili because I loved it. It wasn't like the canned chili my husband sneaks into the house. 

I'm already getting hungry for my next visit from writing this. I can't wait to come back."}

The PBB&JJ is a bacon wrapped hot dog, peanut butter, and jalapeno jelly. Great combination of sweet and savory. Probably the tastiest and most creative hot dog I've ever had.

For a side, I had the Tot-Chos, which are tater tots with shredded cheddar cheese, chili, sour cream, jalapenos, and tomatoes. Like nachos, but replace the chips with tater tots. More of a traditional and familiar side order flavor profile. Also delicious.

This doesn't get five stars because of price. The PBB&JJ was $6.29 and the Tot-Chos were $4.59. For about $12 after tax, it was definitely a delicious meal, but I was still hungry. I'm not expecting it to compete with Costco on hot dog pricing, but I would've had to order another hot dog to be satisfied, theoretically pushing the meal to the $20 range. It doesn't feel right to be at that price point for hot dogs."}

We had tried their PB and Jelly Dog at a Yelp event, it was very interesting and wanted to try more. We were in the area after a hike so we gave them a try. 
 These were OK, just nothing special, have had better. We got a Chili Cheese , the Tuscon, and the Trailer Park.  We also got a side of Tator Tots to share which I really liked, they made them nice and crispy, not greasy. Used some fry sauce for dipping, I'd go back for Tots. They have a selection of odd flavored sodas which is fun, had a vanilla root beer. 
Staff was friendly and got our food order fast and correct. The place was clean. Prices are on par with other fancy hot dog places."}

I had the Pushcart Hot Dog  which was very good and the ends extended over the bun and had a nice crunch on the ends. I had the loaded baked potato tots which were good too. No soda fountain, bottle soda and water only  and kinda expensive for a hot dog but I will be back!"}

I remembered I had heard about this place & we decided to give it a try.  My husband ordered a rather boring Maxwell Street hot link, which he said was really good.  I wanted to be a little more adventurous, so I got a bacon wrapped jalapeño popper dog.  It was really tasty!  I loved the flavor of the beer cheese on it.  We also split a mac & cheese & cheese dog which was yummy as well, next time I might add grilled onions to it, though.  Shared an ordered of pickle fries, too -- the best I've ever had, I was confused at first 'cuz I'd only ever had sliced fried pickles & these looked like fries.  The ranch we had to dip them in was perfect.
This place isn't close to our house, but we'll be heading back there soon 'cuz there are several other weenies I want to try.
Oh, the only thing I didn't like was the lack of fountain drinks.  My root beer was really good, but overpriced.  I was still thirsty, but didn't want to pay another $2.50 for a second drink.  That made it a 4 star review for me."}

My first visit was to do a little hot dog recon (military vet here!), purchasing four different hot dogs to take back to a gathering for...taste examination:
BLT dog, Carolina Slaw dog, Mac n' Cheese dog, and Windy City dog. The outcome:
Mac n' Cheese got thumbs up!
BLT got thumbs up!
Carolina Slaw got thumbs up!
Windy City...got thumbs tentatively up (the neon green relish combined with the peppers,
     not so much, but the overall taste, good). If you are not a fan of the peppers, just leave 
     those off!

Yes, all their drinks are bottled, so if having the fountain type drink is your thing, you can STILL have a GREAT hot dog, tots (even specialty tots!), root beer float.  If you would prefer, you can bring your fountain soda in with you. Seriously, even checked with the owner and he was cool with that. Now, they have over 24 types of bottled sodas (including the line of Fanta's!!!!), bottled lemonade, tea, and bottled water. If you have children who may not be able to handle a glass bottle, they have cups behind the counter.

I'm not sure where the idea of the menu being painted on the wall was seen. When you walk in the door, if you turn to your left there is a large, framed area where the menu has been printed by category. If you want to see an individual one, they are right there to the left of the register. When they are really busy (I was there this past Saturday and wow....lots of people!!!!), you may want to just ask for a menu so you can be looking over your choices while you are waiting to order. That might be something to consider...having an employee zip around out there when they are really really busy and thank folks for coming, hand them a menu so they can connect before they get to the register. 

Today was my third Carolina Slaw dog in.....I really shouldn't admit to this....about 10 days. I know, I know.....I'm going to turn into a hot dog! But hey, what a way to go!!!!

In terms of price, you will pay essentially what you pay when you go through that fast food drive thru. Seriously...by the time you order one of those numbered selections and respond "yes" to making it a large and add tax, it is about the same give or take a dollar or two. The hot dogs and toppings are a great size/helping and I can't imagine going away hungry....unless you were nice enough to share yours with someone so you didn't get the whole thing!!!!

Today was yes, the Carolina Slaw dog, a root beer float (I chose O-So Butterscotch Root Beer for mine), a side of tots, and a bottled soda. The atmosphere is indigenous to the type of business it is. Picture yourself at a hot dog stand on a busy street in New York City. You walk up to the vendor, order your dog, and you stand there eating it....you might see folks juggling a soda or maybe they found a bench nearby and sat down. It's exactly what I would expect...stand around a high table and enjoy....sit on one of the stools available at the tables. There are two regular height tables with chairs as well. The restaurant is ADA compliant in terms of access for wheelchairs, motorized chairs, etc. If you were to come in and need one of the two regular tables and they were taken, I can't begin to imagine that someone wouldn't move to make it available for you. :-)

Long review, but getting into this marketplace with all the other food establishments must be a challenge. I say....if you haven't tried one, c'mon......give it a try!!!!! YUM!"}

We tried Buldogis before so we figure the name here caught our attention and boy was this place a hidden gem pretty much. The flavors on the dogs we got mixed so well and nothing overpowered the other. I would even go ahead and say this place is better than buldogis just simply because the preparation and portion size is on point.

I got the Carolina which has pulled pork, slaw and an in house made watermelon bbq sauce. This one was not over sauced like some places that smother the pulled pork in sauce, the slaw was very good and not watery at all, plus they used a Nathan's all beef dog and a soft bun to compliment the ingredients.

My wife ended up getting the BLT and damn that was good too. There was just the right amount of toppings in this with a nice bacon wrapped Nathan's dog fried nicely. The last thing we got for ourselves was the loaded baked tots, it wasn't overly cheesy or heavy after eating any of this. We could do our hike afterward without the bloated feeling like some hot dog spots give you."}

I stuck with the classic Cheese Chili Cheese dog with added diced onions and jalapeños. It was good, nothing extraordinary. Tasted like a chili cheese dog.

After trying my boyfriend's hotdog, that he custom made, I wished I had done that too. So he got the Vienna dog wrapped in bacon with spicy mustard, mayo, diced onions, scallions, jalapeños, and sauerkraut. It was a beauty and the flavors exploded in my mouth. It was so good that I think they should make this a staple on their menu.

Overall, I will probably be back. But it's not cheap. The two hotdogs with one side of tater tots and 2 drinks set us back $20."}

I would have liked to get a cup of water and keep refilling it because I was thirst and can't afford to pay $3-4 every time I want to buy another drink. Also, I HIGHLY suggest a glass recycling bin for all those soda bottles. I came with friends and we went through 9 glass bottles of sodas in our one visit and they all went in the regular trash. All those glass bottles not being recycled everyday? Just my two cents :) give this place a try! SO many non-plain Jane options. You won't be disappointed :)"}

Great little spot for a dog! Their Windy City doesn't disappoint - even if they use dill spears instead of cucumber slices and no poppy-seed bun.
 On the "new tricks" part of the menu you gotta try the PBB&JJ. Peanut butter & jalapeno jelly on a bacon wrapped dog. On paper it sounds a little weird, but trust me - it is amazing! The jalapeno jelly isn't too hot & it  really is the perfect salty, sweet, savory, & smokey balance.  
  The Carolina  (pulled pork & coleslaw topped dog) was tasty, too. There are several ways to top fries or tots and a wide variety of bottled sodas are on hand. Stop in & say "hi" to Bob & he'll help you pick your favorite."}

I love hot dogs so I decided to stop in and see what it was all about, especially with a name like Steemie Weenie lol. They have so many options, from classics to crazy new twists that look delicious as well. I decided to create my own dog which had: cream cheese, grilled pineapple relish, jalapeño jelly and fried onions. The sweet woman working there who I think is also the owner recommended I throw a little sirracha on top and... hot diggity dog!!!! It was the most amazing hot dog I have ever had. The dog itself was cooked to perfection. I wish I would have ordered two to be honest lol. I really loved the unique options they had to offer, and I am so happy I found this place because otherwise I would have never known you can do so much more with a hotdog than ketchup and relish!! They also have a whole fridge full of vintage sodas only in glass bottles. Will definitely be back!!!"}

Peanut butter and jalapeño jelly... Genius! 
My wife had a chilly cheese hot dog very good!! And the loaded tots are great and plenty for two to share. 
The vintage drink bottle selection they have is a lot of fun... I can't remember the last time I had a great cream soda out of a glass bottle...

I have lived here since 2006 and I have been going here from the very beginning. They have all you can eat like every other place (they say they will charge you if you don't finish, but I have never had this happen).

This is not a place to go if you are not into a laid back environment as it is more of a family/friends place. The servers are great and leave you to your meal but the space is so small it is extremely easy to flag them down when you need something. 

My only complaint and I always tell the manager is that they used to make their cucumber salad with shredded cucumbers but they have since changed to chopping them. It just doesn't taste the same, everything else however I love. I will continue to go here until I move from NV or they close their doors."}

Yes, I eat a lot of sushi. Yes, the sushi here is good. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat for $21.95... For that, you would think there would be more stars, BUT READ THE FINE PRINT... 

YOU GET CHARGED FOR WHAT YOU DON'T EAT, INCLUDING THE EXTRA BITS OF RICE LEFT BEHIND.

I can understand that if you order like 8 rolls and leave several pieces from each, it's a waste, but that was NOT the case for us. Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of $ from us. What we didn't appreciate is that EVERY TIME the guy came to our table he would warn us that we HAD to finish EVERYTHING. "We charge extra for leftovers," or, "We charge extra for uneaten rice," or, "I told you we charge extra, right?" 

The worst part was, if he wasn't at our table warning us, he never stopped staring at us. He would stand at his podium and WATCH us eat. Then he'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in Japanese. Specifically, he kept his eyes on me and it made me lose my appetite. He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me. 

I'm a laid-back person and I'm generous with my reviews, but this was, by far, my WORST sushi experience. I will not be back."}

Asked for more Wasabi more than once. Didn't clear dishes until the end. Surprised by 18% gratuity on our party of 5+. They are very friendly when you leave."}

We decided to try this place because we felt the need to spice up our Sushi schedule. We have three places that we alternate between and it was just time to switch things up!

I am going to warn you that when you pull in here and walk up your first instinct is going to be to turn right back around and walk back to your car. Ignore this feeling, I promise you the looks are decieving. It is a very, very tiny space probably has five tables and the bar, but I am telling you the rolls are amazing and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming!

We opted for AYCE, obviously. 

Our rolls we tried:

Screaming Orgasm
Nevada
Dragon
American
Baked Salmon
Baked Wet Dream
Tako (Octopus) Nigiri
Dynamite

We also had Garlic Edamame, Seaweed Salad, and of course Tempura Ice Cream for dessert!

I cannot wait to come back again, and again, and again!"}

We were talking about AYCE sushi places in Vegas, and he swears by Sushi Bay. I was curious because the last few places that I had tried hadn't blown me away in any sort of way. Even though I had passed by this restaurant probably a million times, for some reason, I have never gone in. Now, my thoughts have changed, and I am a Sushi Bay believer.

I've tried a little bit of everything on the menu. Rather than talk about each individual thing, I'll just give you the gist. There have only been two places that I have been too where all the fish and seafood from start to finish has been completely fresh. Number 1 is Goyemon. Number 2 is Sushi Bay. All the nigiri was very fresh across the board, no weird off flavors or textures. The rice was very good as well, just the right texture and temperature. I liked all the apps as well, they were simple but well prepared. If you do go there, I would also recommend trying out the Cherry Blossom, a marvel of avocado, crab, and goodness. They also have yaki-udon, which I haven't seen on a lot of AYCE sushi menus, and it tasted good. The only minor complaint was I thought the salmon skin was a bit too chewy for my taste, but nothing to take a star off or anything. The server was nice and attentive, and the sushi chef was friendly.

This place was very suprising. I've recently heard that Goyemon has changed a lot since my last visit, with a major turnover in staff, so this will probably be my go-to AYCE sushi spot in Vegas. Everything across the board was very good. From top to bottom, I can't find any major complaints about this place."}

Atmosphere was cute, decorated with traditional Japanese decor like in Japan, felt comfy. Waitress was really nice and friendly and took our order right away, never asked
For anything, all refills kept on coming along with napkins. Hubby and I got the all you can eat which was $23 dinner, and for lunch I believe it's $19, by far the cheapest sushi bar I've been to! 

All you can eat menu had a large variety of different kind of sushi, including specialty sushi, baked sushi and deep fried. My absolute favorite was the "Sushi Bay" roll. It's a must to try that. Also the "Super White Tuna" so fresh and creamy. 

I will most definitely come back for more. Give this place a try, I guarantee you'll leave happy and satisfied and possibly full."}

Flow of dishes was good. Seemed that chef went heavy on the rice for Nigiri; which is not a deal breaker for AYCE. However, I noticed something really odd with the Fried Scallop. The scallops tasted off and looked like imitation crap meat. When i sent it back, staff confirmed that it was indeed deep fried imitation crab. That is very sheisty to mislead the customers and serve fake food. Makes me question about where else are they cutting corners? Hence 1 start rating."}

My meal was very high and consistent quality. Especially impressive were the little things. Rice, so often overlooked, was high quality and done to perfection. The miso soup was homemade, fresh and light. One of the best I've had in years.

It's a really small place. Maybe 6 tables and a sushi bar. My husband and I sat at the bar and went with all you can't eat. For dinner it is only $25 a person! Half a roll ranges from $6-$9 so if you're going to eat a decent amount, AYCE is the way to go. That is such a great deal so right away I was thinking this food is going to suck. I'm happy to report it as pleasantly surprised! 

The food did not take very long at all, especially since we were at the bar so the sushi chefs just handed the food to us as they made it. I highly recommend anything fried - tempura, sandwich roll, etc. That was by far my favorite. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the best sushi or freshest I've had, but the price and customer service was excellent."}

The sushi culture has become so main stream and expensive that its just gotten ridiculous. When I eat sushi I want good rolls and fresh fish. I seem to end up going to places where things are average but the prices are ludicrous. Those places usually have the staff dressed up as Geishas and something in a traditional Japanese gi like a scene from enter the dragon. This place not so much. 

It's small and never really crowded. Some people may look at it and wonder why but to me it means that they don't need smoke and mirrors to entertain would be customers. I dig sitting at the bar. The chefs will put on anything on the TV. It's a plus during baseball season because you can stuff your face for 9 innings while catching a game. Everything is good. I've yet to have something I wasn't a fan of. Then again if your a sushi person your probably down to try anything. My advice drop in with an appetite its worth the price."}

The rolls have become a gastronomic nightmare , I came for nigiri and sushi not rice , if I wanted rice I'd go to vons next door and buy a bag for 3.50 and save the hassle of going to sushi bay. Their uni is from what I could decipher a relic , it deserved to be in a museum it was that old , it was brown and smelled like a hobo that lives at the local warf. Their eel is never cooked proparlly its not crispy and hot like eel should be , it came out luke warm like it was shoved in between someones armpit and slopped on the heaping roll of rice. Sushi bay you have failed me for the last time."}

Henderson is littered with sushi places but the good ones never offered AYCE. I understand that but sometimes I'm just in the mood to OD on sushi. 

Years ago they was offering a special for that time being of AYCE sushi lunch for $18.95. We took a chance since we didn't find any good AYCE sushi nearby. This place is literally a hole in the wall, being in the vicinity of a grocery store and surrounded by fast food joints such as Taco Bell & Dairy Queen. Don't let that stop you from visiting. What it lacks in trendy decor, they make it up with a good variety of sushi.

I always take and suggest Sushi Bay for guests looking for AYCE sushi. It's not expensive and the variety will make anyone happy. My sister is a diabetic and they offer enough riceless sushi for her and for anyone looking to cut down on carbs. Sushi is never formed with too much rice (like some other AYCE sushi places) and when I mean variety I mean the sushi isn't replaced with 1 ingredient  and is renamed. 

I always coming when the "rush hour" is over for AYCE sushi. If it's too busy you can eat at the bar. I recently ate here for their lunch special too. Their lunch special isn't anything special but is priced for a quick healthy lunch. Some reviews complain about the host/hostess and to be honest perhaps they don't want to talk so much because maybe their english isn't perfect. Who cares though? I'm not paying to talk to them. 

Will be coming back in the future just as long as they keep up the good work."}

I've been here before and liked the food.  It was close so we said why not?!

It's a hole in the wall type place on the corner of Pecos and Warm Springs.  Not very many seating, however, every time I've visited the location, I've always been seated right away.  Because of the small floor, they usually have only one server at a time.  If there are big parties, it can take a while before they come to your table.  

We usually get the same thing:  All you can eat for $23.95 per person.  Can I just say how wonderful of an idea that is!!  You get an entire menu, front and back to choose from.  I usually go for the side orders and if any sushi, from the Nigiri section I strongly feel getting your money's worth is important.  I don't ever want to be weighed down by lots of rice.  Here's somethings I love from the menu:

Shrimp Tempura:  batter is light and super crispy.  The dipping sauce is lightly salted and sweet at the same time.  Works well with the shrimp.

Teriyaki chicken:  comes in a cast iron mini skillet sizzling!  It sits on a best of sliced onions and Teriyaki sauce.  Love!

Bacon Wrapped Scallops:  Small little bite sizes of mini scallops and salty bacon.  Yum!

Sweet Amaebi Shrimp nigiri sushi:  Comes with 2 per order, per customer.  The shrimp is sweet.  Works well as a bite sized sushi piece.  This dish is served with the deep fried heads as well.  That was a huge surprise, not into eating shrimp heads so I was kind of grossed out LOL.

Soft Shell Crab:  The whole crab, battered, deep fried and cut into 4 huge pieces.  You can eat the whole crab.  The tangy and lightly spicy dipping sauce really works well.

Fried Gyoza:  Pork filled fried dumpling with a great soy dipping sauce.  

Hamachi Nigiri:  Love this white yellowtail sushi option.  Not too much of a fishy taste to it.  Really good!

If you're ever in the area, come down and get your sushi fix on.  Overall, this place is actually pretty good.  I would definitely come back and get the All You Can Eat option!!"}

Food is good, the chef is always friendly and welcoming. Just two things that i dont like is. 1. I went there with my family and my 2 year old he doesnt eat much. They charged me half price for giving him a handful of rice and a couple bites of seaweed salad? I know your not supposed to share but i dont think this is right. And second, i went another time and the total of my bill was around $90 , the waiters were making a big deal cause i left them a small tip. I can tip whatever i want. If you do a good service ill tip you right, if I constantly have to be calling you for things your tip goes down or maybe not even get a tip. Wen they saw how much i tipped them i heard them say. "Wow really only $10""}

Everyone looked pissed. NO ONE welcomed us or made eye contacts for good 2 minutes (out of one waitress and the two sushi men). They just glanced blankly at our direction. I felt awkwarded out by the silence. 

The waitress (older Korean woman) pointed to a table so we sat there. We ordered something a la carte and two waters and the waitress gave us a weird vibe like she was pissed. The entire meal, she didnt come along to check on us or give us refills. She at one point got cranky with a couple that came in so they actually walked out. When they walked out, she blurted something out to the sushi men. Let's just say i know their language pretty well.....n what she said was not nice. I have  gone there a couple times n they actually talk smack a lot about their customers. Some customers seem like they come there a lot based on what i hear from the conversation. What disloyal people?? It made me mad. 

I felt uncomfortable the entire time. Maybe i should have gone elsewhere when i first felt the weird vibe when i walked in. Another family walked in and out too during our meal. It was really weird there. I would not go back."}

We started with house salad, poke salad and a crazy jalapeno. Everything was seasoned well and plated with finesse. From there we ordered Valley of fire, 911, ichiban, Hawaiian, cherry blossom, and sandwich rolls. Every single roll was made with care and true passion, it showed in every bite.

The restaurant is super small maybe too many tables idk not sure but it felt really small, maybe need to rearrange the layout that might help. 

I went to go sit at the bar and asked if they had a lunch menu and sure enough they did!  Better yet they had lunch specials. They have an excellent variety of specials such as bento boxes,  chef's pick of sushi , and a poke lunch special which are all in between $10 to $12 dollars . Also they do have an all you can eat (A.Y.C.E) option as well. Or you can order al a carte. 

I chose the the salmon bento box lunch special which was $11.50 I believe I could be wrong but either way it was amazing salmon was moist , the tempura was tasty. And the miso soup helped to wash it all down. I also had a spicy tuna nigiri and the sushi chief hooked it up ! Lol 

My overall experience was excellent, the employees were super friendly even the sushi chief was nice ! They play good music have excellent variety of rolls if your ever in area I suggest sushi bay ! I do recommend Go Go Go!!!"}

We brought our 7 month old and 3 year old with us and the wait staff was very welcoming to both kids. 

The sushi was so fresh and quick to be delivered to us. We were greeted immediately upon arrival and when we left. We got the all you can eat for $23.95 for dinner and it was so worth it. All of are food was delivered fast but evenly spaced out so we didn't have too much on the table at once. They also give you the option on the all you can eat menu for half/full or hand roll so my husband and I got to try more. I wasn't a huge fan of the batter they use to fry the soft shell crab/rolls in but everything else I got was delicious.

Since their AYCE menu is so vast I've tried everything I've dared to eat and have not been disappointed. Their poke bowls are on point.

Great staff.  The sushi chefs are friendly and funny.  Always good to have a chat with some good peeps while downing some raw fishes.

On to the sushi....Paradise roll..it's like a redneck of sushi rolls but it is damn delicious. .. shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado with their spicy yum sauce and coconut flakes. My personal favorite is Romeo...it's a less hectic and more spicy take on the Paradise roll. There are so many different choice and variations of sushi on the menu. The fish is relatively fresh and the prices are reasonable, although by no means cheap. Paradise roll is $11.50 I believe, making it the most expensive roll on the menu. The chefs are also accommodating...if you ask them to recreate a roll you like from elsewhere, they will do it.

Ice cold beer, hot tea, cold sushi, hot soup. Their "chef sushi special" was fun; I can't eat a lot of "all you can eat", but this was perfect for a sushi noob. It was a nice "safe" California roll that I could go to between bites of "surprise" rolls.

This was pretty much perfect for me since I've only had sushi about 10 times so far after deciding I like it as an adult. So if you ask me what I like...I couldn't tell you. "the brown ones with the little red specks" or "the pink with the green and yellow" are typical answers I might give you. So I really enjoyed this for exploring.

The place is affordable and low-key. Nice place for lunch and nice place for a chill beer and sushi after work. 

I've never felt belchy or gross after eating here 3 times (and none of those times having any idea what the hell I was eating) which is a pretty good mark for me. I'll probably definitely go back when I want some cheap good sushi."}

OK!  If you are going for all you can eat sushi, then this probably means  you like the complicated so many flavor and stuff type of sushi. In this case, this place is just fine and you cannot go wrong.

1.  For a lunch place, it is perfect. Just the right size, not too crowded and roomy.

2.  Parking - Easy Strip Mall Parking.

3.  Car Wash - No, just kidding, but hey, you can drop your car off at the Chevron across the street , have it washed and enjoy a good sushi meal.

3.  Pricing - Just right at 21.99 all you can eat.

4.  Quality - No bad!  Now I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and prefer the basic Nigiri Sushi style with the seafood on top of rice.  However, I can and will enjoy the American invented sushi rolls and here they are tasty and inventive.  the Screaming Orgasm is very tasty and different!  I enjoyed everything that we ordered!

5.  Service - Just right amount of service. Just right amount of help!

Side note, being of asian persuasion, I am quite sensitive to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The ole adage is that if the bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is clean, the food is bad.  Well, here,the bathroom is quite good and the food is good. So, it is a Win-Win!!!

Check it out."}

Frankly I'm glad it did because I like this place much better. 
We usually go for the ayce. We have so may favorite rolls that we order. One of the things we order is the salmon nigiri. It's a large price of fish on rice. Most places it's the opposite, big piece rice with a small piece of fish on top.
Lately I've been wanting to eat less rice so I'll order the johnny roll and the seafood salad. My other favorite is the tuna hand rolls. One of the things I loved about this place when I fist started coming here was that you can get half rolls for ayce. I mean how great is that?! You can try stuff you've never had before and if you don't like it you're not stuck with a whole roll to force down and if you just like variety you can get more without filling up to fast. I love this place."}

1. The variety - So many sushi restaurants just don't have that much variety. So many places have like 20 rolls to choose from and that's it. This place has at least 50! at least...
2. The imagination - There are so many combonations of veggies, rice, and fish. Other places have the same ol' rainbow roll or unagi with avocado roll. This place has amazing combos. the Dynomite is amazing! I've never heard of this anywhere! (The name may be the same but the actual roll is completely unique)
3. It's delicious - I haven't met a roll here that I though, ick or Meh.  I've been places and ordered the Spider roll (see the same ol same ol) and it be kinda gross like it was sitting there for a day. But not here, the food is all tasty!
4. It's not expensive - It's pretty reasonable! even the fancy rolls aren't expensive.
5. Pleasent atmosphere - this is where I would go for lunch with friends, not dinner with a hot new date and a Vegas show.
All in all, this place is AMAZING!!!"}

I have been going to this joint for 3 years now...3 years people....in Vegas that is a life time. You have to remember if a restaurant sucks it'll shut, especially sushi bars. 

This is a great mum and dad style place, it can seat up to maybe 30 people, so make sure you get there early for lunch as it totally fills up.

The chefs always welcome everyone through the door with a loud "Irashaimasu", which is always a bit of a shock especially if you are in the middle of a conversation, and of course everyone in the restaurant swivel in their seats to see the new arrivals; and after the usual "hello" back from the patrons, everyone one turns back to their yummy sushi.

And finally in my long winded and slightly off track way we get back to the food.....oh dear god....if i had to pick something to eat for the rest of my life it would be their spicy tuna rolls...they are sooooooo good! All of the rolls are beautifully made and presented, the fish is always super fresh and if you get a seat at the bar the chefs will show you all the different uncooked wobbly bits of fish that they use in their creations.

They have the usual sushi and sashimi fare which are all totally excellent, but they have a "special" menu including the fabled "touchdown" rolls (if i told you what was in it, i would have to kill you!) and for those on an low carb diet, rice free sushi!!! Amazing!

What else can i say about Sushi Bay? The hot green tea, is fresh and constantly refilled by the super attentive waitstaff and the Edaname is fab with just the right amount of sea salt.

Go try it....I've eaten in many different sushi restaurants in Vegas and this place is defiantly the best. Great food, great atmosphere, great staff and all for a great price!"}

I asked the other chef ( who goes by Jay and is a wonderful guy) if the other one doesn't like me.  He obviously wanted to save face and said "he's just busy".

The sushi is great , but the waitress isn't the nicest. We would spend 200 to 300 a month at this place. Because me and my boyfriend love the sushi here. We will not be going back after last nights experience. We go here often, but havent tipped much because of the rude waitress. A few weeks ago we ate here, and my bf had a small sip of my coke. He didn't order coke though and the waitress snapped down his throat telling him he couldn't sip my coke... I understand about non all you can eaters eating all you can eat. I know that is not allowed. But it was a soda... like one dollar soda, and he only had a small sip... She scared us so bad yelling at us. If she would of said nicely. He can't drink your coke that would of been fine... So we were like woah...that was bad.... But we gave it one more shot and ate here again thinking maybe she had a bad day or something.  Well as soon as I sat down. The waitress confronted me yesterday and flat out asked me " Why don't you tip more?" I was like woah... I told her the food is great thats not the problem. She said I notice you come here ALOT and don't tip a lot. Then she told me basically I couldn't eat there anymore unless I tipped more. I was like WOW never in my life has that happened anywhere I have ate at. She said and your bf or whatever never tips either. I was like wow so insulting! Then I decided to stay and eat. She was like oh so you decided to stay? I felt horrible!! I stayed and ate and even tipped 7 dollars but  I won't be going back. I am now going to eat at sin city sushi. It is such a shame because we were loyal customers who brought friends often. We were probably most of their business. Oh well...."}

Also to the start of the evening we let the waitress know we've never been there and  asked how it all worked.  She gave a mediocre explanation and didn't whip out the lotto pencil to check off the item you want.  After coming back a second time asking if we've decided I said yes. And told her what we wanted she rolled her eye's and took the mini pencil out of the bottom of the sugar box. I'm not psychic!

The friendly head sushi chef recommended the paradise roll and it truely was one of my favorite sushi roll ever. It had a coconut shrimp with shreaded coconut on top. I'm normally not a fan of coconut but it went really well with the roll. 

I alway base my rating on the nigiri's and I must say, they were nice and thick with little rice. I can eat the salmon all day. Definitely get your money's worth here. The server was extremly nice, always checked on me if everything was o.k. and refilled my drinks promptly.

The menu is awesome. Of the appetizers, you can't go wrong with snow crab or shrimp tempura, and I'd especially recommend the bacon wrapped asparagus.. It's phenomenal. Favorite roll is the paradise roll  -shrimp tempura with spicy sauce and ccoconut  - SO AMAZING. Other standouts are the ichiban roll (with lobster), the Johnny roll (I forget what's in it but it's wrapped in cucumber and it's awesome lots more great rolls but those are our faves. They even had our favorite Korean blackberry wine Bohae bokbunjajoo. It was a fantastic treat for my birthday. There's a particular sushi guy that has been there both times we went in, a younger guy who speaks some english, and he's awesome. My fiancé is a pro with chopsticks and I suck, and he gave me the kiddie chopsticks with the clip, and we had a good laugh about it. Great food, great service.. You can't ask for much more.

The food is good (slightly expensive for AYCE dinnerwise) but it is close to Henderson and sometimes worth it when you can't or won't drive all the way to Goyemon for sushi. Keep in mind that it is a "hole in the wall" joint and it can get pretty crowded and service can get slow (depending on how many waitresses they have/restaurant traffic).

I felt fine arriving in and then went through with dinner. 
I ordered the Rib Eye, cooked medium rare with my two sides being rice pilaf and roasted veggies. For my started I had baked potato cream soup. Half way through dinner I started feeling nauseous and slowly lost my appetite. I had at least half of my steak, but then felt like I hit a wall and was done. 
Don't get me wrong, the steak was perfectly cooked, but it seemed like everything I ate was super salty! 

It wasn't until the next morning I felt really sick. I'm not talking 'bout hangover sick (because I didn't have any alchie bevies at dinner) but this was a different kinda sick that I wasn't familiar with before. Needless to say, I spent all yesterday morning with the porcelain king, and the only thing I can think of I got sick from the dinner from Claim Jumper. 

Just be careful eating here."}

I went to the northwest location several years back with a giftcard and was terribly underwhelmed. My mom recently  reviewed the menu online and convinced me to go for dinner at the Green Valley location. We were met with a lengthy wait for a table, but stuck it out. Only to be ignored at our table for ten minutes before a drink order was taken. We should have left, but we had invested so much time already. The online menu wasn't current and the entrée she wanted wasn't available. A similar item was $3 more. Totally parched we finally received our drinks. The diet was flat. The iced tea was served with a rotting lemon. Then, later her entrée, came with a rotten potato. They switched it out, but obviously rotten food shouldn't be prepared, let alone leave the kitchen. Cheese, bacon and butter was requested with the potato, and the cheese was some sort of liquid. Ew. The rest of our meal was edible, but underwhelming and overpriced. Plus, we left with upset stomachs."}

So a few days ago when a quick dinner decision was required for a party of 5 adults (3 visiting from other states with no CJ exposure) and a toddler, Claim Jumper was the answer.  

We arrived at 5pm on a weekday and were able to sit in the Saloon and enjoy happy hour drink prices.  

There was too much food ordered to review here - so I will stick to my general consensus of our group.  THE MEAL WAS GREAT, ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, and OVERALL WE HAD A GREAT TIME!   

Some food tips here:
1.  Everyone who ordered shrimp dishes loved them!  The western BBQ shrimp wrapped in bacon was a HUGE HIT.  So much so, that my father-in-law from Ohio returned the NEXT DAY and ordered it again!!  For real!  

2.  The chicken fried steak is not exactly what Southerners are used to.  It was decent, but not going to blow you away.  It's Las Vegas - skip the chicken fried steak here people!  

3.  The potato cakes were the biggest hit.  Order them as a side dish.  You won't be disaapointed.  

4.  The rotisserie chicken which they specialize in was just average.  My father-in-law is a rotisserie chicken man and he said "I've had a better rotisserie at Costco than here."  Now, he still ate the whole chicken, so it must have been good enough for him.  

5.  Hit up the Saloon during Happy Hour - they have over 15 food items to chose from on discount, and more than 15 drink specials.  It will save you lots of money!!"}

Both experiences were great! The hibachi chefs are hilarious and know how to put on a great show.

I definitely recommend this place if looking for a fun moderately priced meal."}

We were treated like ROYALTY! The chef was so incredible and very entertaining. And the food? The BEST!! I ordered the filet mignon, and I have never had a steak melt like butter in my mouth! The shrimp, noodles, and fried rice were also incredible. They ended the night playing "happy birthday" on the restaurants sound system (I'm assuming because we were the only people in the restaurant) while singing and presenting me with a delicious green tea cake and candle!! Such an amazing evening. Thank you for making my birthday so memorable!"}

I've been here about 4 times and every sushi dish and roll I've ordered has been very good to excellent. The not so good news: So far every dish Ive had not sushi related has been mediocre to poor. Once I had a noodle dish that was obviously made the day before and reheated. It was sticky, clumped together and tasteless. Tonight I had a fired won ton appitaizer. At first glance it looked nice, but then I noticed the lettuce it was served on was wilted and brown. If the won tons were good I won't not have cared, but they were so bad I couldn't eat them. The cream cheese inside was cold and pasty while the won ton themselves were tough as shoe leather. Again obviously made the day before and heated up and served. This place has so much potential, but the corners they are cutting is going to make people stop coming here. I may come again for the sushi, but Ill never order anything else here."}

I had my family in town for my bday and wanted to have a nice birthday dinner. We read about the hibachi and family style menu and wanted to do family style since there were 7 of us (all adults). We were greeted very quickly, we opted for a table since they didn't have any hibachi open at the time for 7 people, it wasn't too crowded but there were a few people. We were seated in the sitting area and our waitress AUDREY came to get drink orders. Tried to sneak in a question but ignored me and left. Came back with drinks and asked if we were ready to order, when I said I had a question about family style since that is what we were interested in, she didn't even let me finish as she rudely spoke over me and said we don't do that, then I showed her on the menu where is said family style online and she said that they didn't do that we all had to order indivisdually and then share (that's completely fine portions are huge, I just wished she would have explained it or atleast let us ask questions without being bothered). She then brought out the soups, rather than giving each person one she just told the person at the end. "Pass them down" again with a huge attitude. Same thing with the salad. After she started bringing out the entreees we saw it was a lot and wanted to cancel one of the sides (vegetable fried rice) she said we couldn't do that since the order was already placed again with the attitude. We ate and tried to make the most of our time after all my family came in from California and Arizona for my bday and we were less than thrilled with our service. Like I said the food was phonomenal but AUDREY's service was horrific! Really going to debate on ever returning, especially to this location."}

The waitress barely said two words to us and didn't even let me know what types of soups they had when I ordered the dinner special ( which comes with a soup and salad). No interaction with us at all. We should've had the hibachi which was packed and at least I know the food is fresh. I heard this place was the "best" Japanese cuisine in town and it was far from it.

Our first tie there to. We even made a reservation the night before just in case. Walked in and was greeted right away. They sat us along with three other people. The only thing that got me under my skin was the guy who took my drink order, literally stared me down , rushing me to make a decision on a alcohol drink. I even told him I'm not ready but he didn't get that. He wouldn't leave till I ordered, that was annoying sorry. 

Anyway, the salad was OK. Wasn't that great, I probably will skip it next time. Wasn't fresh... the soup was delicious! Our cook was funny and was very cool. He cooked our food really good. I had the shrimp and New York steak, husband had the lobster, clams and steak. Lobster was very good and he said the clams were rich. I loved the veggies too. We will definitely be going back :) 

**I gave them four stars for the guy who rushed me and the salad. Maybe next time it will be better experience:)"}

They have pretty classic teppanyaki at very affordable prices along with a fairly large menu which includes sushi, Thai, noodles, and rice selections. 

The atmosphere is relaxed with everyone having fun catching shrimp in their mouth and watching knife tricks. On our last visit, we came before the dinner rush on a Friday night around 6, and by the time we finished dinner, the bar and waiting area were full with overflow into the dining area so reservations are recommended, especially on the weekends.

My rare filet was so good from my first visit, that I ordered it again on my second along with a the You and Me sushi roll. The sushi roll was OK, but there are still some other items that I want to try. The chefs season the vegetables and the fried rice very well, which are items usually not too memorable for me. They're very receptive to requests of adding flavors such as butter, garlic, or sauces. And I've noticed the chefs are more interactive with the guests in general compared to other places I've been.

The price of my hibachi dinner was under twenty dollars. As long as I can contain the amount of sake and Sapporos that I consume, my wife and I can get out of here full and paying around $60 for dinner which price I like and will keep us coming back on a regular basis."}

We had a female bartender who was VERY friendly! She had a unique name which I wish I remembered... 5 stars for her. I got a chicken quesadilla and a glass of the house Chardonnay. The quesadilla came out quickly which was awesome but the taste was below average. My bill for the quesadilla and Chardonnay ended up being $20. I think for $20 I can go elsewhere and get a more satisfying dish and drink.

We were seated and later greeted by our waitress. 
I asked for water with lemon, and a spicy cilantro margarita.
My guy ordered a Stella.

Our drinks took at least ten minutes to come.

The margarita was awesome.... Worth the wait.
Possibly the best margarita that I have ever had.
However, the Stella was lacking a little...and not as cold as it should have been.

One thing that really WOW'd me, was that they have a "baby" plate. 
That I had never seen before, or heard of at any other restaurant. 
And it's complimentary! 

It comes to the table, covered in saran wrap,  with a stick of cheddar cheese, a slice of turkey, apple sauce, and mini orange slices. 

Gourmet, no. But very thoughtful. It kept her busy.

We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza as an appetizer, along with the shrimp with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and slathered in BBQ sauce.

The pizza comes out, and it is the wrong size. That gets sent back.
The shrimp were quite good. I would have liked more cream cheese, and they could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce. 

My water was almost gone... Our waitress walked by us at least four times, and didn't refill it.

oh, and did I mention that I was the only one at the table that got water.......? 

When customers are drinking, aren't you suppose to supply water..? Or do these people not watch Bar Rescue.?

One water between the two of us was kind of lame. Between our waitress and the supervisor, they both said that they were "getting our drinks" 3 different times... 

Geez. THANK GOD IS WASN'T SUMMER.

We both ordered another round.
My margarita was again, awesome. However, the Stella this time was flat and gross.. The supervisor took it away.

The right size pizza comes out, and we munch on that. It was good, like better than Metro Pizza good. Happy with that. 

Still waiting for water refills.

I ordered the Frisco burger, on grilled sourdough, with thousand island and fires.
My guy ordered the beef ribs with fried Mac and cheese.

When our food finally arrives, I take a bite. Salty.
I take a drink of my water (waiting for ice cubes to melt, at this point).
I take a second bite to make sure that I'm not too loopy.... Still salty.
I pass it off to my guy (who loves salt) to try it. He thinks it's salty too. 

UGH. The fries were good though. Best fries ever.
A bite is taken out of the fried mac and cheese, and it's not hot.

I finally am able to flag down our waitress, and we let her know about the unsatisfying food. We take dessert (red velvet cupcakes) to go.

This was probably the longest dinner experience I have ever had in my life.

The check comes, and even with my over salty burger and the flat, warm beer taken off, our bill is $93. 

Yes, $93. My guy thought I was joking.

Red velvet cupcakes are Ok. Nothing Bundt Cakes has waayy better Red Velvet.

Stick to just drinks and appetizers here. Nothing else is worth it."}

I ordered the ultimate fish and shrimp dinner plate.  It came with 4 grilled shrimp, 4 battered shrimp, a piece of seasoned fish over a plate of fries.  Everything was overly salty, and unfortunately neither the cocktail or tartar sauce made it any better.  I asked for my fries well done, no salt and neither of it was cooked the way I like it.  The fish was overly seasoned and so needless to say, I got to taste of bit of everything and left unsatisfied and disappointed.  This dish came with a side dish and I ordered a cup of clam chowder that tasted like a cup of salt.  I just picked at the clams and left the whole cup of salt soup alone.   

Not my plate of seafood, so I'm not coming back.  Next time, I'll stick with a much better option at The Cheesecake Factory."}

There weren't too many people so we were sat down quickly.  Our waitress got our orders and drinks very fast. 

We started with an appetizer, lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was prepared well, very tasty and crispy. We were also served garlic cheese bread.

For our main course, I had ordered the country fried steak and a house salad. The steak was cooked well, but it had a bit too much breading on it. My fiancé ordered the ribeye with a house salad- they were made very sloppy. Her ribeye was cooked as she ordered (medium rare). The food was all cooked very well, and I felt that it was totally worth the money. 

My problem I had here was the atmosphere. The restaurant was full of people who lacked manners and courtesy. The waiting staff seemed very rushed and wanted to turn the tables as fast as possible. I have memories of this place being very classy, but it seems to have dropped it's standards. While the food was good, I much would have taken it all to go."}

Compared to a similar dish at Chili's (Cajun Chicken Pasta), with a full chicken piece is on top of the pasta with thick cuts, CJ's was definitely inferior. That pretty much sums it up -- CJ's felt like a poor man's Chili's, despite charging a lot more. My server was quite friendly though, I will give them that."}

The serving of the food was pretty big which is great because it fit the price. The service has always been quite stellar, our server was always pretty great. The food, I would have to say is very good EVERY TIME.  Always up to a high standard.  

Today, however, was a whole 'nother experience. We came in with a party of 8 (technically we asked for a table for 7, plus a high chair for my baby nephew) and we asked if their happy hour was still going on.  We were informed that it was and it was a self-serve area by the bar.  So we just put two tables together and no biggie.  When we walked in the waitress, Olivia, assisted in putting together the tables.  Keep in mind, we only came in here because Cheesecake Factory had a long wait time and we wanted some desserts ONLY. Also, we came in a whole HOUR before the place closed.

Nevertheless, we sat down and we became interested in their happy hour menu which was advertised, not only in their website,  but also all over their tables.  So we decided to add some appetizers to our order.  After ordering, we were informed that the Happy Hour prices are no longer valid, despite the fact that it's clearly stated on ALL their tables and we got a happy hour menu.  She said they just changed the policy that day.  And that the advertised Happy Hour is only valid during the REGULAR Football Season.  Is she stupid?  The REGULAR season is not over until the SUPER BOWL!!!! Uhm, OKAY.  So we placed our orders still and I went to check with the hostess, she got the manager and I spoke to her and she informed us that she will honor the happy hour prices.  

Once we got our order, my sister accidentally spilled a bit of blue cheese in her coffee.  When I asked the waitress for a new cup, she ignored me.  When I asked for an extra bread for my nephew, who wanted more bread, she looked at me with an incredulous expression and paused to say, "uhm, yeah...okay."  She comes back to refill my coffee (without any spoons distributed to us, AT ALL) and proceeded to refill my sister's drink SEEING that there's white stuff floating all over it.  This whole time, she would go back forth to the bar and whisper with the bartender and they would roll their eyes.  

As she poured that coffee, I was astounded at her stupidity and her laziness.  I was just staring at her hoping she would notice and it would click that she should get a new cup.  NOTHING! She avoided eye contact with me and had this stupid smirk on her face like she's mocking us.  WHAT THE HELL!? I understand that she may be having a bad day, but proper customer service should still be practiced to keep professionalism intact.  Unfortunately, she had neither professionalism nor proper customer service etiquette.  I once again asked for the Manager and she could not even do anything but serve us the remainder of our order, in which time, my sister walked out because she couldn't take it anymore.  I have seen a lot of bad customer service in my time, but this has got to be the worst I have ever seen.  She should not be a waitress if she does not like having to wait on others.  It's absurd! It's insulting! And most importantly, it's unacceptable!! This will definitely not be the end of it.  We're great tippers as people who has worked previously in the service industry.  We know the value of a good service and we pay good money when we receive it.  But that service that we received did not even warrant a single penny.  They're lucky my brother in law is still very generous and still left a tip.  I cannot  believe that experience.  

For a company that is under Landry's Inc., who claim that they are the leader in Dining and Hospitality, this kind of service is truly unacceptable.  It's abhorrent and just plain idiocy to have those kinds of servers employed at such a facility.  I will not go back to this location EVER.  Lastly, the hostess, provided better customer service and professionalism that the manager and the two servers we came across during this visit.  WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They totally ruined my sister's 17 years anniversary with her husband!"}

Thank God I did !!! Otherwise she would have disowned me! The restaurant was  nice and looked well organized . I sat at the teppanyaki table and placed my order with the friendly waitress. I ordered the NY steak which came with soup, salad , vegetables and fried rice. I waited patiently for the grill to warm up so that the chef could start cooking, I didn't really need the frills and thrills of the teppanyaki show ( which was great btw) I just wanted to taste the food. Now , I'm not sure if it was because I was the only one at the table and the chefs are used to making larger portions of the fried rice, but my rice was super salty. Moving on to the meat which I ordered medium well and ended up being medium and was tasteless , I tried dipping it in the sauce the chef gave me but those didn't taste so good. Now to my beloved vegetables, they were bitter as if the garlic had been burnt . So basically I paid $20 for a cup of onion soup which was the best thing I ate while I dined here. 2 stars for service added an extra star for soup. Not sure if I would return again."}

Part of our food was delivered to the wrong table and the server didn't even notice some of our party had no food. We had to tell him twice. When I finally got my food, the chicken was so dry it felt like sand in my mouth, the pasta was very over cooked, and the dish didn't have enough sauce. I asked for a vinaigrette for my salad, and I was brought a balsamic reduction/glaze. Way too sticky to dress a salad. The manager came by our table and did not offer to fix anything. He also looked very unprofessional. The food is way overpriced for the quality and portion sizes. Everyone had to ask for drink refills. I won't be going here again."}

Food: 
First, the complimentary cheese bread is delish. I always get the strawberry lemonade, yummmm. 
So far I've had country fried steak- decent, Widow Burger- YUM, Shrimp Fresca- mmm mmm, Salmon- GOOD, 12oz Bone out Rib-eye- MY FAVE. Let's not forget the clam chowder .
Staff:
My waiter tonight was attentive (I forget his name, but ALWAYS kneels down to take orders) quick, knows the items well and quick. I've had some grumpy hosts in the past, but I'm sure everyone has their days. 
Pricing:
the food and quality is is priced reasonably. 
OVERALL:
I'll be returning"}

The pasta was pretty dry, but we got it at the lunch menu price so I was not too disappointed. Lace got the rotisserie chicken with potatoes and loved it.

The service was decent. The host mumbled us to our seat, and the waitress was nice but pretty quiet and was not around much.

I would definitely try this place again and get something else. The interior kind was decent, kind of log cabin style and would be great for big groups."}

Her choice was Claim Jumper! I was excited because I've heard good things about the food. 

We went on a Saturday around noon and surprisingly it was not that busy. They quickly seated us at a table. I loved the chairs, being a larger girl, I appreciate a large chair with no sides.  The decor was like a large dining lodge. I enjoyed the low lighting and decent choice of music. I did not get a chance to visit the bar, but it looked like an excellent place to check out during happy hour.

 Our waiter was on point. He quickly took our drink orders and left us to figure out what we wanted to order off of CJ's HUGE menu! ALL the things sounded good, but I ended up choosing the Original Tri-tip Dip sandwich with a side of seasoned fries. OMG was the sandwich good! There was tons of meat on it, as well as, caramelized onions, roasted peppers and smoked gouda on a French roll with au jus. I would go back just for this sandwich. The meat was tender and the onions were perfectly cooked. Dipping it in the au jus just perfected the bite you got.
My mother- in- law ordered the famous chicken pot pie with fruit on the side. She said it had a flaky crust. The chicken was moist, and the sauce was the perfect texture. Mom said she really liked it and even enjoyed the fruit that came with it.
My one sister-in-law choose the Widow Maker Burger with a side of seasoned fries. Let me tell you this thing was huge! She wasn't sure how she was going to get it in her mouth. It had a thick patty, smoked bacon, hand-battered onion rings, avocado, double-thick cheddar, mayo and red relish. She finished the whole thing! She said she loved it! I could tell she really did.
 My other sister-in-law had the giant stuffed baker. It was a giant baked potato stuffed with charbroiled chicken, roasted vegetables topped with melted cheddar and jack cheese. Also, a cup of alfredo sauce to drizzle on top. She finished the whole thing as well! She said the chicken was not dry at all and the potato was cook perfectly.

To my surprise Claim Jumper was very reasonably priced! The service was excellent. Our waiter even made sure to bring me a cup of the au jus to take home with the other half of my sandwich. I for sure will be coming back and am planning on bringing my husband in for happy hour. Claim Jumper has an amazing variety in their menu that will please everybody from your young child to your grandparents and in between!"}

From their Potato Soup to the Steaks, this place leaves me satisfied. It has a very nice vibe as well. For this visit I got their Sirloin Steak (medium rare), Baked Potato, and the Potato Cheddar Soup. Their bread is also great as well and i'm always looking forward for it. The Steak is really good and has an even amount of seasoning. The flavor from the seasoning just explodes in your mouth after each bite. Whenever I visit, I always get the Potato Cheddar Soup. I never regret getting it after each time. If you dip the bread in the soup, your taste buds will love it. 5/5!"}

The guy at the door said he could still get us a seat at the hibachi table but it would be 10 to 15 minutes. In many places that means more then 15, but in this case it was more like 5 to 10. Decor was nice. The food was very good and the chef was very entertaining. We both got filet mignon and I added chicken to my order. The meat was tender and cooked to order. Only slight negative, I got  the cheesecake for desert and it was pretty small. One of the better hibachi restaurants I've been to. Price was very reasonable. I'll definitely be going back again."}

She tells us there will be a 20 minute wait. I don't mind waiting if the place is busy but you can clearly see from the entrance that there is almost nobody in there and plenty of empty tables. So I inquired and was told by the hostess that they do not have enough servers. 
I don't think that I should spent my evening waiting for a table because management does not know how to schedule, so we left.
This was the final straw for me and we will avoid this Claim Jumper location entirely from here on out."}

Among the chain restaurants, I am partial to Claim Jumper ( you can look at my reviews of their restaurants in Town Square and Downtown Vegas which were positive). We were coming from the movies at Green Valley Ranch with friends and thought we would have an informal, after the movie, dinner at the nearby Claim Jumper. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. We got seated right away and our server came to the table immediately taking our drink orders and bringing the oversized croissant bread plate for the table. The bread was the highlight of the meal. When at Claim Jumper, I usually get one of their salads and my wife usually gets a simple hamburger (bun, burger,  bun). I wanted to try something different, so I ordered their jambalaya. Our friends ordered salad and a burger. My jambalaya came first. Few minutes later, the burgers came. And then the salad. My friend took one bite out of his burger and we had to start looking for the server to send it back. He found it so over salted that it was virtually not edible. My wife wanted her burger medium rare with nothing on it. It came medium well with lots of lettuce and tomato. The server said it must have been someone else's burger. My friends wife also had to return her salad. As to the jambalaya, it was a good sized portion of what looked like a plate of linguine with 6 shrimp on the perimeter. I did find two small pieces of what looked like luncheon meat chicken mixed in with the pasta. There was absolutely no sausage. There were no vegetables that I could find. In my experience, jambalaya should have some kick to it. This was absolutely bland. I can't say that the dish was bad. But it certainly wasn't good. And it certainly wasn't anything that I would call jambalaya. They did make good on my friend's burger as well as my wife's burger. But they were brought to the table separately much later,  well after I had finished my meal. The salad came back even later than that. So while we all sat at the same table, we ate our meals separately. At the end of the meal, someone who I believe was a manager came to the table with the standard "so how was everything?" frankly, she should have known and come to the table with an apology. The bottom line for me: 1. When at Claim Jumper,  stick with ordering the salads, they do a good job with them in general. 2. Don't eat at the Green Valley Claim Jumper. Stick with town square and downtown. Those kitchens seem to work well. The Green Valley outlet, not so much."}

Have not been to a Claim Jumper before so we gave it a try. Definitely on the "won't do that again " list. 

Arrived about 8:30 it was pretty quiet and dark  inside. There was no wait which kind of made me wonder why on a Friday night. Walking past the food prep area two of the wait staff were laughing loudly after one dropped an F bomb in front of us. We were seated and we had a nice quiet meal that was on par with Denny's for a premium price. My salad was good other than they make croutons out of sweet corn bread. The combination of Blue Cheese dressing and yellow cake croutons was just wrong.

I ordered fish and chips because it's hard to mess that up. Wrong again. Over cooked fish jerky fried in rancid oil. All on a huge pile of soggy french fries. My wife got grilled shrimp and fillet Mignon. A different  waiter brought her plate and announced here's your sirloin and shrimp. He was told we ordered Fillet Mignon and grilled shrimp not Sirloin and Fried shrimp. He said Oh I think it's the same thing. No sirloin and fillet Mignon is not the same thing. He took the plate back to the kitchen. Our waiter came back and said whats the problem? We told her and she went to the kitchen and brought the same plate back with a side of grilled shrimp. I seated facing the kitchen and could see that her plate had not moved from when it was taken back. Now it had been sitting back there and was cold. Well we left knowing why it was nearly empty on a Friday night."}

The first time ever in my life I have to say the word f* and sh* in public. It reached my limit. At 3pm, I called and made a reservation for a party of 7 people at 7:30pm, then at 5:30pm I called again and said if I could change the reservation time to be sooner. I was told that YES. We arrived there at 6:35pm and was confirmed by the MANAGER that he doesn't have a table for me at that time, but would try to get a table for us in 10 min. While we were waiting, the other waitress told us that there was a table should be finished soon. 20 min has passed. We came back inside and realized that that table was taken by another party. We asked and that MANAGER told me that sorry but I gotta wait another 30 min. He said that: "i try my best to get the table for you, but because you called today to make reservation, while others had made reservations yesterday" WOW, really????? If it's full, why did you accept the reservation?? Because you are greedy????? I really need a better explanation of how we are treated like that. I wanna say sorry to the owner if I had said the bad words in the restaurant, but sorry I couldn't hold myself anymore. I couldn't ever imagine I was treated like that. We didn't come to eat for free. We deserve a better treat. Also, when I told him that if you wanted us to wait another 30min, why didn't he tell us at first? And why the other waitress told us that we could get the table in 10'. His answer was: " they don't know anything, they don't have the right to coordinate the table". My little 11-year-old cousin responded: " so why did you hire her if she doesn't know anything". In short, don't come to this replace if you don't wanna feet refused for the service. I wish Yelp had the option for Zero star, because they don't even deserve 1 star."}

Given we had a group of 25, I had fairly low expectations for the service, but they did an excellent job! From the time we sat down to the time we left it was just over two hours, which I think is pretty decent with a group that size! 

Now beware, the menu is huge. Pages on pages! I had my mind made up three different times and finally when put under some pressure, made a decision. I settled on the Frisco Burger and fries, a swiss cheese burger with thousand island dressing served on grilled parmesan sourdough (like toast, not a bun). It was tasty but nothing special. I actually wish it were served on a bun. If I were to describe my eating pace, I'd say its fairly normal (if I'm not lying, a little quicker than the average) and the bread quickly became soggy. The fries were also nothing special, thinly cut with a good crunch. Again, nothing wrong with the food but I could get a similar burger under ten bucks elsewhere. 

Overall, everyone in the group seemed content and no problems arose, but I think this is a one and done experience for me."}

By the acrobatics of your main entrée, the chef's one-liner puns, and of course, the sudden blazes of fire erupting from the famed onion volcano.

Although they do offer sushi and many other items on the menu, my boyfriend and I decided to go forth with the hibachi grill for an early v-day dinner. He made us reservations which was very convenient on a Saturday night. We were seated right away despite the small crowd in the waiting area. To start, we both got the HIBACHI BASIC ENTREE ($8.95) which consists of their house salad, onion soup, vegetables, and choice of rice/noodles. From there, you select your choice of your meat/seafood which range from $6.95 (chicken) to kobe beef ($48.95).

He got the chicken which the chef sliced up nicely into bite-sized pieces, and I got the shrimp which came to about seven pieces. Both were seasoned with lemon, garlic, and butter -- yum. The fried rice was good, too. However, the mixed veggies are not. That's probably why they give you ginger sauce for them to offset the blandness. Mine came with a lot of onions, and really, I think they're just there for decoration. The people next to us didn't really eat theirs either. To drink, I had a taro boba smoothie ($4.75). The boba balls were kind of hard, but the smoothie itself was the right amount of sweet.

Overall, great interactive experience and good place to take guests. Funny to watch people's reactions, especially the little ones. Warning: Don't be surprised if the chef attempts to throw food into your mouth not unlike a sea world trainer to a hungry seal."}

It was weird. Then once he was finishing up cooking the server was seating another family at another hibachi table and I could see him being visibly very disgruntled mouthing and using tons of hands motions to the server. He finally gave up and rolled his eyes, I'm sure because he saw me watching him he explained he was so annoyed and so sick of servers not filling the small tables first because then he has to clean the larger tables. Overall he started off ok then seemed to be burnt out or annoyed. I'm not expecting the moon.. I don't even need all the fried rice hearts and onion volcanos, it's the same every time.

The cook came out and verified our orders and cleans the grill. He started with the fire show asking is how big of a fire we wanted. We responded "big".

The food was just ok. We ordered a variety of things like chicken, steak and shrimp. Our orders came with vegetables and a choice of fried rice or noodles. The noodles were not that good.

For our lunch we had the Chopped Cobb salad 4/5 which comes with grilled chicken, crumbles of bleu cheese, plenty of avocado, bacon, diced egg and tomatoes topped off with bleu cheese dressing. And the black tie chicken pasta 4/5. The pasta is one of my favorites and is served with blackened chicken, bow tie pasta, spinach tortelloni stuffed with cheese and diced tomato all tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce yum yum! Very filling but good to the last bow tie pasta!

They also brought out some toasted cheese topped bread, which accompanied the meal well. 

We thought we were ready to ask for the check then realized...we couldn't possibly leave without splitting a slice of carrot cake! The carrot cake was huge and topped with crunchy shreds of carrot which gave it a nice texture 5/5. This is why we keep coming back for more! Additionally, for your birthday they bring you out either a red velvet cupcake or a small cake and ice cream topped with sprinkles.

It was not very busy. The cocktail waitress Kassandra came right over and explained the Happy Hour Specials. We made our first drink order. The drinks were served in about 12 minutes. Then we made a second order of drinks and food, the food came out on time but the Bartender Chasser was not on point. Eveytime I looked over she was either checking her phone or just talking with 2 customers at the bar.  So we waited and waited for another round of drinks and about 25 minutes later we were done and wanted out check. We cancelled the last order of drinks. This is our second innocent with Chasser and it was NOT GOOD.  When Happy Hour begins you should have at least 2-3 Bartenders on hand. Very disappointed.  Will not be retuning anytime soon..."}

Steak- way overcooked, after ordering medium well, unedible on outer layers with aggressive peppering making it way too spicy for no reason except to...hide flavor of meat?? DIdn't eat 1/3 of it

Veggies-bland ugh . No I am not on a low sodium diet nor did I expect hospital food. Didn't eat barely any

My son's pizza...the greasiest oil infested rounded plain dough slapped together like he made it himself. Didn't even eat half of it

I like their pies and their potato cheesecakes. I would much rather get appetizers and dessert here always. And even then, can I accept to pay these prices for this?"}

She mentioned that they serve large portions so we decided to split the Ore Cart. The bread they bring out was sooo good, but it stuck to my teeth a lot. Their chicken and tri tip was really good. The chicken was like almost a whole chicken which was pretty cool and definitely lives up to the large portion remark (the price matches the portions though, $30 for the ore cart). We had tried to get a side of veggies but they were super limited in their options which is why they lost a star. No broccoli?? That is a crime. And no green beans or zucchini. So we got mashed potatoes with country gravy and mac n cheese. The mashed potatoes were really good but the mac n cheese was very plain. The sauce didn't stick to the noodles well (too watery?) and I ended up eating dry noodles most of the time.  Definitely a good place to check out if you love meat!"}

Ok Ohajah, straight to the point. I am not a fan. Reason being, my chicken came out tasting like rubber and my entire meal came out luke warm, which leads me to believe, my meal which was the spicy chicken was precooked and preheated ‍ so not enjoyable! Ok so I try my partners who purchased the Thai chicken, same thing rubber every-other piece.  Siggghhhh moving on to the onion soup that came with the meal, onion what onion, flavor, where? Just tasteless.. the spicy California Roll, not a fan either. The entire Roll once again taste like it was premade, nothing fresh about it within the Roll. Now the plus side of Ohajah, my garlic edamame was perfect!!!! Warm, tons of flavor fresh!!! I would come to this location everyday for the garlic edamame it's pure perfection.
The atmosphere is beautiful as well, the private dinning area is a neat addition to the large grills they have, this location also has a full bar with a area just for sushi , the prices are great and the   Meal size very large, I would share with two people. Well never the less, I am not a fan but I would come back for a drink from the bar and Edamame! During the lunch hour at a discounted rate."}

The table servers/hosts make us feel rushed sometimes while we decide on what we want, or after our food has been cooked, but while Jason is entertaining us with his awesome skills and great personality we never feel like he's on autopilot like some other chefs are. That's why we make sure to request him every visit. Another great thing about him is how he interacts with the kids. My son falls for the ketchup trick every time.

When I lived in CA, I frequented CJ quite a bit and never had a disappointing meal.  I think I'm secretly in love with the chocolate mother lode cake and disguise it by saying how much I enjoy the restaurant and think their food is great, yada, yada, yada.  

I was happy to see this location in NV and decided to get my favorite salad, the California Citrus Salad, to go.  It's a great combination of greens, avocados, mandarin oranges, green onions, golden raisins, cranberries and candied walnuts.  Soooooooooo good!  

While waiting for our orders, my co-worker and I decided to get a brownie to split.  It was big, of course, so it was like having one whole "normal" brownie.  Sad to say, this was the first disappointing thing I've had.  It wasn't as moist inside as I expected, not as chewy on the outside as I would have liked, and I now realize I don't care for nuts with my brownies.   Oh well.  It was chocolate, so there was no way I wasn't going to finish it.

If you haven't been to CJ, you're in for a treat.  Just save room for the chocolate mother lode cake!"}

Best tepanyaki experience we have ever had! Our chef (wish I knew his name) was awesome. The show was perfect for our group and the food was AMAZING! I ordered the filet, shrimp and chicken, everything was cooked to perfection and the steak just melted in my mouth. The fried rice and vegetables had the perfect amount of garlic and seasoning, no additional soy sauce required. The servers were quick with drink refills and keeping the table clear of mess. Our waitress let my daughter pick her birthday dessert, which she loved. She got green tea Mochi and what a treat it was! So good. I would definitely recommend Ohjah to anyone and we will be returning anytime a craving for teppan hits!"}

I highly recommend the tri-tip sliders, street tacos and pretzels! All very good and all cheap to. 

The service at the bar is solid to. I started to joke with the bartender that CJ was becoming my go to hang out place to grab a drink and food after work because the specials are just that good.

OK, good enough.  Gabriel introduced himself and ask if we had been here before and did we have our rewards card.  Yes, to both.  They guys got a pitcher of beer and me an iced tea.  I love it when they bring a carafe so you can fill your own refills.
He brought a hot loaf of bread but we had to ask for some butter.  Our large order of crispy parm zuchinni rings arrived quickly and we devoured all but 2.  2 of both ordered the clam chowder instead of a salad, but we had to ask twice for some hot sauce to spice it up a little.  Entrees took a while but the wait was ok while the app and soup settled.  Ignacio had the after the gold rush chicken marsala and enjoyed it but was unable to finish it.  Uriel had the calzon but it was missing the pepperoni and sausage he requested and only had cheese in it.  He returned it and nibbled from both of our plates, which was ok.  The manager came over and offered a free mile high chocolate cake for the mistake.
I had the 7 oz steak and fried shrimp.  Steak was cooked perfect.  Shrimp were kind of soggy and cold.  I ate about half the large baked potato.

This is definitely a large bar area with booths, tables and outdoor seating as well as plenty of seats at the bar.  Only a few tv's in there so place yourself accordingly if you want to watch a game. 

Our waiter, William, was over in seconds to greet us.  He provided exemplary service the entire time.  Definitely knowledgeable of the menu with great suggestions.  I'll make sure to ask for his section next time! Thank you William!

We opted to split some pretzel sticks w/cheese.  Only $2 on the Happy Hour menu.  Love it!  But we can't just stop there.  We also split the Widow Maker Burger.  Phenomenal!  They cooked it perfectly as requested.  This sandwich is piled high with smoked bacon, onion rings, avocado, cheddar and tomato.  The burger was juicy and delicious. I would definitely get this again.

They have pretty good HH Menu options.  With happy hour times everyday and ALL day on Sunday, it's really convenient.  I would love to stop back in again soon!"}

I ordered the Drunk Chicken (what a name) and it was actually better than I had expected. The chicken was extremely tender and still maintained its moisture, despite the fact that it's grilled chicken breast. The Bacon-Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce tasted mainly of bacon and was a bit too oily, but yummy nonetheless. Who doesn't love bacon? "Potatocakes" aka croquettes were nice and creamy...

Service was average at best, but that's ok because the food more then made up for it. If I recall right our drinks never ran flat and we stayed topped off. I have eaten at many Claim Jumpers and this one can hang with the best of them."}

We ordered individually because we all have a preference to what starch we like. Then the entrees we ordered we partially served to the other people sitting at the teppan table. Our party had 4 adults, 1 teen, and 1 baby (2 yrs old), but we always order more food. We ordered 6 entrees: 3 chicken, 1 steak, 1 lobster and 1 shrimp for all to share. Instead the guy cooking shared our three chicken with the other two parties at our table. We usually have left overs to take home, but this time we felt less than full when we left. Very disappointing, never experienced this at Ohjah Decautur. We'll never go back to Ohjah Pecos. ;("}

Big portions are good if the flavor is just as big, but this isn't the case for (this) Claim Jumper. 

Appetizer platter was large and had a good variety. The baked potato entree was bland; the veggies were okay. Alfredo sauce didn't do anything for me. We also ordered chicken fried steak. It was two huge pieces, about 5" or more in diameter, and from my sample, tasted pretty good. A lot better than my baked potato, that's for sure.

Desserts menu is decent sized, and even their "mini" desserts are enough for two people to share. The mini I-Declair was good, but not the greatest and I wouldn't order it again.

The only good thing about this place was the service. It was huge, no wait (due to there being lots of open tables on a Saturday night), and quick service. We didn't have to wait too long for our appetizer or food. Our waiter was entertaining and funny and should probably quit this job and be a waiter somewhere else."}

After reading a few reviews prior, we were hoping to get Jason as our hibachi chef and sure enough we did. He was definitely brag worthy!! 
We came on a Saturday night with a 7:30 pm reservation, and waited about 10 minutes. We were seated along with another party, and Jason introduced himself while doing a few things with his knives that will definitely catch your eye and as he put it, "wake up!!". I'd rather much not tell about the entire experience with him because I really think it's worth seeing it for yourself! Overall he was a nice man with funny comments and definitely kept us smiling and laughing. 
For the both of us, it came out to about $40 but that's also with my appetizer of teriyaki chicken on the side.
We were so stuffed! We chose the hibachi teppanyaki that came with onion soup, side salad with their own style dressing, and fried rice. With $6-7 more for the protein choice, (we had chicken). 
It's definitely worth checking this place out. Highly recommended, and worth every cent. Fresh, and a nice experience. Perfect for a date night too!"}

I can't say I enjoyed my food but, my boyfriend enjoyed his meal a lot. He liked the steak that he ordered and said it was the best he ever had. I had a piece and can attest that it was very nicely marinated. My food; however, was salty to the point where I couldn't eat it. The BBQ shrimp were good but, I was hoping for something lighter on the salt after that appetizer and did not get that in the entree. They tried very hard to accommodate my tastes and brought a salad without anything salty which I enjoyed. Maybe next time they won't put as much salt. I would come back based on service.

I haven't been to a Claim Jumper in a couple of years.  I don't know why I stopped.  Maybe because I thought the food was just okay.  

Upon my husband's insistence, we took my mother in law for dinner here since she has never been to one.  She absolutely loves The Cheesecake Factory so this was new to her. 

Our server was really attentive.  The bread was good and the water was plentiful but pretty much ended at that unless you count the cake we took home which was okay.  

I don't mind paying good $$$ for a good meal.  I work in the food industry. I have shelled out some decent money at The French Laundry.   But at least have some decency to have some ounce of truth in your advertising.  Or at least attempt to make the dishes you advertise look as advertised.  The salmon oscar was $29.99.  I asked for it to be medium rare and what came out was a 4-5 oz fish portion with a smattering of crab.  What a sad dish.  

I have become more vocal of not accepting half the dish I ordered since I am certainly paying full price for it.  So I told the server my disappointment.  She sent the manager and he came over to ask if I would like anything else.  Mind you my companions are halfway through their meals already.  So I ordered the shrimp fresca.  I should have known from the previous event that it will absolutely NOT look like the picture but I took a chance.  Disappointment once again seized the chance to show me he was king!  

You would think that the server would realize that I was disappointed in my dish since I refused to take the rest of it home.   But I guess we no longer train our service employees to read disappointment in the faces of our guests.  

It will probably be another couple of years before I would ever go back to a Claim Jumper.  Probably NEVER.  I should have been more insistent on The Cheesecake Factory."}

I explained what was wrong and he said sorry it was his fault and he would order a new burger.
This burger came out in five minutes and dropped in front of me. After requesting that a different waiter send over the manager, my waiter came by to ask about my burger.
The Manager was nice and she did remove the burger off my check but nothing else. After two hours, I had two drinks and some chips no dinner... Sucks"}

The food was good, although its not quite Beni Hana. The chef was great. Entertaining, fun to watch, completely engaged with the people at the table! 

Regarding the food. I had the Filet. It was cooked perfect. t just lacked flavor. Even with the sauces they provide. The sauces tasted watered down a bit. Not a lot of flavor in them.

About the service. Our waitress was just "there". By that I mean she never paid attention to what we wanted. I asked for water with no lemon, I got water with lemon. I asked for white rice, I got fried rice. 

Not sure if I would return. Especially when Beni Hana is here!"}

We enjoyed the ambiance. It was a big dining space but at least half full. The service was also good. But the food was just OK. We ordered a white sangria, pretty tasty and very little alcohol -- just the way we like it. We also got a side salad that was fine, but not memorable. The shrimp fresca pasta was extremely buttery but not very salty, and the shrimp were overbreaded. The tenderloin tips were also OK with the beef being a bit chewy. We would probably go to Cheesecake Factory next time we're in the mood for big portions of classic American fare."}

While not the most traditional and a more franchise generic type of establishment, you will find your hankering for steak, chicken, seafood and alcoholic drinks well taken care of here. 

The ambiance is very nice, there is a small sushi bar and plenty of teppanyaki tables. If you are entertaining, or just gathered with friends this is a great place. 

Service is very good here. 

In terms of a real authentic Japanese meal, well don't choose this place for that reason. I would put this place on par with those Brazilian steakhouses in terms of a style more than an authentic experience. This is like having your meat grilled with salt pepper and soy sauce or teriyaki sauce.

I have eaten here several times and also tried their new branch that just opened near Summerlin.   They do give the same service and the same quality and quantity of food.   THis is so important to keep these two together.  Staff is always friendly as well.

Me and the lady took my son out for late lunch. I was happy to see that a vegetarian section was on the menu. Very many vegan choices but was happy anyways for the effort. The place is still decorated with that country and snow Lodge feel. The people are nice and our server was nice. Probably could have been a little more friendly but they were nice. I ordered the lemon pepper fried zucchini sticks and a side of fries. My wifey ordered the pork sliders with fries. My son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. While we were waiting they got our drinks and delivered a cheesy bread which I couldn't have but both my son and wife said it was really good. I didn't see much of my server but my drinks stayed filled and the manager walk by one time and said hi. Now let's get to the food. Portion size is still large which is a plus. Like I've said before leftovers are always great. Each meal looks very appetizing and the food was tasty. My wife and son both agreed and the atmosphere was nice as well we sat outside in the patio. good job Claim Jumper! Keep it up it seems to be working! If I could add anything it would be more vegan options. Now I don't want to take away from this place as it is a meat-and-potatoes kind of establishment. But maybe a couple vegan options wouldn't be bad. Thanks again for a good time!"}

Now Open!" hanging out in front was calling my name. Cool, we have the popular Vegas sushi/ teppanyaki style steakhouse now here in Henderson.

Really nice, classy, contemporary, yet casual vibe. The staff greeting, will ask you where you prefer to sit. Hibachi area, sushi bar, or dining room.

Hibachi 411
So we chose to dine in this area. It takes up 40% of the place. There are 5 hibachi grills. Each seats 10 people. Busy late afternoon (the linner hour) had 3 grills with 3 chefs already. 

-Menu-
Requirement when you are sitting at these tables each person order the basic entree.
It includes vegetables, house salad, onion soup, and your choice fried noodle or rice (steamed, fried, or brown) $8.95

Then you can choose your proteins: steak, chicken, seafood ..serving sizes are written next to each selection. Prices range for each selection $6.95 up to $48.95 for the Kobe Beef. So your average $ per person here if they order entree and 2 meats approx $26 per person.

The sushi and dinner menu is also available sitting here, but we opted just to have appetizers.

Our party had steak, chicken and fried rice.  Everything was good. Fresh, quality cut beef. Seasoned just right. Nothing salty at all. House salad had a nice ginger dressing.  

The chef that worked our table was entertaining, skilled and engaged with each one of us. But I was his favorite, so I got more veggies and rice than anyone else..ha ha.

Service was awesome by everyone in here. Overall, really nice dining experience. We all want to come back and check out dining in the tatami rooms next.

Note: Not open for lunch ...They start dinner hour at 3pm.

Location 
Pecos/Windmill in the builidng where Pumi used to be. Those who know the place,..it's totally different...Ohjah did a great job remodeling this space. A bunch of diners were already repeat customers from their Vegas location and was so happy about this place They like it more because it's bigger and much fancier. Im happy that Ohjah is now part of our neighborhood too!"}

Very poor service and cooking. I ordered the shrimp meal. The cook was absolutely horrible. No show like the last time we were here. All he did was poop food on the grill and cook it. He did talk with us but only said how important his customers were. So I the food. Every egg he broke had egg shell in it and he mixed it into the fried rice. Then he kept adding oil, oil, and more oil. No season at all. The rice was brown but only from over cooking it and burning all the oil in it. When I took a bite it tasted of oil and I was so pleased to get some broken egg shell. I set the bowl right back in the grill and said something to the cook. I got no answer. On to the shrimp. I got 5 pieces of shrimp in my meal.?and it was loaded down with oil. Thank good ness for the sauce on the side. It took away some of the oil taste. Buy wait, I didn't get any vegetables when the other did. When I said something he asked for some vegetables from the back. Again drilling with oil and even after I asked him not to use so much. So my 5 pieces of shrimp cost me $19.00. Almost $4 a shrimp. Expensive dinner. I didn't eat the rice or vegetables. Not one person in that resteraunt asked about the meal or why I left the food there.  I don't recommend this place anymore. And if you get the chef with the orange camo hat run for the hills."}

The service is good, but did make me feel rushed on a couple of occasions. The food is decent, but not spectacular. They have a very diverse & creative sushi menu and I always seem to find something new to try. The teppanyaki area looks fun & doesn't seem overpriced, though I've never eaten in that area. I've tried a lot of food here & most is pretty good, but I was a bit disappointed with the yakisoba. Maybe the day I tried it they ran out of yakisoba noodles, as mine were large white noodles, similar to udon noodles. I haven't tried it again since the one time as I was pretty disappointed with that dish. Overall, this place is family friendly, has a nice ambiance & decent Japanese food."}

The salad bar is fairly large with all the fixings usually associated with a salad bar... They have a baked potato section as well and 2 soup options...  I thought the veggies were fresh, the salads were fresh, and the dressings were really good.  The chicken pot pie is one of my faves at this joint, this time as with others, it was good..  The mother lode cake,, huge chocolate cake with 7 layers.  It takes me several sittings to finish it...  They have a fresh bakery onsite that bakes their breads and rolls you know its fresh.  I have tried the ore cart, and the ribs... Both selections are really good and big portioins...  In my opinion, this plays gets it right... They serve good tasting food, the portions are way big, service is good and the prices are reasonable for what you get...  I whole heartedly recommend this location to yelpers.... I like this place and i hope you all do as well... Hope this yelps"}

Looking confused, the hostess then asked us what we are here for sushi or hibachi. 
There was only two of us and three hibachi stations with about 10 seats for each. The lady then placed us at some seats off to the side of the hibachi table where this was our first time, we wanted the full experience and she said "is this ok?" And we said is it ok if we sit in the front and she said "no we can't because we have a large party of 7 people and they need to sit together". So other than us not be accommodated, the prices were really reasonable. $5 for a glass of wine that was shockingly really really good. We walked out of there each paying $25 and getting wine, a full meal and dessert.

For the meal you can choose between fried rice or noodles and you get a side salad and soup and then you pick your entree (shrimp, beef, Kobe beef, chicken) and get a side of vegetables too. 

I had the mango cheesecake that was really good but tiny."}

But I went ahead & ordered my favorite thing on the menu...the Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich.  When it arrived, it was HALF the size it normally is.  I soon discovered why!  The wonderful slaw/lettuce mix they had always used & added so much to the sandwich, was now changed to crappy & plain ole lettuce.  I was NOT happy in the least.

Fast forward to lunch today when I took my other half of the sandwich for left overs.  Imagine my shock when I bit down on a chicken BONE!!!  It freakin broke my molar tooth.  Then I found 2 more hard white bone grisle pieces that had been mixed into the Chicken Salad Mixture.  I just sent the Corporate office a nasty gram via email.  I had BETTER hear back from someone.

I do have to say, the waiter (cant remember his name) was really great & explained that corporate just made all these changes to bring Claim Jumper out of the 1980's.  Apparently, Claim Jumper was just purchased by some other corporation & decided to change things.  I will NOT return to the Green Valley Parkway location ever again.  I normally go to the Summerlin location.  I may never return at all.  It is such a shame because Claim Jumper has always been one of my favorite places to eat.

I do have to say, the new onion rings were delicious.  I guess they had been previously frozen like the fried zucchini.  Now they are hand battered & made fresh.  That was the only good change corporate has made.

If it wasn't broke, why fix it???"}

Primarily because it just never struck me as something special and it really isn't. I always remember the food as being just a shrug. Nothing bad, but nothing great either. However, I have been visiting their restaurants lately per request of family and these recent experiences have changed my view of this brand and their food.

The last time I dined here, I decided to take a different route and go with a steak. I ordered their Ribeye Steak: hand-cut, boneless USDA Choice, 12oz  ($24.29) with Salt & Pepper Shoestring Fries. To my surprise, the meat was delicious. Tender, grilled perfectly to medium rare, and most importantly, tasty. I was floored. I have spent more money on less steak to have it cooked improperly! I was ecstatic. The fries were unbelievably salty though. It was okay though because I was just so happy about my steak. I also tried some of my fiance's Chicken Pot Pie ($13.29) and I couldn't believe it was better than the one I had at Grand Lux Cafe in September!

We also visited this past Thanksgiving with my fiance's parents. I selected the roasted turkey with gravy, stuffing, cranberry relish, baked potato with butter and chives, and roasted vegetables. Again, delicious! The turkey was surprisingly moist, gravy was tasty, the stuffing was also moist, the relish was sweet and added texture to compliment everything else really well, and the carrots, zucchini, red onions, and yellow squash were roasted perfectly! It was truly a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and very, very filling. The apple pie and pumpkin pie offered with the dinner were just okay. Oh, we were also served gigantic dinner rolls were so delicious.

Although Claim Jumper won't be one of my first choices for dining out, I can say that I am truly pleased with the food and wouldn't mind returning. I had a hard time deciding on 3 or 4 stars since the food has definitely been a four-star experience, however, the service and over dining experience would warrant three stars (our server couldn't remember anything - our orders, that there was a child in our party, if we paid our bill, etc - it was odd)."}

We did the hibachi dinner (of course), although I do want to go back in the future specifically for the sushi boat as that looked awesome. 

It was a really short wait from when we ordered to when the chef started cooking and the wait felt even shorter as after ordering they almost immediately brought out the salad and onion soup (yum). The entertainment factor was fun and it was interesting to actually get to watch everything get cooked.

The actual grilling takes place in 3 stages: the rice/noodles (FYI that brown rice is brought out to you by a waiter and not from the hibachi grill in front of you), vegetables, and finally meat & seafood. I like to eat my food groups mainly separately anyway so this worked out well for me as I could start on the items as they came off the grill, but if you're a big "combined plate" person, waiting through 3 stages for your complete plate might seem to be a little much. 

I decided on the shrimp and brown rice and also got to try the sole. The shrimp came off the grill with great flavor and cooked perfectly. The sole was flakey and delicious and was a fairly large piece of fish. I am looking forward to trying the fried rice and the scallops in the future as those looked amazing coming off the grill and the scallops were huge. 

One of the best things about this hibachi grill though is the pricing. I wanted to price compare so I looked at the Benihana menu on the strip (the next closest hibachi grill) and the prices there were $10-15 dollars more per plate than Ohjah. Dinner at Ohjah was a really fair price and I'm excited to bring more friends and family in the future."}

I'm not a person who returns stuff, because I don't want my food messed with, so I just ate it without complaint. My bf ordered the chicken fried steak and it was HUGE. He is a big eater, but he couldn't even finish that. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, a burger and meatloaf. One thing to mention is they are no longer selling garlic bread. Instead, they bring a medium size roll with a marinara sauce brushed on top. It was ok, but nothing special. 

I ordered the motherlode cake for dessert for all of us to share and that was amazing. Super chocolatey, decadent and rich. Yum. I would come back to this Claim Jumper, but I would order something different."}

We go to the bar and wait ten min. and have a drink. The same man seats us at a new table, when I look over at our old seats two people are sitting in them. Immediate reaction was that this place is complete bullshit and they do not know how to treat people. We told the man how we felt and left directly. I would never step in this place and the people have no manners. WORST PLACE EVER!!!! DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE!!!!"}

( not my decision )  This place still "SUCKS" and always will in now, both our books!!!  Thank god!!! Now, she finally See's what i was talking about this whole time. OK, she had the Roasted tri-tip and I had the country fried steak. OMG.......GROSS!!!!!   what a lump of sh**.  I'll post a pic of what I scrapped off it. ( Pic. is next to my profile pic. ) To start the waiter was da da duh....we asked for ( No lemon ) in our water and yep...you guessed it lemon. He said: i couldn't remember if you wanted lemon or not so i put it on there for you. I said: we told you 30 seconds ago, glad we are not allergic to it!!  First nose dive...Appetizer was good had the roasted artichoke ( bout the only thing they know how to make ).  Then the dreaded  so-called food came.  Waiter forgot her bread that comes with it, and no gravy poured on the tri-tip.  Mine looked like it came from a cow patty field in Jasper Oklahoma!!!  I really didn't want to even eat it.  I think a two year old could have done a better job at making it rather than them.  What makes me wonder is how this place stays in business!  No disrespect to other people but, I think they don't know what "GOOD FOOD IS".  If I was the health department I would shut this place down in a heartbeat for awful tasting wanna be food.    Overall rating:  - F -F -F -F -F   five minus F's!!!!!!   ( i wish they had a food sucks rating )  To sum it up...We will NEVER step foot in there ever again!!!!     (   THANK GOD!!!!  )"}

They said the wait time was 25 minutes at 6:45pm on a Friday. About 16 customers were waiting to be seated in the waiting area, and a few more in the bar area. It took about 25 minutes to be seated...but we counted at least 9 unoccupied tables and 40 unoccupied seats in the area we were seated. I Ordered the Steak Chili Baker.  Bread was hot.  The Chili inside - STONE COLD.  Like someone opened a can of .89 cents Chili from a shelf and and simply spooned it in.  The menu indicated it would be topped with "Cheddar Cheese", 3 small shreds of cheese. I tried 2 spoonfuls, the meal (if that's what Claim Jumper calls a meal), was sent back 98% untouched. When I told the server  it was cold, she simply said she would have it "heated up". This response is what made me furious. Manager came buy a few moments later with a most insincere apology and his only response was an attempt to sell me something else. The sales receipt shows "Kitchen Error, COLD" on it where they backed out the cost.  Cold either means not cooked, or cooked and then left out until room temperature. Either way, this is a health hazard.  I will be notifying Southern Nevada Health District.

UPDATE 3/15/2012
Both the Assistant Manager and the Manager called me (I submitted a complaint on the Claim Jumper Website) to offer their apologies and express how they will better coach their staff."}

First time we ate sushi, and while the pricing was very reasonable, the quality of the fish was only average.  The second time we ate at the hibachi grill. Our chef was good but not exceptional in his 'act' while preparing our food.  You could hardly hear his comments as he performed.  More importantly, the hibachi food was uninspired.  The Gyoza were under-cooked. The fried rice was basically rice with egg and a little scallion and lots of minced garlic.  The vegetables were properly cooked but bland, with the primary taste being the onions.  The NY steak was properly cooked, but a mix of chewy and parts that were tender.  The scallops were large, for the most part properly cooked (except for one under-cooked) .
Again, the pricing was extremely reasonable, but food not worth the trip."}

I called back an hour later and made the reservation.  When I showed up, they didn't have it.

They told me we would have to wait for 40 minutes, even though the restaurant was half-empty on a Friday night.  (That's another sign.  Where is the business during Friday dinner).

They seated us early.  Didn't matter.  It took an hour to get the food.  I could hear the manager apologizing to another table next to us, so it must be common.  

Not only that, people who showed up later got their food earlier.  And the food?  Nice and cold.

Boycott this place.  Maybe we can get a better restaurant to replace it."}

Seating in the bar is usually not a problem.  The food deals are a steal.  

Some of my favorite happy hour food items: the small salads, loaded skins, street tacos, calamari, and spinach artichoke dip.  I wish the fries with the gravy sauce was still on there.  

I can't leave Claim Jumper without the butter cake dessert.  Even if I can only fit two bits, I will just take the rest home and have an amazing breakfast.  I keep meaning to try the new salted caramel butter cake, but then I forget when I am there!

Service is acceptable.  My girls and I have had days where we were slightly ignored due to how busy the establishment is.  I get it.  Most times I see it going that way, I make sure to grab the server and get the second drink ordered before I run out of the first one.  

Speaking of drinks, you can never go wrong with a glass of wine.  However, if you are so inclined, the lemon drop martini and raspberry martini are excellent.  I also like their mojito.  

Of course, the full menu is available in the bar area.  Claim Jumper has some solid fish and comfort food entries.

When it was finally our time to sit and eat the waitress thank us for our patience which was nice. We ordered our food and they brought out this garlic cheese loaf that tasted amazing, the last time we were there they had the sun dried tomato one which is also very tasty. We waiting a lot longer than normal for our food but the nice waitress we had thanked us again for our patience and brought us out another loaf of bread to nibble on while we waited for our food. The have a clam chowder soup my husband gets and he says it's the best he has had. My husband got the talipia plate and he enjoyed his food he said it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My chopped steak was disappointing for the first time, it was way over cooked and was a little burnt on the bottom i ate it because i didn't want to have to wait for a new one and also i was appreciative of what they were doing for the vets. I will visit again becasue i think they were just having trouble keeping up due to the volume of people there. When we finished our meal the waitress brought us our bill for my food the drinks and my husbands soup and thanked him for his service which was very nice.

Our soup, salad and appetizers were all delivered at the same time, which made us feel rushed once again.  The hibachi chef came over to our table shortly after and made our food to perfection. (Best part of the experience)
We were barely In the middle of our meal when the server dropped our check without even asking whether or not we would like another drink or dessert. 
I think the worst part of the whole experience was when 5 buss boys & a manager hovered over our table waiting for us to get up. 
I confronted the manager about feeling rushed, he said "we are very busy" I looked around to see Nobody waiting... hummm. This was not a good experience what so ever!"}

I have also lived in Japan for 4 years and know my Japanese food.  

Just to let you know before you read.  This place is not an actual Japanese restaurant, at least when it comes to the regular dining.  They have Japanese dishes, but it more Chinese and Korean if anything. Most of the people I saw working there were Chinese. I did not see a single Japanese person which had me concerned about the food in the beginning.

For starters when we walked and was asked if we would like Hibachi or regular dining.  I said Hibachi, then the waiter left for a quick moment and came back with the manager.  The manager (older Chinese lady) said while walking to us no you can't sit in at the Hibachi table. I felt very disrespected at the tone of her voice. I asked her how long the wait would be she said 40 minutes.  I said regular dining was fine then.  We sat down and the service from then on was fine.

Now on to the food,
We ordered Gyoza and Yakitori chicken for appetizers and my daughter (5yrs old) wanted the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  The Gyoza was deep fried which is fine, but had very little taste.  The Yakitori was 3 pieces of white meat chicken (it didn't specify it was white meat on the menu) on stick x3 and it was slightly dry and and no taste even with the sauce on it.  For a Japanese restaurant to serve white meat Yakitori is hard to find. Typically in Japanese culture it is dark meat chicken.

The Shrimp Tempura Udon
The Shrimp comes on the side which the waitress told us.  The Shrimp Tempura was okay nothing to brag about.  The Udon noodles were overcooked and way too soft.  The Broth was very sweet, not salty or any meat taste for a Japanese broth.  When my I take my daughter to eat she eats all her noodles. She ate 4 bites and said she didn't want anymore. which has never happened. 

I ordered the combination Yakisoba and White Tiger Sushi Roll.
The Yakisoba came out and I saw instantly that the noodles used were chow mien noodles (a medium fat noodles) not actual a noodles used in Japanese Yakisoba (a skinny type noodle).  The Yakisoba was very sweet like the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  I couldn't finish it and asked the waitress to take it away.  They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else I told them no.  The White Tiger Roll was very small.  The roll was about 3/4 an inch High maybe.  I was very disappointed in the size of the rolls.  The fish was not fresh and they used a lot of spice to try and cover it up.

Overall I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I had to return part of my meal because the only thing Japanese about the dining area was the names on the menu.  Some things are priced too high for what they are, and the food was not good at all. The best thing I had, was the water."}

We went twice before and they wouldn't seat us because it was a few before closing which is understandable I guess. 

They have boca burgers to sub any beef patty, which is nice. My fiancé and I both went with burgers that night and they were awesome. And the fries? I could have just ate two servings of those they were so good! Our server wasn't anything special, not very conversationally or concerned with the turn out of our meal. Nor we're the other servers.

He wasn't even talking much. Especially with a table with 3 different families with children. The main concern here and reason I'm writing this is because he forgot our son's shrimp that we ordered. He still had the grill on cooking vegetables and he couldn't even bother to get some more fresh shrimp to cook up for him but instead he cut up the few pieces of shrimp he set aside on the grill to save for after so that he can toss it into people's mouths. He served those 4 pieces of shrimp to my 4 yr old son he forgot to serve, after it's been sitting on the grill. He did not even apologize and the manager seemed like he could care less. They did take off our son's meal off our bill but that is not the point. He could've handled that better. He managed to serve 11 other people and couldn't even serve our son after realizing HIS mistake. We are regulars at the flamingo location and never had a bad experience until now. This location has very bad customer service."}

My party of 2 wanted to dine al fresco, so we headed to the patio and were told a table was opening up. As we went to the table, another server told us that someone will get to you eventually, or something to that effect. It was packed on the patio, and we saw that the servers were rushing around. 

O and MG, no one stopped by our table for about 20 minutes, so we gave up and went to sit at the bar. Things did improve after that, luckily! We got our drinks pretty quick and were finally able to order. We had 2 appetizers- the spinach/artichoke dip and breaded lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was delicious, and the dip not so much. It was not hot and needed more flavor. My meal of simply grilled mahi was pretty good, although the sauce could've been tastier.
My dining partner really enjoyed the steak and shrimp entree. Our server/bartender was pretty good about checking on us and did mention something like they didn't expect such a crowd that night, which didn't make sense to me. I learned my lesson about trying to dine on the patio, for sure!"}

I had to sit at the hibachi table.  Amazing food and show for great price.  Our Chef Jason kept us laughing.  He is quite the showman.  Best onion volcano!  He was engaging and required crowd participation.

We usually avoid appetizers because we always leave so full and that was definitely the case here that night. Our entrees came with choice of soup or salad. I chose chicken tortilla and the babe had clam chowder. The winner was the chowder. Very good. Mine was good too but not equally delicious. The babe had beef ribs and I had beef tips with mushrooms atop mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Can't remember the name of the dish. The beef ribs were huge. They could have been more tender but we really enjoyed them. I wasn't a fan of my dish too much because it had so much Rosemary in the sauce but the beef was very tender and the veggies were really good. The service was great and I liked the log cabin decor inside. Made it very cozy. I would definitely come back when in the mood for comfort food the ambiance is nice and the service even better.

They just comped our whole anniversary dinner (like $81 bucks) because we had a couple of issues. Tasha ordered a Hawaii Tai and it had a piece of Glass (we think it came from the rum bottle so they told us) in it (she did not cut herself). Then we thought ok free drinks, discount on food maybe? We weren't mad, we just didn't want anything else with ice in it. So they brought out this bomb red wine with a slightly obscene French name (menage a something) 

Then when Tasha's Surf and Turf came out my mashed potatoes were ice cold because Tasha's meal took longer to cook. They apologized profusely, brought me new sides, a red velvet happy anniversary cupcakes, and a huge slice of six layer chocolate cake and extra garlic Texas cheese toast comped the whole meal gave Happy Anniversary wishes and begged us to come back again so they can make things perfect. Best service & recovery I have experienced in years (like 7). I was not expecting all of that! 

All and all when they fixed our issues the food was amazing and the service and the recovery more than made up for our two, "Uhhh what's this?" moments. I will be back again. Thanks guys for making our 9 year anniversary memorable in an awesome way because this could have played out very, very differently. Not the perfect experience, but the absolute perfect effort."}

My father in law is a big fan of hibachi style restaurants so we thought we'd give this a shot instead of Benihana.

First off, the prices are reasonable and the way that the menu is set up allows everyone, regardless of your budget, the opportunity to partake in Hibachi. We each ordered the typical hibachi (soup, salad, vegetables, rice) with 2 meats for about $25. It is plenty of food too.

The food was delicious! I ordered the salmon and shrimp and could not have been happier. Dad ordered the chicken and steak and he was pleased too. We also got an order of the dragon roll and the volcano roll. I HIGHLY recommend the dragon roll. But both were fantastic.

For those that love hibachi, the show can sometimes get boring. It's the same onion volcano and egg roll every time. But not here. Our chef was HILARIOUS and tried out a lot of new stuff that kept us on our toes. We did sake shots as a table and it was a good time. Seriously, the best chef I've seen.

We will be back soon!"}

Luckily we had a reservation. It seemed they were short handed on Hibachi chefs, but, no problem. We didn't get in a real big rush. We just took our time and enjoyed. Our chef Ken was wonderful. It made it fun to watch and great to eat. 5 People with appetisers and full dinners was only $125 with tip. 3 of us had the filet mignon. 
The service was fast and well done. Thank you for a great evening."}

My friend and I ate here for lunch today, we explained that we were on our lunch hour and were pressed for time.  The host suggested we eat in bar for faster service.  Since it was such a beautiful day out we decided to eat outside.  

The service was extremely SLOW!! I felt that we were forgotten about, when I finally received my Burger it had paper in it, apparently they did not take the paper off the cheese and I ate part of it.  The server told me it was ok because it was just paper, she grabbed a manager who told me the same thing.  I argued that it was not ok, no one should eat paper!  

The manager told me she would replace it with soup or a salad, I told her forget it I was only on lunch and I would stop somewhere on the way back to work to get a burger at a fast food place, my friend said "no they can just make you another one"  and the manager just looked at us....she was not prepared I guess to give us another burger?!  Weird.....she disappeared for about 15 minutes, but we could see her walking around in the bar area, when she came back out she actually lied and said she cooked it herself....kind of difficult to make a burger in the kitchen when you are in the bar!"}

First of all, 5 stars for location. Love having a cool place in walking distance.
Second, I really like what they've done with the décor - it's definitely upgraded from the old Pumi days, with a smaller sushi bar in back, and a larger "bar" bar in front.
Third, the food. There are the Sohos and the Yonakas and the Yojies of the Southwestern Vegas world, but we didn't really have any inventive Japanese places in the Southeast...until now! We had tuna carpaccio (yum), suzukiana (or something - halibut....super yum), Bluefin tuna (awesome), a raw beef dish (medium good...but at least it was really huge), and the screaming o (typically not my style, but I ordered with the sauce on the side and just dipped it and it was really good). Oh yeah and the salmon nachos (good. Served on a pringle!). Food was excellent.
Prices are reasonable. For all that, plus edamame and a bottle of really good sake, it was about $120. Hibachi meals start around $18 I think.
Overall, we'll definitely be back, with the kids."}

Initially, we had planned to go to another sushi restaurant but read the reviews for this place. 
First impression of the place was really nice. The restaurant is split into two sections: the hibachi tables and booths on the side. They also have a bar up front as well. 
The menu offered a great deal of options. However if you want hibachi, you have to sit at the hibachi tables. 
My brother and I ended up going with the Ohjah Boat, which includes your choice of 3 special rolls, 12 pieces of sashimi, and 10 pieces of nigiri. The sashimi and the nigiri are chef's choice. I was initially sad that I couldn't pick certain nigiri; however, the presentation and quality of the fish really pushed my rating to 5 stars. The fish pieces were fatty and well portioned when it came to the rice to fish ratio. Also the sushi rolls were great (my brother and I chose the Black Widow, Tsunami, and volcano roll). My personal favorite was the Black Widow. Besides the boat, we also got 2 orders of eel nigiri and a salmon Kama. All of which were cooked perfectly and delicious. The service was also excellent. Our server frequently checked up on us and gave us suggestions when we had difficulty choosing options. 
I would definitely recommend coming to this place. It's decently priced for a place that does a la carte. Will definitely come back but to try the hibachi next time!"}

I ate here for the first time yesterday night (1/10/17) and I was super excited. I had garlic edamame, cucumber and avocado rolls, and an order of the spicy chicken. This is the LAST time I will ever eat here, as I have been violently throwing up all night/morning long since I got back home. My best bet is that the spicy chicken was not thoroughly cooked. I shared the dish with my boyfriend and he also got sick as well. Beware eating any chicken products here, or anything that requires cooking of any kind. I have never been so sick from something that came from a semi-upscale restaurant before. Never coming here again."}

My friend lives by this location and invited me out for a bday celebration. Well it started off great and Jason was entertaining. When it came down to the cooking it went down fast. A lady was vegetarian and kept advising him to not add egg in her rice and to use a separate utensil but he was drunk and kept forgetting. I'm not exaggerating he had like 4 sake bombs just at our table and he had a cup he kept drinking from. One of the other patrons actually commented on it and Jason said it was "tea" lol sure. But I digress. He was talking so much while making the rice he forgot about the vegetarian no egg in rice and my fiance and I noodles. he didn't even stir them once. he literally threw them on the grill and tossed them our plate a while after. they were dry, over cooked, and tasteless. I was livid as I could see where this was going. Hibachi isn't crazy expensive but it's not cheap either. I expect quality food at that price point. Anyways, I ask him to remake our noodles in a low tone and just so he could here. I wasn't trying to make a big deal but I wanted edible noodles. Well he made 3-4 lippy comments and by 3 or 4 I replied with an even more snippy response. I'm beyond irritated at this point. First he says while making my noodles that usually people tell him how they want their noodles in the beginning. Mind you there noodles expecting them to not be over cooled and have flavor shouldn't be deemed a preference more so a standard(this is what I was thinking but I didn't say it). Second time he puts the raw noodle on my plate and say this is how they come out. third thing, he makes a scene, while placing the noodles on my plate he says no one has ever said anything about . y noodles before and involves another patron at the table who was acknowledged as his friend. and start to pick at me as of I was being difficult. At this point I respond and advise the chef well I'm a regular at another location I know how noodles are suppose to taste and these aren't it. He made a couple more jabs. By the end he ordered like 3 more meats and looked around the table confused about who got what and started piling food on everyone's plate and to finish off the night you guessed it another sake bomb. He was obviously intoxicated. I will never go to this location again. I'm very upset I spent $90 on food I took home and threw away. The only salvageable food was the lobster and that was because I literally walked him through cooking it. I told him when to take it off and how much garlic n butter etc. Overall horrible experience. Maybe well most likely a different chief would have yielded a better experience."}

The last thing Sushi Cafe is, is just another sushi joint. Bento Cafe? Sushi burrito Cafe? Lunch box Cafe? Poki Cafe? All of those would bring more people in and would better describe their menu. 
I think the highlight of Sushi Cafe is their Protein Box lunches. Rice, veggies, seaweed salad, korokke, egg and your choice of meat = Protein box. The Monster Box includes a giant sushi burrito and 5 pieces of sushi. SUCH a good deal AND they serve it in those cute brown boxes and not styrofoam- yippeee! 
I've had the fried white fish and the chicken protein box.
Fried white fish: I was a little worried at first (it looked like the frozen fish sticks you can buy), but they were far from it. There was plenty of fish in it and it tasted GOOD. I loved it, but for me, having fried fish and also fried korokke in the box was a little too much fry for me. It put me into a food coma way too fast. 
Chicken protein box: yes, yes, yes. So much chicken! The sauce is in a container on the side so you don't have to be worried about it being drenched in teriyaki. 

The sushi bento boxes were another story. 
The quality of the nigiri was HORRIBLE and the giant rolls were pretty bad. The salmon in my roll was so tough I couldn't bite through it. It was like chewing on rubber- a couple of bites of that and I had to spit it out. It was easily the worst piece of fish I've ever had. I would not recommend ordering anything with raw fish from here. 

There is no AC in Sushi Cafe................................ I wouldn't recommend eating here, just taking out on your lunch break or on your way home. They also have some Japanese snacks, drinks (Calpis, etc) for sale and cup noodle with a hot water machine as well."}

This is great for lunch or dinner. The owners are very nice and welcoming. The inside is nice and clean, so no complaint there.

They do not have waiters or waitresses, to help keep overhead costs down, & with what they save they are able to buy you Fresh grade sushi right from a Japanese Vendor, & (let's not kid ourselves) who knows fish better than those who created "Sushi?" ...when one eats sushi, 1st question you should ask restaurant is, "where do you get your fish?" ...very important question, to avoid Mercury, food poisoning, etc! Oh, & they cater too!!!

I was a bit thrown off by how we order. I thought they'd sit you first but you have to order first, and if you're eating "for here", they'll tell you to sit and they bring your food to you, then you pay when you're done eating. The only menu I saw were boards on the wall so it was hard to see what I was ordering. There were just names and I didn't know what was in any of the rolls. I had to depend on Yelp (thank you!). 

Service was great, though! The cashier/waitress was very friendly. The wait for our food wasn't too bad either. 

I ordered a combo bowl. I was hesitant about the price (~$12) but when I saw what was actually included in my bowl, I understood why. I got raw salmon, spicy tuna, surimi crab, seaweed salad, masago, avocado, ginger, rice, some greens, and probably other things that were hidden under everything else. I enjoyed by food and was happy to be bringing home leftovers. 

The price for a roll is pretty affordable and two rolls can fill you up. I'd definitely come here for rolls if I don't want to spend so much on AYCE. ~$4.50 for nigiri may be pushing it, so I'll probably do AYCE somewhere else for that."}

After giving it a chance, I'm thoroughly impressed and much happier than I would have been at the other place. It'll be my definite go-to place for quick and good quality food, plus the friendly service is a bonus. 
They also sell some authentic Asian desserts/snacks and drinks like cheesecake, pocky, calpico, tea, and hello panda. 
I will definitely come back for more!"}

Right when I walked in, I already felt comfortable seeing lounge couches included as the dining seats. I had to take up this area good for 4 persons at a table. They have a back patio decor combined with Asian accents. Lighting is great along with the fixtures. I see that they have a sushi bar not in use and they should install bar stools along the counter. They can open up that concept to make the experience personal with the sushi chef.  

I took a picture of the menu, so you could find it in the photos to pick out your options. 

Personally, I ordered the Bulgogi Box $9.00 which comes complete with rice, seaweed salad and tamago. I also added a shrimp tempura appetizer. 

My friends all did sushi roll orders that start at $5.95 

The owner of the cafe complimented our lunch with a free waffle mochi ice cream w/ red bean paste and strawberry syrup toppings. He made our experience feel like top class!"}

Walking in, my sis and I thought you walk up to the counter to order, so we sat our stuff down at a table. The gal working the counter quickly approached us with menus and said she would be right with us. She was helping some people standing by the counter (they were reading the wall menus). We ordered a beef bulgogi box which came with rice, seaweed salad, tamago and pickled veg. Also with our order was a miso soup, tuna poke and poke bowl (half ahi and half white fish). I felt like the bulgogi was a little on the dry side and wasn't as flavorful as other bulgogi dishes I've had in the past. I believe the tuna poke, for the price, was lacking in amount. The quality of the fish was excellent! The miso soup was basic and satisfying and the poke bowl was huuuuuuge. Yummy and HUGE. Just a heads up, the poke bowl came with a set variation of toppings and sauce. I'm sure it could be customizable, but I didn't bother to ask. I didn't mind, everything about that poke bowl was perfection! PS, skip the edamame."}

He is super picky like me but I knew we would find some stuff we both liked. When we walked in there was only one person who had ordered takeout. It was on a Monday around 2pm. The host was very welcoming and told us to sit where ever we liked. We took our seats and started looking at the menu. They have a pretty good variety of items at a really decent price. Our waitress/host came back to take our drink order, we both ordered fountain drinks which we could have poured ourselves but she insisted on doing it for us. When she brought our drinks over she asked my brother to taste his because it looked flat. It was indeed so she instead brought him over a canned soda. I felt that was a step above what most places would do. We ended up ordering an appetizer and 4 rolls. Everything was absolutely amazing! The rolls were perfect and tasted so fresh. The service was great and the price could not be beat. In CA my husband and I had a place we would go to regularly and never left paying under $40 (not including tip) our order was pretty similar to what my brother and I ordered here. The price we paid at Sushi Cafe was only $22.95 (again not including tip) that is a huge price difference for basically the same meal! I am totally going to bring my husband here!

Now to serious business. The deep fried potato thingy is so crunchy and delicious! Yesterday i took my mom there. She had a box and really liked it. I had for the first time a tuna bowl. This is seriously the BEST tuna bowl ever. No joke. I felt it was very spicy. But itms me, i cant handle spicy. But it didnt matter i ate it all. It was huge. This guys don't disappoint. Everything i had so far has been excellent! The other day i had one meal that was like a burrito and it was delicious. 
One thing i love is that is very casual.

The fried rice was light and full of flavor, and at the same time was not too oily.  The gyoza was cooked the right way and made on site, which was easy to tell by the balance of sight, texture and flavor. Hands down the best gyoza I've had at a restaurant in Vegas.

We were looking for something light for dinner to grab and take home last night. I have had this on my list and sushi is light so this was the winner.

My first impression is that the restaurant is very clean and simple. The employee working at the counter greeted us immediately. He gave us a paper menu to look at and help us decide what to order since we were obviously there for the first time.

Our order came up in about five minutes which I thought was fast for a walk in order. Everything was packaged nicely and they even included napkins, silverware, chopsticks, and soy sauce. 

All of the rolls we ordered were very good and fresh. They were notably better than other sushi I've had recently. The Lemon Roll was my favorite and the lemon added a great twist to the flavor. The Shrimp Tempura Roll was delicious and had plenty of crunchy topping. The Mexican Roll had the perfect amount of avocado on top and the right amount of heat. My edamame wasn't very tender and not my favorite item. The Green Tea Cheesecake sounded interesting, but was not my cup of tea, pun intended. There was nothing wrong with the cheesecake, it just wasn't my thing.

The menu definitely offers more than just rolls so I'm excited to return and try more of the menu items."}

We'd been here before, but it seems many things have changed.

Their menu is basically useless. There are no descriptions at all about what is in the dishes/rolls. And, unfortunately, our server's mastery of English was not good enough to explain what was in the food. They've also listed some roll names on their chalkboards, but again, no explanation of what they are and no prices.

Ultimately, our food was just okay. There are other restaurants nearby with equal or better quality food where you know exactly what you are ordering. Unless they fix this critical problem I think Sushi Cafe might be in for tough times ahead."}

The food here is really good! They're focus is somewhat healthier versions of US sushi. Def not the most traditional food, but quite tasty. The owners/staff were really friendly and took their time explaining their food and concept and went out of their way to be welcoming overall. 

   As I'm not a huge raw-fish fan, I went with the spicy pork bento, an order of gyoza, and an order of edamame (I was in a large group and intended to share some gyoza and edamame). Everything was quite tasty! I really enjoyed the pork, though it could have been spicier, and the rice was really good too! It's a mix of white and brown and topped with furikake. The meal also came with a few pickles, a small seaweed salad, and a gorokke (croquette). Their croquette is again, intended to be lighter, and is mixed with kabocha for a sweeter taste, rather than having a sauce. The gyoza also came without a sauce, but I found on both parts I wasn't quite missing anything. 

   The only kinda of negatives to watch out for, are that this place does all of its plating in to-go boxes. While this is super easy for a quick lunch or post-work out dinner, it may not be the most special date-night, if you're looking for something fancy. Also, the edamame are only lightly salted, not coated in the rock salt in used to. It's still really tasty, just not what I was expecting. Also, they don't have a liquor license, so no after-class beer and edamame at this time, which is probably better for my waist line anyway.

Overall a great little place. It's definitely going to be my new Friday night after-class hangout!"}

In Henderson and is specializing in the quick, casual, Asian style cafe. So far, it's only been open for a couple of days, and after trying it out, it's a decent place to go for a quick meal.

Sushi Cafe is right about next to Henry's American Grill. It's a small little shop, but is bright, clean, and very well maintained. It has a modern feel. After being explained the concept, I was intrigued.

This place is going for the fast, casual eatery. They are going for various boxes which include meats, seafood, and other items. They are also going for a different style of food where they are pairing some Asian ingredients with panini's. You can also order nigiri and sushi rolls by themselves. I ordered a monster box, which included a roll, and 4pcs of nigiri.

I ordered the Korean BBQ roll box which came with 4pcs of nigiri. I thought it was alright. Nothing stood out in bad way. It was a quick casual meal and how I thought would be expected. It was a decent meal.

Originally, I was going to give the food here 3.5 stars, but I rounded up with the really great service and value for what I received. Definitely different when it comes to their contemporaries like Zupas and Panera, but different in a good way."}

They definitely need to have more Asian food around this area and the popularity of Sushi Cafe is a good indicator of that.

I have tried the shrimp monster combo, bulgolgi combo, and the poke bowl (I almost spelled Pokeball instead...but there is a Pokestop nearby so farm away while waiting/eating!). 

Shrimp monster combo is my go to for takeout whenever I am craving for some sushi. For about $11, you get 5 pieces of nigiri, a croquette, and a shrimp tempura california roll style burrito. It is a bunch of food which can easily be enough for 2 meals. I highly recommend trying this if you don't know what you want lol. I did notice that the veggies they use in the burrito does vary at times (a low point was when they gave me a bunch of iceberg lettuce) so just be aware of that. 

The bulgolgi combo is pretty good as well. It comes with bulgolgi (duh), rice, seaweed salad, a croquette, and pickled onions(?). I decided to get this set since I wanted to try something besides the sushi and I wasn't disappointed. The only thing is that the meat portion seems small compared to how much rice you get. Also, the seaweed salad didn't taste as fresh as other places I have been to, but it isn't too bad. 

I got the Poke bowl here since I never had one, and figured it would be appropriate to try it here. You do get a ton of fish and can choose from veggies or salad. I opted for the salad option since I wanted a healthier option. The only gripe I have about this dish is they really drenched it with a lot of sauce. There was a bunch of flavor, but I got kinda sick halfway through my meal since my dish was literally swimming in the sauce lol...I'm not sure if it is like this in other places so I will have to update this post once I get more experience with this dish. 

This is a must try place if you are in the area!"}

I took the sushi back to the hotel where my son and husband devoured it.  The review of the spicy tuna was that it was delicious and actually spicy.  (Too many times at other places 'spicy' tuna rolls are anything but spicy.)  The california roll was devoured without a word - so that's a plus, because it was a very picky eater eating it.

My only negative is that I had some fatty meat in the bulgogi box.  Granted, bulgogi will have fatty pieces, but there was one piece that I actually couldn't eat.  It wasn't bad enough to drop the star rating down to four, but thought I'd mention it. 

Overall, everything was delicious, fresh and ready fast!  When a restaurant is as clean as Sushi Cafe, it gives a person confidence that the food prep area is kept clean.

If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely come back again.

*Side note* For a taste of something unique, try the Korean Nongshim (brand) shrimp crackers in the front.  These are hugely popular in Korea.  For me, I think they're nasty, but I don't like shrimp. ;)  (They're actually like chips and not crackers in the US traditional sense.)"}

In addition the food was truly delicious. The rules are the best. We highly advocate for the  shrimp tempura roll and my absolute diehard favorite which was the Philadelphia roll.   The edamame and the seaweed salad was also delicious.  The Edamame beans were perfect with some delicious kosher sea salt.   

You will not be disappointed.  If your experience will be anything like ours, you'll be very glad you came. We were here at 8 PM and didn't feel rushed even though it was the end of the day.

Options include Poke bowls, Sushi burritos, a variety of Sushi Rolls and Nigiri. The Bento Box options are Bulgogi, Fried Fish, Tempura and more. The straightforward menu is very refreshing."}

I ate here two times, the first time I had the bbq Korean box and a shrimp tempura roll. The first time I ordered a Korean BBQ bento box and it was good, the meat was very tender and had  great sauce . The second time the meat was inedible, their was no sauce and the meat quality was downright horrible. I like to give everyone a chance but this place is going to have to step up if they are going to make it in this transit town. Their menu needs to be more descriptive. I didn't dare order something I had no idea of what it was. Their are too many sushi spots in town to have low quality sushi. The prices are good because your not getting the top quality, I would compare their sushi rolls to supermarkets like Smiths/Albertsons. You need to be consistent to stay in business as a new business, 

Their are plenty of sushi spots in the Valley but most are average. I hope this place gets their act together as far as their quality in meat goes or else they won't make it out here :/"}

If you want sushi or you feel like having beef, chicken, pork or some poke, this brand new quick service restaurant is it! 

Fast/Casual style...so order and pay at the register first.  Eco-friendly...Your orders are nicely presented in portable containers. Perfect go-to lunch spot for the nearby office and city workers who just want grab-n-go service. 

--Food--
Sushi, Meats,Salads, Soups and Green Tea Cheesecake are what is on the menu.

Since I cant have sushi, meat is my option. This first visit, I ordered the "BOX".
You choose your protein (Bulgogi, Korean BBQ, Spicy Pork, Chicken or Poke)
-includes seaweed salad, tamago (sweet egg), goroke(kabocha/pumpkin squash) 
and a mix of brown and white rice.

Plus points for catering to the health conscious crowd. The meats are not sodium heavy, and marinated in lighter sauces. 

The goroke is awesome! Reminds me of a croquette but Japanese style with healthy pumpkin squash, covered in panko crust and pan fried....yumm!! And Chef said you can order them off the appetizer section too! 

The tamago egg was surprisingly light too. Seaweed salad and rice were also seasoned nicely. My whole meal was pretty light but filling and  delish!

--Ambiance--
Small and informal restaurant, like cafes are supposed to be. 
You can dine in and chill at the sushi counter or at the tables along the wall. 
The transformation from the previous cheesesteak place is a huge improvement!  Lots of sweat equity went into this place. The tables were made and set up by the owner and chefs themselves. They even put in flooring and new paneling on the walls.  I've seen this place go thru 3 different changes, and this one is one of the nicest change.

Friendly, down-to-earth guys! They were so nice to take time out to answer questions about their menu and culinary background(I know, I'm so nosy). 20+ years classically trained French and Sushi chefs, worked from the ground up.  They know their stuff. I can't wait to try the specials they feature. Looking forward to that French Onion soup too.  

--Location--
Stephanie/American Pacific Parkway - Yup, close by the DMV...Your visual cue is the Auto Zone on Stephanie, restaurant is on the same end as Henry's and Roberto's.

--Summary--
Casual, quick, healthier choices, pretty good food, reasonable prices, eco-friendly, I'd say is a winning concept. More visits in the future, especially since they are open late!"}

The White Fish box was plenty of food for one, with two planks of fried fish on a bed of cabbage, with the rice and sides of seaweed salad, pickled veggies, tamago and some sort of sweet potato croquette? I liked everything enough to grab a takeout lemon roll for my guy, who inhaled it and assured me the fish was fresh.

Good addition to the area, focusing on fast lunch should make them a hit with the nearby office parks or for those visiting the nearby DMV. Props for giving this area another healthy option!"}

Since I left DFW I've been trying to find somewhere to fill the void Sushi Robata left in my soul. Sushi Cafe comes damn close. 

The prices are the best I've seen pretty much ever, I think. The menu isn't huge, but it covers the bases. ALSO IMO KOROKKE. It's so hard to find anywhere that does korokke at all, much less somewhere that does them... better than Robata?! The potatoes are so buttery and smooth, and the panko is done well too. The korokke comes with a mysterious orange sauce here, no idea what it's called. It's like a spicy mayo but with a little more heft to it. 

I got the crunch shrimp tempura roll and the red dragon roll. My only criticism is that the eel sauce on the red dragon roll was a little heavy handed, but not a big deal at all. It did leak over into my tempura roll, but whatever. 

They also have some desserts in a fridge case - matcha cheesecake and castella cake, which is basically a sponge cake. The castella is packaged in two slices of slightly different appearance, and I'm not sure of the difference. There's also some instant ramen bowls available, like Shin Bowl, and the odd matcha Pocky and Hi-Chew sorts of snacks. 

Another reviewer mentioned getting ill after having their order delivered. I noticed at the end of my tempura roll, after it had cooled down a bit, that something did taste a little iffy with the room-temperature tempura combined with the eel sauce. If you're getting delivery (and this applies to any sushi place in my opinion), make sure all the sauces are on the side, and don't get anything meant to be eaten piping hot. The korokke might be okay since potatoes hold heat well, but I'd keep the sushi to the cold-only variations."}

Last weekend, after arriving in town, I learned my brother was also in Vegas for a friend's wedding. We decided to meet near where he was staying, which is how we all ended up at the Sushi Cafe in Henderson. Naturally, he previewed the restaurant and noticed it had really good reviews. Considering he lives in San Francisco and loves sushi, this was all the convincing I needed.

The Sushi Cafe is in an interesting location in a strip mall, and it's nicely decorated. Right away, our group felt very comfortable in a clean, modern dining room that was nearly half full. Our server was very kind and took the time to answer our questions. I regret that I don't remember her name.

Most of those in our group chose either the Bulgogi or Spicy Pork boxes. My brother took his own road and selected the Dragon Roll and Edamame. Everyone present enjoyed their meals. And my verdict is this: These are the BEST pot stickers I have ever tried, anywhere!

The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm getting off the freeway at the Stephanie Street exit. Thank you!"}

We ordered to go last night.  I ordered the Monster BBQ box and  hubby ordered the sashimi salad.

My BBQ BOX
-The calbi rolls were not good.  The meet was so chewy, that instead of wasting it, I gave it to Dolce, my adorable doggie.  She seems to love it, unfortunately, I am the one writing the review.
-The 4 piece nigiri are: shrimp, tuna, salmon, and another piece of I don't remember as they were all not good grade as they were chewy as well.  Didn't give this to Dolce as I don't know how she will react to this.
-The potato croquettes were yummy though.
-Seaweed salad - decent

Hubby's Sashimi Salad - not the traditional slices of sashimi you would find at other Sushi restaurant...they just topped the greens with poke style sashimi.  We didn't dig it very much.

Conclusion:  Fast take out place, but we will not be ordering from here again."}

Just a tip - their rice seems to be a blend of a little bit of brown rice. Perhaps a little bit on the healthier side?"}

I came in for lunch to give it a try! It's tucked in a plaza so you have to look carefully while driving around the parking lot. 

Upon entering, to the left was a huge chalkboard that listed their box specials, and the cashier gave us a paper menu to look at. 

I decided to go with the Salmon burrito box special. I am pretty picky about what I like and don't like to eat, and I specified that I would like to have half salmon and half tuna, with crab mix, spicy mayo, and eel sauce. She told me that all of that would be added in there. However, when I received my burrito there wasn't any crab mix. 

The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the food is actually pretty good for what you're paying. For $10, I got a sushi burrito (it's probably the size of 3 eggrolls), and 5 pieces of sashimi and 2 gyoza. At first I thought it was an okay deal, but it turned out to be more than filling!

Knocking off one star for customer service because it took us over 20 minutes to get our food (most likely because of deep frying the gyoza), and the lack of explanation of the menu. But overall I would come back here for lunch when I am craving sushi. I'll just remember to call it in"}

It came with seaweed salad, sweet fried potatoes pieces, white fluffy rice, pickled garlic and what not and all for under $10.  

The sushi rolls, were not so good here for me.  I had the spicy tuna roll and was it an overload of sodium.  I guess they haven't gotten the mixture of spiciness against the salt ratio down pack. It was major turn off, so it made the rest of my perception of this place go from oh I can totally do this drive for this food to never mind.  I can't imagine what their poke would taste like if they can't even mix spicy tuna.  The up side to it all, the fish is good and the price is probably a pretty good price point.  The sushi rolls weren't good at all, but the nigiri such hamachi, tuna and salmon weren't bad for $2.95 a set.  

For me, the box all the way if I would come back for a 3rd visit."}

We ended up switching our main dishes ourselves because we like each other's better. I love the scrambled egg and the avocado the most. What is interesting is that the famous coffee cake in this restaurant isn't really a coffee cake as it doesn't have coffee flavor.

Coffee was $2.65 - and was pretty bad. In part, I didn't discover until my second cup. The "creamers" on the table are actually "non-dairy" in disguise!

So, if you want real milk or cream -you have to ask for it (which they don't tell you!!)

What upset me the most was my waffle. It was a good waffle and their syrup decent - however, for $7 for just a small round waffle (no, no extras just the waffle).

You would think the large cup of what looked like whipped butter would be perfect.

Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. It was a large cup of whipped ... fake something. I'm thinking canola oil but not sure - I am 100% sure it was not in any way butter!

When I nicely mentioned it at check out after spending $25 on breakfast - I got two smirks with a promise they'd pass it on.

So, I'm not the only one that's commented on it. New management needed before you go bust.

So many other places to go for breakfast for a fraction of the price."}

The glaring failure with this place is their absolute inability to correctly put together a to go order.  I say inability, because there can't be any other explanation for their 100% failure rate. I can only assume that there is some kind of medical condition plaguing the staff that prohibits them from grasping the concept of checking an order before they hand it off. 

I work in an office across from this place, and I have literally had this problem dozens of times. Every time I think, "Ya know self, it's been awhile, maybe they have some new people in there now, maybe this time will be the time they don't suck". Nope.

It's decent at best. I'll give you the rundown. 

First: If you come here on a weekend, expect a wait time. My husband and I had to wait 10 minutes for a seat, which honestly isn't terrible...but still meh. There are cool little stores nearby to kill a few minutes in.

Service: The service was good. That was one thing I enjoyed about the place. Our server was ready to recommend items and substitutes for entrees at the drop of a hat. In fact we saved a little money from it. BONUS!

Price: This area made me sad. You get a lot of food, yes, but everything was overpriced. I got a Joes scramble which was about 10 dollars. I could have made it at home for a fraction of the price. Their coffee is 2.25 for a cup. OUCH. I'm used to being kind of tight with my money, so everything on the menu made my wallet cry. Especially since you can make a lot of it at home.

Quality: The quality of the food was good. On par to what you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. The portions are good and everything is well cooked. The eggs are fluffy and the potatoes weren't overcooked. 

Overall: It was a decent experience but once was more then enough for me. There are other places to go for a good breakfast and that cost half as much. I suggest going there once to try it and judge yourself."}

It's been in my to-do list on my phone for a while now, pulled from some Yelp list that hasn't really brought me any real treats yet. Most people's recommendations and opinions for food are typically below my expectations, but someone has to come through right? Looks like I might have to keep going on that list.

The Cracked Egg is in a typical local strip mall and blends in with everything else from the outside like the rest of our mundane suburban locations. The inside is very open, pretty loud and not that fancy. Some breakfast themed restaurants have a slightly cozier feel than this, but in no means is it uninviting or that bad.

This restaurant is really a breakfast place, and the menu reflects that all the way; you have the full gamut of breakfast choices but I'm sure way better than anything you'd find at an IHOP. The burger options make up a very small section of the menu, with only a few choices that seem like typical offerings for a menu like this.

I went with a mushroom and Swiss burger to once again sample a baseline offering, as they don't really give you the option for a stand-out feature burger. What you're given is a pretty standard looking plate with a good sized burger, pickle wedge, lots of onion, a very large piece of lettuce and some oddly seasoned fries. The seemingly pre-made (not hand-made) patty was thin, yet juicy. It had ok flavor, but wasn't really cooked medium as I had asked. The bun was a bit thin, and made me nervous based on how juicy the burger was, but still held up through to the end. The mushrooms and Swiss both had good flavor and were welcome toppings, whereas my giant hunk of lettuce was a bit much.

As I said before, the fries had an odd seasoning on them I can't quite place. They were just ok, not that fresh and not too crispy. Overall the meal was just ok, depending on how much of a factor you consider the fries to be I don't have too much to complain about, but it just wasn't that great overall. At $8.95 it's not a horrible price, but I've had far better from some other less-than-fancy places lately that were even cheaper. If you're a breakfast lover I'm sure you couldn't go wrong here, but if you're looking for a good cheap burger in Henderson, there are much better places."}

The spicier dishes (eg. anything with chorizo and or green chile) are too mild for my tastes, but like that there is the option to have something with some non-Anglo flair.

I knew I wanted some scrambled eggs but my rational mind opted for an omelette with vegetables, the Garden Patch.  It was a wrong choice as I was eyeing my friend's scrambled eggs the whole time.  Luckily I got to steal some and heavenly fluffy it was.  Don't get me wrong.  The Garden Patch omelette would have been a great hit if I were a rabbit.  Note to self - never put broccoli in an omelette.  Go for the hashbrown if you can.  If you get lucky, they'll brown it thoroughly and what you get will be a crunchy shreddy and starchy texture to play with in your mouth.  Definitely one of the funnest moments in my mouth."}

My friend ordered the Eggs Benny, which she said was good. The hash browns looked and were uncooked, but they were not greasy, so trade off. The eggs could have used slightly more hollandaise sauce, but our server was happy to bring more when asked. 
I ordered the Monte Cristo on the servers rec. I was considering the Eggs benny also. It was good but nothing to write about, truly. I would have liked the option being offered, on menu, of jam or syrup. I choose the seasoned potatoes. They were so NOT seasoned. They were barely salted, but hey, not too greasy also. They were also not too crunchy or crispy, lol. But I did eat them, so they were tasty after adding salt and pepper. They just were not what I expected to receive based on the word "Seasoned"

Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.  So I figured taking it in on a Sunday, at least I would be able to use the original amount towards my meal.  The server curtly told me that they would not accept it.  When I asked to see a manager, she came over with an attitude and refused to acknowledge my explanation or even listen to anything I wanted to say.  She kept repeating we will not take it.  I felt that she was incredibly rude and will unfortunately not return to this location because of her.  It is really unfortunate for me, because the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've eaten.  But I refuse to go to a restaurant where the management will not even listen to what I have to say.  I also feel that it would not have effected the store if she would have honored the original groupon price.  Thank goodness for me I can still go to Egg Works.  They have always treated me with respect and smiles."}

To add to the disappointing meal was the appearance and less than friendly staff. Employees do not have be overly happy but a fake smile would have helped.

My boyfriend and I basically go every Saturday...so with that being said, I was REALLY ASTOUNDED by what happened today...

BUGS IN OUR FOOD. THE FOOD-ON THE PLATE-EVERYWHERE.

My boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast, and I got one of the egg scrambles. All was fine, and then I saw a little brown bug crawling on the side of my boyfriend's plate. I looked closer, and saw literally 5 of them...and then more...I immediately told him to stop eating. We called our server over and she took the plate away. I then decided I couldn't eat because I was so insanely grossed out. The server then brought over our check and charged us for everything except my boyfriend's meal. I DIDN'T EVEN EAT MY MEAL (A FEW BITES) BECAUSE OF HOW DISGUSTED BY THE BUGS I WAS.

The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize or anything. The server just took my boyfriend's meal off the check and that was that. So my boyfriend decided to find the manager. After 5 minutes of searching the small restaurant for her, she came out and seemed ANNOYED to talk to him. She had a smug "don't care" attitude. My boyfriend is wayyyy too nice in my opinion...and the manager said that this is "the food industry and that bugs happen". !!!!!!!!!!!! What!!! management should never ever tell their patrons that. My boyfriend then asked her how she would feel if she had bugs in her food and her reply, "well, i grew up around animals so I wouldn't have cared." !!!!!!! What!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally after the manager made my boyfriend feel like an idiot for "politely" complaining, she said, "ok, if it'll make you happy, i'll take off your girlfriends meal too." That wasn't even it! It was the principle behind everything!!!!!!

I teach service recovery in the hospitality for a living and that was the most piss poor excuse of a manager I have ever encountered.

NEVER EVER going there again. I'm extremely disappointed."}

Where I haven't tried everything I am a big fan of the Veggie Benny. The dish is served on traditional English muffins, topped with tomatoes, poached eggs and avocado, smothered in hollandaise. Yet don't forget the Potatoes, these little squares, seem to be deep fried and seasoned yet not quite to perfection, but all the same they are good. I would say that the hollandaise could be thicker. But as a whole this restaurant has a menu with a wide range of traditional breakfast and lunch favorites. This wham bam breakfast joint, is a nice place to go with family and friends in a very relaxed environment, even appropriate for a quick breakfast or lunch for any business oriented outing. This location is definitely going to give the corporate chop shops, IHOP, Denny's, and the Original Pancake House a worthy competitor in the turf war that is breakfast. Surely The Cracked Egg has more of a local, friendly, and welcoming environment than its corporate competitors as well. Please stop by this restaurant and give it a shot.

Location- It's located right off of the 215 and green valley in the smith's strip mall building. Lots of parking and easy to find.

Ambience- It's clean and simply decorated. Very open with booths and a small counter area to eat at.

Service- Considering we were the only table here I did expect more. Our server was friendly enough and provided efficient service. Can't complain.

Food- We ordered the Monte Cristo w/ hash browns, The Carnitas omelet w/potatoes and blueberry coffee cake, and chocolate pancakes w/ side of bacon. We all shared the coffee cake. It was moist and fresh but we all agreed that the blueberries did not compliment the coffee cake. My son enjoyed his Monte Cristo but said he wouldn't eat it again. My omelet was dry, flat, and tasteless. I did expect so much more. Maybe my food choices wasn't the best, but it was recommended by the server. 

3 stars for being clean, decent service, having a great coffee cake recipe (subtract the blueberries), being reasonably priced, and having a good selection of items on the menu. It's not a bad place, it just wasn't for me."}

I love me some good customer service and she did a really good job.  The host/hostess were cool.  They clowned my GF for accidentally running into this baby, knocking her down, and making her cry.

For the food, the coffee cake was really good.  Careful though, I think they throw it in the microwave to heat it up a bit, so the filling gets a little hot.  Really good though.  My corned beef hash was OK.  Not bad, but not that exciting either.  GF ordered some kind of enchilada omelette that wasn't very good.  It wasn't gross, but it just lacked flavor all around.  It just tasted like egg and cheese, basically.  The potatoes were addicting, though.

Overall, I think I'd give it another shot and order something different.

The wait for a table was 5-10 mins which I thought was good, considering they were slammed with a bunch of families.  

Once being seated I read the menu thoroughly, just so I would get something I liked rather than something I'd hate.  After a good 5 mins our waitress came out and gave us our drinks, she then returned later to take our order.  I thought that her knowledge about the food was a little less than pleasing.  I asked about the holladaise sauce and she didn't know hot describe it other than it was yellow. Hmmmm, I wasn't too please there so I ordered something I was familiar with. 

Orders were: 

Monte Cristo - Turkey, ham, cheese, and bread dipped in french toast batter and fried to a crisp.  It was very interesting, it came with syrup and 2 sides of either hash browns or seasoned potatoes and eggs.  Although the concept was interesting, I thought it was ok.  It was a weird combination and it did go together, but it's something I probably wouldn't try again.  

Biscuits and Gravy - Biscuits served with gravy, the name says it all.  The biscuits were really soft and the consistency of it with the gravy did compliment each other well. Oddly though, I prefer the biscuits and gravy at South Point's Coronado Cafe.  Now that says a lot, especially since that's not voted Best of Las Vegas.  The gravy was ok, there were meats here in there, but it did taste a little watered down.  

There were a lot of other things that I did want to try, but it didn't seem as interesting.  I'd probably return here cause the service was good, and the seating was fast."}

  When my husband and I go to Las Vegas, we try to find food eating "gems" that are NOT on the strip. Last time we were there, my husband had wanted a Monte Cristo, and I read that they served one at the Luxor's Pyramid Cafe. We went and he found out it was actually a "Monte Carlo", not a "Monte Cristo".... (sadness on the part of my husband)...
 
  This time, I did some research and found that there was a small chain called The Cracked Egg. We went to the one in Henderson and.... Bruce was in HEAVEN... 
It was a REAL Monte Cristo The turkey, ham and swiss cheese dipped in a french toast batter and deep fried, (unlike the Monte Carlo, which is just grilled). I ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast, and was very satisfied. Very tasty and real fresh raspberries all over it too.
 
  Not only were the portions huge... (we couldn't finish either order), but it was all perfectly cooked to our liking. I noticed other orders around us, and they also seemed like very generous helpings. The waiter, was very fast, efficient, but still very cordial. 
I liked the fact that is is not just a breakfast house, which includes a "gluten free" menu,  but they have an extensive menu of sandwiches, burgers and salads.
  
  Needless to say, when we visit Las Vegas again, we will definitely go to the Cracked Egg for our breakfast. Maybe try the other ones a bit closer to the middle of town."}

Also, he coughed in his hands and then went to vet the toast out and put it on my plate and served me. Then as I'm eating I found an eye lash in my potatoes. The server was caucasian and had tattoos. Will never go there again thanks to him."}

I would have rated it less than one star but I didn't have that choice.  I looked this place up on the internet for breakfast.  Saw the reviews-- thought it was a good place to try. 


I have a 2lb Chihuahua, which I tuck in my jacket.  
In a nut shell, the waitress let me order, then told the other A***hole, I had my pet in my jacket and had to leave.   I would have left with no problem, but then the a***hole manger started making an issue that I had "broke the law" by bringing my pet with me.    I apologized, however, he followed me to the counter.  and again verbally attacked me.  So I begin to shout out loud.  He wanted the attention!!!.

Anyhow, if you're a pet lover, this place is a zero, the fat waitress is rude, "yeah, you know who you are!!!

This whole incident could have been handled more professionally.  Certainly not PET freindly.  Don't go there!!!

On my latest visit I had The Garden Patch Omelet which had broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese. The omelet was around $10 and came out very dry, almost inedible if it wasn't for the pounds of melted cheese on top. The veggies on the inside were mushy and indistinguishable. The side of hash browns was okay, as was the toast... but a hefty price to pay for some toast and small side of hash browns. I picked at my omelet, and left over half of it un eaten. My previous visits here were equally unmemorable, but I got to catch up with lovely Jaime W here, so I opted to give this place another shot. I think this will be my last visit to The Cracked Egg though."}

Whether sitting at the counter (no waiting) or in the main dining area (usually a wait), I have consistently experienced good service at the Cracked Egg.  At times it's a little slow, but they get very busy during weekend brunch, so it's hard to find fault with that.

You'll find typical American breakfast and lunch fare here.  Not much that would pique your interest to venture off the beaten path; but sometimes you're just looking for familiar comfort food.  Their omlettes, scrambles, and bennies are all tasty and hearty.  Their burgers are juicy and flavorful, and their salads fresh and cruchy.  Their pancakes are good too, but they're no Dupar's or Babystacks.

The space itself is large and clean, but could really use a decorator's touch.  Side benefit of The Cracked Egg is it's proximity to Popcorn Girl :)."}

It was him, myself, and my 18 month old. I was really excited to try The Cracked Egg as I love trying breakfast places, and I wanted to compare it to some other local places we have been. I wanted to love the experience so much, but I couldn't. I didn't feel that relaxed, comfortable, local feel. As in, the service was below average. I understand places such as here get busy but I worked in the restaurant industry for years so while I can be flexible and understanding I still expect good service. Our server hurried over and asked immediately wanted to order. I asked a couple of questions, we asked recommendations (she did not give us any). I wanted to do a build your own because there were a few extra things I wanted to add to my skillet. She told me just order the corned beef hash skillet off the menu instead of doing build your own (in an annoyed tone) and said it cost less (which it did not, and she said it in an insulting way as if I was trying to jip her or something). I took her recommendation anyways. I love corned beef hash, I order it almost every breakfast place I go but this was not up there compared to some other restaurant's in the areas of quality, taste, and value. I will say the coffee cake was to die for!! I absolutely loved it. The texture, temperature, and flavor was perfect. Our server wasn't seen again the whole meal except to come over and grab our plates (I wasn't done yet) and give us the check. I felt rushed in and out. I just sadly wish our dining experience out on this occasion could have been better. I was disappointed."}

Lately I'm into egg whites. I'm always sad because OPH won't scramble me some egg whites and put yummy things like mushrooms and green peppers in them! They claim veggies are for omlettes only.. So imagine my excitement when I see Cracked Egg has scrambled egg whites on the menu! With protein and veggies! They customized my egg whites to be grilled chicken + mushrooms at no extra cost. Egg whites came with delish hashbrowns + amazing soft coffee cake. Fiance got a customizable skillet. Love the options to customize that Cracked Egg has!! 

Service sucked or I would give them 5 stars. Waiter brought my eggs without the mushrooms originally (and took a LONG time to bring it back corrected). He never brought the fiance's toast out... ever.

The hash browns seemed soaked in grease and weren't very hot (reheated maybe?). The bacon was extra chewy, leading me to believe it was cooked much earlier in the day and ''stored'' until needed. 

It's drab and dark inside of the restaurant, and the employees seemed not to care much. Could have been cleaner in my opinion.

Also, know that you cannot request a flavor.

I ordered the Country Benny and it was savory and satisfying.  The sausage gravy had great texture (not too thick/not too runny) and flavor, which is difficult to find on this side of the country!  The biscuits were soft and the egg was cooked perfectly.  I wasn't impressed by the seasoned potatoes, but after eating the main entree, I didn't have much room for them, anyway.

I went one morning after 9 am with a friend for a late breakfast and we both wanted something special. That is why we choose to try their stuffed french toast. We looked at all sorts of breakfast places before deciding to come here. All thanks to the menu having something different, stuffed french toast.

My friend ordered the Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast while I had the Raspberry Stuffed French Toast. With these, you better have an appetite. Each come with six slices of stuffed french toast with a side of butter and syrup(which is overkill, the stuffed french toast prepared as is enough). The Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast comes with bananas and, of course peanut butter, although chocolate would also be nice. The Raspberry Stuffed French Toast has a raspberry cream cheese filling with some berries and powder sugar sprinkled on top. If you want anything else, you have to order is as a side but the Stuffed French Toast will have you stuffed all by itself. 

The place was busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes. Our waiter seemed to caught up in what he was doing and wasn't really engaging any of the diners.

You really can't go wrong with anything you order here.  Just make sure you get there early on the weekends.  After about 9:30 you can't see the front door when you pull into the parking lot.  :)"}

We came to meet my mom and surprise her, we asked to have one of the several empty tables near my mom's table pulled next to her table and my mom's server refused, "because it wasn't her section." Uh ok, whatever! So my husband and I just sit at a table next to my mom and wait and wait and wait for our server who never comes.
I say to my husband, I think we need to let the hostess know since we just sat here. So I did and apologized for not making her aware of us taking the table and could she get our server. 
The hostess was more than put out but I ignored it. Our server grudgingly showed up, took our order and disappeared, never to be heard from again until our food showed. I had two eggs over medium, they were fine except my food was served on a  warped plastic plate that kept spinning every time I ate off of it.
My husband ordered basic eggs Benedict. The eggs were so under cooked that the whites looked literally like snot. So nasty. He pointed it out to the server and she proceeded to tell him that's how eggs Benedict are served and continued to argue with him even after he told her that was not true.
The manager who came over was quite nice and apologetic and removed the EB from our bill with out hassle.
It took forever to get our bill from the disgruntled server and when we finally did, it appeared that the EB had not been removed. I asked the previously rude hostess who is now our cashier to look into it and she proceeds to tell me that the reason we had such a bad experience was because we had sat ourselves.
Well needless to say at this point, I'm offended beyond reason and I begin to lose it with the hostess. The manager comes again and is very nice again, but he clearly has no control over his staff.
I NOR MY HUSBAND WILL EVER FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! The food is not worth the hassle and it's very over priced. I ended up paying $18 for two eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon,  and coffee. And as someone else that wrote a review stated the entire wait staff starting with the hostess are rude, unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor. Stay away. I had been going there since the place opened and kept having bad experiences, which culminated into my last and final atrocious experience."}

I found myself here for breakfast with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect. This is your run of the mill greasy spoon, common in the country's interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite, for better or worse. They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.

The menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.

This wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.   

I may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh."}

It's your typical sit down breakfast/lunch place with omelets, pancakes, skillets, sandwiches and burgers. The portions are fairly large and the prices are decent. We always have left overs no matter what we order. 

I've tried breakfast and lunch items, but honestly nothing really stands out as "wow I need to order this again." The only thing worth mentioning is their COFFEE CAKE! It's served warm and it's so so soft. The flavor changes daily but my favorite has got to be the strawberry or the pumpkin. Even if I order a burger, I will still order me a side of coffee cake, it's that good. 

The service is hit or miss. I've had servers who looked happy to be there. However, I've also had servers who hated their lives and it showed. On our last visit, our server seemed to be rushing through the motions. No biggie though. The one thing I'm definitely not a fan of is the waiting area. It can get congested really fast. With customers having to go to the register to pay, that just adds to even more congestion.

I'm not in any rush to eat here again. But I wouldn't be opposed for someone suggested this for breakfast."}

Though it was a tad pricey for what I got, it was a re-creation of something I love at Magnolia Cafe in Austin, and it also had eggs.

I got the skillet, which is the seasoned potatoes, melted jack and cheddar cheese, and 2 eggs any style - then I get to add toppings.  The eggs - poached easy with perfectly runny yolks.  I got tomatillo sauce, scallions (not a choice but still got em), and avocado slices.  This combo just works, and it clogs the arteries too, but it is soooooo delicious.  I also tasted Eric R.'s coffee cake that came with his omelette - it was more like dessert but steaming hot, a welcome change from the cold cake slices at Starbucks.

Only confusing thing is when you walk in, there is a line for the cashier, but no hostess.  It took us awhile to find someone to seat us."}

It's fine. My girlfriend got the Lighten Up scramble and that was trash. The turkey in it was like lunch meat - Hillshire Farms style - which is also whatever, except it was such poor quality lunch meat. It was gross. We also weren't aware that the toast would come soaked in butter. She ate the potatoes and a little bit of toast and that was it, turkey ruined the scramble. It wasn't that bad overall, just very middling. Which, coupled with the other reviews, left a lot to be desired. In short, underwhelming. Might go back, might not.

I went to the Cracked Egg around noon on Sunday and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. My plan was not to eat too much because I knew I had to save room to stuff my face at the M buffet later that evening. After reading all the reviews about the big portions, I split the croissant sandwich and seasoned potatoes with my mom. It was definitely a knife and fork sandwich especially because I ordered the eggs over easy. There's a reason why you can't get an over easy egg mcmuffin. It was a delicious, cheesy mess.

I particularly loved the seasoned potatoes, which were super crispy. I can just imagine eating a whole plate of them with gravy! The bf also raved about the hash browns, but I think the seasoned potatoes were better. I also had a bite of my dad's coffee cake which was a bit too sweet for me. It looked like a cornbread square and was less dense than the coffee cakes I'm used to.

Overall, definitely a good place for breakfast or lunch. I mean, even in Vegas you can only eat so many buffets afterall..."}

However, what really takes this down for me is the service. In the time we have been coming here, only one server - Indra - really qualifies as friendly. Today, our server was downright lousy. He was very inefficient - the restaurant wasn't busy, and he seemed to have no sense of order in terms of how he took care of his tables. Honestly, if the service was just a bit better, I would probably come here more often."}

Made from a real tenderized round steak. But the $2.50 cup of coffee was burned. I know coffee. Their coffee was definitely burned, having been left heating at the beverage station they retrieved the carafe. I mentioned this to the waitress who insisted I was crazy. Apparently they are famous for their coffee. She came back with a new mug and the same carafe from the same beverage station as before. The second cup was just as burned as the first. For the price it should been fresh and rich without a stale burned bitter taste. I asked the waitress to taste the coffee if she didn't believe me. She refused. Instead, she brought my bill and loudly commented to everyone in earshot that I didn't have any taste buds. I asked the cashier to take off the price of the coffee I did not drink. She complied. When asked if I wanted to leave a tip I said, "I would have if my waitress had not chided me for not being able to tell when coffee was bad." I didn't leave a tip. There are other places for a good chicken fried steak and much better coffee. Sorry."}

There was a 15 minute wait when I went on Saturday, so today I opted for the takeout. Since everyone was ordering the chicken fried steak, I figured I'd give that a go. It was so good! Crispy and smothered in naughty, rich gravy. It also came with scrambled eggs and hashbrowns plus a delicious piece of coffee cake that I shared with a co-worker. 

Up until now I thought Farmer Boys was the big thing for breakfast. They now have some stiff competition!"}

As always the food was delicious and the server was great (thank you Vanessa).  After finishing our meal, I paid the bill and my husband and I decided not to rush off, but to relax a couple of minutes, talk, and finish off our beverages.  It was then that the restaurant manager, "Monica", came over to our table and asked if there was anything else we needed.  We said no and she replied "have a good day".  A few minutes later Monica and one of her colleagues came and stood near our table.  Every few seconds she would look my way--I guess they wanted us to leave.  When my husband got up to go to the cash register, Monica said to her colleague, "didn't they just go get change?"  And in fact I had, but needed additional change to give our sever, Vanessa, a larger tip.  While my husband waited in line at the register, Monica returned to the register area and told a waiting customer, "we are trying to get you seated together, but some people just won't leave, you know how that is".  "Monica" is unprofessional and should NOT be serving in a leadership role at your restaurant.  I guess it's time for my family to find another restaurant for Sunday brunch."}

This place gets busy! But the service here is always spot on. 

COME HUNGRY!  There is no such thing as a "light breakfast" here.  Most entrees come with a side (seasoned potatoes or hash browns) and either coffee cake or toast.  The seasoned potatoes are delicious, nice and crispy with just the right amount of seasoning!  And always get the coffee cake!  They bring out the cake first and it's just the right amount of sweet to get you salivating for your meal.  It also pairs great with coffee. 

Since I'm not huge on breakfast or heavy meals, I always get one of their vegetarian dishes.  Like I said, their portions are huge!  But with the vegetarian options, I'm able to finish up the plate with a few potatoes left over. 

Veggie Benny - sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  
The GVP scramble - comes with mushrooms, spinach, avocado & muenster cheese topped with sour cream.  

I also love the feel of the restaurant. definitely has the old school vibe.  Also look around and read the signs! There's one that says something about putting down your phones & talk to each other like its 19?? (some year before cell phones)."}

Like many Americans, I find myself skipping the most important meal of the day, however, once in a while, breakfast is valid.  Today was one of those days.  My boss and I decided to have our meeting at The Cracked Egg, for a change of scenery.

AMBIANCE: The place is alright.  The decor is a little drab and boring.  There are booths and table tops, as well as a bar top to choose from.  I think it's kind of a lame attempt at a diner/breakfast nook-ish ambiance.  Hard to pin point, because nothing really comes together for me.  I do know, however, that it's very busy.  A lot of people seem to enjoy this place.  I'm guessing it's because of the food. LOL.

FOOD and SERVICE:  Today, I got the Eggs Benedict for $9.95.  The bread was kinda of soggy.  Although this entree is smothered with hollandaise, I've had a lot of benedicts to know the potential of the bottom bread.  The poached egg was cooked perfectly, the canadian bacon was thicker than what I'm used to, which is good.  The hollandaise was thicker than what I prefer.  My entree came with hash browns which was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The way it should be!  YUM!  All in all, my breakfast was a hit.

Here's where The Cracked Egg falls short for me.  Whenever I come into this restaurant, I always end up driving separately and meeting my party there.  If I'm the first person there, I'll get a table.  Although my entire party has not arrived yet, the server DOES NOT greet our table until all members of the party arrive.  This was the third occurence that I've noticed.  I think as courtesy, they should at least greet any member of the party, no matter what percentage is present.  I will say that they have employees taking beverage orders in the beginning which I appreciate.  Two instances though, including today, I needed to order right away so I could leave early and make a meeting at work.  That's where I see the benefit of the actual server coming by to greet whoever is there.

Please don't let my rant determine your decision to visit this place.  The food is actually good.  I appreciate the fact that they have healthy options like Garden Patch omelette, the lowfat scrambble, Lighten Up scrambble and an option to have fruit as your side instead of starch options.  Their menu is filled with lots of a great choices.  Please go in and try their coffee cakes.  They are to die for!"}

There's nothing I love more in the world then a good brunch ya hear? I always order the Veggy Benny, my husband switches things up. The Veggy Benny, in my opinion, is basically made of magic. It's spot on and I have nothing but rave reviews. My husband loves their south shore scramble. He recently tried their monte crisco, basically a ham and cheese sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried, he said it was meh and should be served at a carnival so I wouldn't recommend that dish unless you're a carni, I feel like carni's don't read reviews though. The potatoes that come with your breakfast have a great spice to them. I've had the same ones at various other breakfast hubs but they're my fav so I'm happy. Now on to the famous coffee cake. First off all you yelp readers should know that I absolutely hate cake in general. I don't have a sweet tooth and I'm just not down with the fluffy cake consistency. For some reason though the coffee cake here is irresistible! They switch up the flavors every day, chocolate chip is my fav. I've never tried crack (hi mom) but this coffee cake is so crazy good that I believe it may be just as addictive as crack. Defiantly. Maybe."}

We had one close to our old place and now we are less than 5 minutes away from this one. This is not my favorite location, but the food is definitely good. 

As everyone has already pointed out, the coffee cake is fantastic. It is not exactly what you think of when people say coffee cake, it is more like a white cake with some fruit filling on the bottom and some delicious frosting on top. My only gripe is that I wish they told you what kind of coffee cake they had that day and that there was just a little more fruit filling.

We usually end up getting a skillet, but they also have delicious pancakes! I am in love with the Kicking Potatoes, seasoned potatoes, bits of bacon, and melted cheddar cheese, served with a side of salsa and sour cream. I also like the option to make your own skillet and if you are in the mood for veggies, the vegetarian skillet is a fantastic option. Most of the skillets also come with coffee cake, win!

Now, I am usually very satisfied with the food, but have received spotty service from this location. Nobody seems too happy to be working here, from the hostess, to the waitstaff, to the manager. I have even seen the manager take on a customer who had a food allergy and was very specific about his order, which they messed up. I don't think it is ever OK to argue with a customer, especially in this situation where it could have gotten really severe if the customer had a life or death allergy. There were quite a few people in the restaurant and the loud exchange was certainly avoidable, I think a sincere apology would have gone a long way. I was also present when they messed up a rather large take-out order for some of my fellow team mates at work and didn't do much to rectify the situation. 

I also really dislike the fact that you have to take your check up to the cash register. That area can get very congested in the morning since it is also the hostess station. If you manage to fight the crowd and make it to the register, I find it quite uncomfortable that they ask you how much tip you would like to leave. I don't understand why they can't just let you fill out the receipt like every other business. Overall, the food is good, but don't prepare to be WOWed by the service."}

I have been here before but never really pleased my palate. This time, I would like to say that I was very happy and full (for the entire day) with my meal. 

I got a scramble... Lucie's Scramble! Made with 3 eggs (yikes!) sausage, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms.... with 2 slices of giant muenster cheese melted on top! Not a single ingredient was lacking, and the portions are nothing short of plentiful. Yum 

I wanted to change up my order and avoid the coffee cake and seasoned potatoes (which are good, but distract me from my main meal). Went with the hash browns and toast, and I think I will followup on my decision next time. Yes... there will be a next time, regardless of the spotty service. 

As noted in previous reviews... service is a little on the off side, but not BAD. The food is totally worth it. Can't wait for my next breakfast outing."}

The restaurant is laid out in 3 very separate areas. The gaming partition is completely separate with a separate entrance (only a shared bathroom). On entering the main restaurant, to the left is a more traditional dining area. To the right is an airier, more casual dining area, with some couches and some tables, with lots more light. We've come for HH and had the chicken lettuce cups (excellent!!), baba ghanoush, hummus, and dip sampler. Not disappointed with any of them. The pizza is thin crust. Quite good. This last visit I had the shrimp angel hair pasta. It has roasted mushrooms and artichoke. I asked for light lobster cream sauce - they made it perfectly. And as usual, service was excellent."}

I shared a thin pizza with sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts and goat cheese and it was so flavorful, fresh and light , I then shared a chopped salad with chicken with a very light red wine vinaigrette.  It was so fresh and delicious.  The serving sizes are very generous and the prices extremely reasonable.  New to the Henderson area,  this was the best restaurant I've been to.

I have very high expectations seeing it's my birthday dinner. I choose to give them my money which will never happen again. It took 20 minutes for someone to take our order, I never knew my servers name, when the order was taken 2 entrees were not entered into the system.  Dressing was not brought and forgotten about. The chopped salad was the worst salad ever. No server came and asked if everything is ok. So here's my advice.... Do not give a server a busy station, servers need to communicate with customers as people because last time I check I was a person and I can be talked to about anything. The manager was absolutely amazing and I thank him for that but no service recovery helped us. Please retrain your servers. The customers deserve that for giving you their money and are there for a positive experience so they will be repeat customers. I hope this changes because it's just another checked off place that I will never go to."}

Pros: awesome menu and even better beer selection! 

Cons: kinda pricey, spot on for the "area" since it's across the highway from The District but two lunches and 4 "craft" draft beers later was like $55! 

The price won't stop us from coming back. It'll be interesting to see how this place works out after a few months. Service was great but they had a ton of people on the wait staff since they just opened.

Wonderful pear pizza. Good service even though the they were training a newbie server.

The Old Fashion drink was close to expected. The comp birthday treat was really good. The ice cream came in a wine glass dripping in caramel and chocolate sauce. Very unique since the sauce held the glass to the serving plate as well as lined the inside of the glass and was layered over the ice cream.

Yes indeed, will return.

The inside of the restaurant has a beach/Florida theme. Plenty of windows allow for a bright dining room. The atmosphere is lively and a little noisy without being too loud. This would be a good spot for families since kids likely wouldn't be heard by surrounding tables. 

The menu offers a great variety of food items. They have a large list of appetizers, pastas, tacos, burgers, salads, pizzas, entrees, and desserts. They offer light options as well as heartier meals. 

Our waitress was pleasant and attentive. She was around checking on us frequently and made sure we had drink refills. 

Chicken Lettuce Cups were a delicious starter. The mixture of chicken, hoisin sauce, and vegetables worked well together. Asian Shrimp Pasta was my choice of entrée for the evening. Everything in this dish was great and the peanut sauce was very tasty. The peanut sauce did make for a very rich dish so I'm not sure I'd order this again, but it did taste great. My husband went with the Spicy Italian Sausage and said it was a good pizza.

VERY comfortable and unique.  Had a good view of the TV, but you have to turn your head slightly.  Service was a little spotty as the bartender was busy.  This is why I usually don't sit in the bar area at restaurants when I am dining.  However, once I ordered, my food was out very quickly.

I had the sliders with fries and added gorgonzola cheese.  Fantastic.  The bun is soft and toasty and did not fall apart.  This was particularly impressive as the burger was JUICY.  The patties are flavorful.  I could use a little more of the sauce, next time I order them I'll probably ask for more on the side.  The fries are good, thin and crispy with some nice seasoning.  

Cool design and atmosphere with a comprehensive menu.  We'll definitely come back."}

My friend's step-mom recommended this place. Had dinner here on 12/20 with my friends. I was already impressed as soon as we were seated because they sat us at one of the best tables they had. The hostess sat us at the corner table that had a huge comfy couch. Our table was really nice because we had a view of the street and it was super super comfortable. Our server's name was Anthony (I think). We had wine questions and he was very helpful. After our drinks came we decided to start on their Mediterranean Dip Sampler and they were really amazing! My friends and I ordered own entrées and we were not disappointed at all with what we ordered. Then, as soon as we finished our meal and started talking about dessert our server placed a huge complimentary sundae on our table. The Messy Sundae is a must have because it's like being a little kid again. The sundae was a tall plastic wine glass that had vanilla ice cream in it with caramel and chocolate all over the whole thing topped with whipped cream. It was sooooooo good! 
My overall opinion:
I really like the ambiance of this place. Their furnitures are comfortable. I have no complaints at all about the service our server did a very good job. Their menu looks great. The price range is pretty reasonable. They have a decent wine and beer selections. For a place that opened just a few months ago, I think they are doing a pretty good job. :)"}

After I had written my letter in June 2015, I reluctantly hoped that the level of service would rise and match the pleasant dining atmosphere and the great food that Sammy's has to offer. Indeed, we had not frequented Sammy's for over a year, thinking that instituting some necessary changes would take some time. Several months ago, we decided to return and were very pleasantly surprised that the level of customer service had improved a great deal. But, after several satisfactory visits, we found yesterday that things at your Henderson location had really not changed at all.

Yesterday evening, Saturday at 5pm, we were promptly seated at our table by a very friendly hostess, who recited the standard line that "a server will be with us right away." This section of the restaurant was empty when we arrived and we were seated very near the hostess's reception desk and in plain view for all to see. During the 15 minute wait time, we witnessed some very astonishing events.  First, the hostess, who had seated us, seated an elderly couple next to us. As she walked by, she had not noticed that we had not been greeted by any server. Second, the busboy who was preparing a table for 12-14 next to us, walked by twice to move chairs and a table needed for the larger group. He also had not noticed that no one had greeted us. Third, and most disappointing of all, the manager on duty would never have noticed us because she was very busy displaying her new manicure to the hostess. After 15 minutes of holding menus and not being offered a glass of water in an empty section of the restaurant, we concluded that no one cared whether we stayed or departed. So, we departed Sammy's, disappointed once again. Our departure triggered a reaction that was totally unexpected. The manager with the fresh manicure ran after us in the parking lot. Apparently, someone had alerted her that we had left and she confronted us, mumbling something about inviting us back in, and taking care of something..... By then, we had decided to eat elsewhere.

I need not remind you that we have very many dining choices in the area. Our favorites are Elephant Bar, Black Mountain Grill, Pin Kaow Thai, and Kabuki. Please direct your attention to Pin Kaow on Eastern Avenue, which we started visiting recently. Their customer service is outstanding. The hostess is constantly attentive to the dining customer's needs. You should take some lessons from her.

Hello Mr Ladeki:
Hello Mr Anthony Kulick,
Hello Ms Joanna Train,

It is again very unfortunate that we were sadly subjected to a disappointing dining experience as a result of the mismanagement and lack of training of your service personnel. My email with similar concerns which I had sent last year was apparently ignored by your executive team as my family and I have noticed no discernible difference in the quality of your service. This is not to say that the wait staff is in any way rude or unfriendly. They are polite and cordial, but they are at a distinct disadvantage if they are not trained properly and therefore robbed of the opportunity to sell more product, generate more revenue, and earn more gratuities.

How can it be that on a Sunday around 5:15pm, when the Green Valley restaurant is at my best estimate one third full, when there are at least 8 or 9 servers all running in different directions including past our table MULTIPLE times, when there is one very clueless onsite manager running all around, and within the entire 15 minutes after being seated and reading menus, that NO ONE, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, can take responsibility and assume the duty and obligation to greet us at the table and assure us that our server will be with us shortly? Within those 15 minutes, NO ONE even asked us if we wanted water on a day where the temperature outside was 108 degrees!! I am sure that your very inattentive wait staff was very, very busy doing other things in preparation for the evening crowd, but this lack of a simple greeting is unacceptable.

I know 15 minutes is not a long time in the scheme of world events. But some patrons know what they want when they sit down. At the very least, they know what they would like to drink. Perhaps you should convert the restaurant into a self-serve establishment and eliminate the need for staff and a clueless onsite manager.

Please do not offer your phone number to "discuss my concerns." I do not care to be offered any special treatment because I raise these issues. When I walk into a restaurant and have minimal expectations, I expect them to be met without having to write a long-winded Yelp post. Certainly I have better things to do with my time than to bring these deficiencies to your attention. 

We left Sammy's and wandered over to the Black Mountain Grill, where we were greeted by the server within 60 seconds of being seated. What a world of difference!

Perhaps you should visit Black Mountain Grill yourself and observe their operations."}

Specialty is gourmet wood oven pizzas and massive salads. Very comfortable, open air room - if you can figure out how to get to the front door! 

In depth review: very familiar with this Vegas Valley chain and decided to try it out on a Monday night. After a few minutes of navigation through the adjacent business park trying to figure out how to find Sammy's parking lot and entrance, we walked in and were surprised at how busy it was. Bar had a good crowd for MNF. After waiting a couple minutes we were seated at a large table / booth towards the front (facing Green Valley Parkway). It was a chilly Monday night and they did have one of the sliding glass walls open. I enjoyed the fresh air but my lady was cold (as usual). So bring a sweater or jacket if you go in Fall / Winter season at night. 

Service was prompt. Our waiter was still trying to master the little touch screen they use to take orders. He suggested a flatbread appetizer that comes with three different Hummus style dipping sauces. So we ordered that along with a margarita pizza and a grilled shrimp salad. Explained to him that we wanted the pizza and the salad brought out together as our entrees and that we would split them. So we wait about 25 minutes (too long) and finally our flat bread and dip came out to munch on as an appetizer. As soon as I reach for it another runner arrives with our entrees in hand. Was not too pleased and explained that we just got our appetizer and please take the entrees back. For some reason many quality places in Vegas have this issue with timing and seem to want to turn tables as fast as they can?!

Waiter comes back and apologizes. Blames it on the kitchen (obviously). Either way, we enjoy the appetizer and the entrees come out later. They were great. The salad was massive and could easily feed 2 - 3 people. The pizza was cooked perfect and blew similar style at a CPK or Settebello out of the water! 

We were too full for desert but I could see the tables around us ordering them and they looked delicious. Actually they looked massive and could easily be shared. 

Really not going to hold the issue with timing against them. They are a new spot and obviously need to work out some kinks in their operation. Our waiter was super polite and we think he will be just fine as soon as he masters that touch pad. He did comp the appetizer and our drinks. Manager never came to table to apologize but we are sure he signed off on the comp. Also did not get a good night when we walked out and past the hostess - but thats OK. 

We will be back. It's a really nice casual spot and very reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you. Great location and it should do just fine."}

The food is terrific! It's always such a treat to see a whole wheat crust pizza option. The salad portions are huge. Seriously, huge. My only wish for them is that there'd be a smaller/cheaper salad option that I could add on to my meal. 

I just love the ambience of this restaurant. It's modern but comfortable. Little to no area to hang out, though, while you wait to be seated... That awkward moment when you're standing half inside/half outside unable to close the door as you wait to be greeted by the hostess. 

The service was incredible. They accidentally made my pizza with a regular crust instead of the wheat that I'd ordered. They quickly brought me the correct pizza despite saying I'd just stick with the wrong one and took it off the bill to make up for my "troubles". That is seriously the way to retain loyal customers! Kudos, Sammy's. 

Can't wait to go back and try some of the tapas from the half off menu at happy hour!"}

The service isn't usually that great but no big deal, the lobster bisque and garlic cheese bread (my favorite) out-weighs the not so attentive service.  Last night will be the last time I eat from this place.  I ordered the lobster bisque and garlic cheese bread to go and brought it right home and ate it.  About 2 hours later I began throwing up violently on and off for a couple hours.  Waking up this morning on Thanksgiving of all days still with a very upset and sensitive stomach.  I have no other "illness type" symptoms.  I think the need to have someone from the health department come out and check the dates and temps because I definitely got sick from eating from here last night.  Not good at all."}

But it's decorated nicely and has a good ambiance. It has both the normal restaurant area, as well as a 24/7 tavern, gaming area. Service is attentive and friendly in both areas. And hey, I hit 4-of-a-kind twice here, so that's pretty awesome. Happy hour is 4-6pm and has multiple small appetizers and drinks on special. The apps are smaller portions than the regular apps, so you aren't exactly saving a bunch of money. But it is nice in that it allows you to try out multiple apps, as opposed to getting full on just one. All of the food I've had here has been great. I love their goat cheese pizza. And the mac 'n' cheese is fab. I wish they still had the kobe beef hummus, but the regular hummus is still tasty. The meatballs are pretty good too. All in all, this is a great place to play, dine, and do happy hour."}

Decor and Vibe

This was a very cool "mature" version of Sammy's which I am used to living in California. They had these great open windows that actually slide open to open up to the outside so the entire restaurant became almost a patio. Beautiful decor, with very cool fire pits for groups. 

Food

Loved how many healthy options were on the menu. My wife is super picky and gluten free. We shared a Mediterranean plate, a balsamic chicken salad and Mahi Tacos.. all around deliciousness.  

Service 

The server was very helpful and gave us great information for their $10 lunch special that we couldn't do because we were there later than the timeframe, but it sounded great.

Parting Thoughts

This is a great spot to bring a business meeting, an event, a date.. definitely sophisticated and affordable. Wish they had one of these in San Diego!"}

This spot is close to home and I like the ambiance inside of the restaurant. It has a sort of Florida feel.

The brunch here is great. The menu has a nice variety of options and all of the food is really good. I love the small plates here, especially the Lettuce Cups, Lobster Mac & Cheese, & Edamame. They also have a Raclette & Potato pizza that I enjoyed. It was a thin crust pizza with potato and cheese. It didn't have a traditional marinara pizza sauce making it a little different. Different in a good way. The Salted Caramel Pudding for dessert was one of my favorites too.

Now on to the reason why I don't come here anymore despite the fact that I love the food, ambiance, and location. The service was always a miss. The bad service was the most consistent thing that they do at this location. From slow service with disappearing servers to dirty dishes that sit on the table and aren't cleared I just got fed up. Since I liked the food I kept coming back, but ultimately the bad service started to mar the experience and I just couldn't keep coming here. I can deal with mediocre service for good food, but not awful service. The tables here are tiny and the tapas style lends itself to many plates. I found that we were always trying to clean the table ourselves since nobody would clear plates. Every.single.visit. The final straw was when we came in a group at my suggestion and I felt really embarrassed for even recommending the place.

So, the food is good, but you have to be able to tolerate slow and inattentive service to enjoy yourself here."}

The food is great, just an awful lack of service that doesn't match the the dollar signs here. We were seated to our table and waited 7mins until we were greeted and once we told our server our beverage order, she disappeared for another 4mins to grab our waters and my boyfriend's tall Blue Moon. Then, although we were beyond ready to order our food, she disappeared for another  5mins. We were really hungry and really impatient at that point. We felt bad but we just grabbed our drinks and made our way to the bar, as she was taking way too long. The table next to us even noticed our irritation, as they sat there with the same irritation because they had been sitting for a while without service too. As we got up and moved ourselves to the bar, that table next us got up and left the establishment. We obviously told the bartender why we moved and he apologized but hardly had any urgency and the manager was even right there and she didn't even care! It was a rather lengthy late night dinner and we're definitely disappointed, as we always are when we leave Sammy's. Can't come here when I'm in a hurry that's for sure. Guess I'll stick with California Pizza Kitchen for similar menu items and much better service. Doesn't ever get any better at Sammy's unfortunately."}

This one is by the the most visually appealing. The lay out is different than all the others. They have a wonderful bar area next to a full glass window wall that opens up, the fresh air is great reminds me of California style restaurants.

Appetizers : Asian style calamari ( very unique) I highly suggest this. 
Hot Rock: 600 degree rock in a bed of salt, and you get to cook your own beef on it. Very tasty and interesting. Also we had Vietnamese crab stack. That was really good and fresh with real crab, and a little lemon grass ginger flavor.

Had a glass of Pinot and the shrimp and grits . Very good, not something I would ever order, I was being spontaneous that day. The waiter suggested it and it was a GREAT suggestion.The grits are not like grits at all, not a single gritty grain actually. Made very well with a stack of steamed greens.

Our waiter was very nice. His name was Zack. Its rare you find people who actually enjoy their job. There is nothing that makes your food taste worst than a fake good mood. We certainly didn't get it with this guy. He is much appreciated, and made my birthday great.

I love the new location, and will be back regularly."}

We wanted to bring our neighbor here since he doesn't live here full time.  He's a 'smooth' talker.  He walked around the restaurant, saw the huge corner table was empty and immediately went to the hostesses to ask for that table.  It was reserved but they hadn't showed up yet and were late for their reservation.   One of the managers said if they didn't show up in 5 minutes the table was ours!   Lady luck!  They sat just the 3 of us at this huge comfy table!  Nice!

Kimberly was our fantabulous waitress!  She was bubbly, attentive and just plain awesome!  We kept trying to talk her into joining us for our meal.  Of course she was working and couldn't explain that one to her boss.  But she was a delight for our entire dining experience.  

Hot Rock appetizer anyone?  It was so good the first time and was just the same this evening.   The steak was full of flavor as we cooked it to our enjoyment.   This will probably be ordered every time we visit Sammy's.   Delicious!

We decided to go family style and split everything we ordered.  This included the Kobe beef sliders with fries and the Hawaiian Pizza.  OH MY!    Full of flavor and perfectly cooked describes both of the items to a T! The thinly sliced pineapple on the pizza instead of chunks gave the pizza an all over evenly hawaiian pizza taste!  I loved this way of preparation because sometimes you just get all pineapple on one piece when it's in chunks.   Hawaiian Pizza ~ A+ !   The 3 kobe sliders were cooked to our liking (medium rare) with cheddar evenly melted on top.  Sometime even the more simple burgers can be the best! 

Sammy's is definitely an asset to Henderson and I can't wait to go back again.  The food and service are definitely top notch!"}

Very happy with the way they pulled off these events given the size of the crowd. Pricing was fair for food/drink. Service was very good - not rushed or wanting. Each pairing event had a rep for drinks that went around to each table and a brief run down of the food plates by the chef.

Just couldn't give 4 stars since I consistently witnessed all team members "getting it done" and the reps helped give that VIP feel. 5 stars EARNED.

The other patrons seemed satisfied and conversation in the event area was free and fun.

Good job Sammy's!"}

The pizza is spectacular. They serve out of the box recipes, so if you're feeling adventurous for a new restaurant, this is the place to go. The decor is also nice and cozy. 

The only downside is how loud it is. The kitchen is not closed off so that creates a lot of background noise and the restaurant doesn't have sectioned walls for seating so noise is traveling throughout. I had to yell at my boyfriend even though he was right in front of me. Kind of ruined the moment. 

I would just order for pick up if you want it to be intimate or want to be able to have a conversation with the person you are with."}

Really like the indoor yet outdoor feeling of the "patio" dining area.
I love their patio dining atmosphere... open, airy and just all around fun... like being in someone's solarium.  The groupings of tables and "booths" which are overstuffed chairs/couches is really nice.

I'm thinking this would be a nice place for happy hour... not dark and closed in like some places... this is light and open.  

Their salads are big enough to share.
Their Mediterranean appetizer trio is awesome... love it!  
The chicken lettuce wraps are filling if you happen to get them as an entrée like I did.
Well... ok... so I was full after eating most of the appetizer and then my lettuce wraps.

Next time.... if I go with my mom again... we'll order 1 salad and 1 Med appetizer and that will do us just fine.

Note... don't order a Bellini... they don't make it with peach puree or peach juice... it just came out as sparkling wine.  This was a miss."}

My family and I ate at the Henderson location about an hour ago (currently 3:54 PM) on May 9th. My brother ordered the goat cheese pizza and bit down only to find a SCREW attached to a plastic frame baked into his pizza. A manager was called over and she proceeded to take the plate and didn't acknowledge  that there was a literal SCREW in his food. Not only could he have choked but he could have bitten down and had a screw in his gums. She took his pizza off of the bill and gave us a "birthday dessert" but she should have covered the entire $80 bill! We spent so much money to have a good time and our appetites were ruined within minutes. I want to speak to the higher ups because apparently the day managers don't know how to handle potentially dangerous situations correctly."}

The grilled chicken balsamic salad cravings finally got the best of us, and we decided to venture out and find the next closest location. We were immediately impressed by the new space. There were some more traditional seating options along with some tables surrounded by big, fluffy couches. We were seated at a corner table surrounded by a long, curving couch and we began our wait. 

We waited for long enough for our server to greet us that we started to question whether we should go somewhere else. Just as we were getting up to leave, a server, Jules, hurried over to see what was wrong. She insisted that we stay and promised that they would take care of us. 

And take care of us they did! Jules was really friendly and engaging. I got the feeling that she was providing excellent service because it was the way she operated rather than just because she was trying to smooth over a rough situation. At her suggestion, we ordered an array of happy hour tapas rather than the individual meals that we were familiar with. It turned out to be great advice. We would definitely go back during happy hour because it was so much fun to try so many different little tasty treats. 

The rest of our experience was fantastic. The manager came over multiple times to make sure that we were satisfied. It took a little while for desserts to come out as the dinner crowd arrived, but it was a totally reasonable amount of time to wait for how busy it had gotten. The messy sundae was well worth the wait though. It was just as much fun to play with as it was to eat! The manger came by one more time to see us off and make amends on the check. We'll definitely be back."}

The reason for the low star is our waitress. She was curt to the point of being rude.  My gal asked for the Orange-Horseradish sauce as an addition to her salmon, and the waitress say it's not horseradish sauce, it's Orange Marmalade. My gal asked her (very sweetly I might add) to check for her as it's delicious and she's had it before with the coconut shrimp.  The waitress brought her Orange Marmalade with no horseradish mixed in.  We went ahead and ate, then my gal asked for the menu and she, sweetly again, showed the waitress what she was talking about and the waitress said "Well, we call it Orange Marmalade" and walked off.

My favorite is their goat cheese pizza but that's what I always get so it was time to try something different. We got the brie cheese and truffle oil thin crust pizza, wagyu burgers and mini kobe beef burgers.

Brie Cheese and Truffle Oil Thin Crust Pizza:
I love brie and truffle/truffle oil. Our server warned me this was going to be very truffly and fragrant - it was not the case. The brie was strong enough to subdue the truffle oil a bit. 4/5

Kobe Beef Sliders:
The beef patty was juicy. The gorgonzola was great with the burger. Comes with fries. 3.5/5

We had a few family members with very specific requests which were all granted. So, I can't complain. The service was great. Their menu seems it has more items compared to the Sahara location."}

During Happy Hour, the mixed drinks are 50% off with majority of the drinks being around $12. The wine is $2 off and beer $1 off. Happy Hour runs from 3-6p, 7 days a week- not too shabby. Also, the appetizers are on sale!m during Happy Hour. 

My friend ordered the mini duck tacos, which she said were fantastic. The duck has great texture and the veggies sprinkled on top were nice and fresh. For her main course she tried the Wagyu Mini Sliders. These came with the lettuce/tomatoes and onions on the side with a huge side of crispy fries. The Wagyu Sliders were nice and juice +the cheddar slice on top- perfect! 

Tonight I tried the Shrimp Angel Pasta. The lobster cream sauce atop this is so creamy and delicious. It also comes with artichokes, mushrooms and zucchini slices. Not too heavy, yet filling! 

As much as I want to give 5 Stars, unfortunately there was a mix up in the kitchen and our food took longer than expected. Two other tables nearby (which walked in after us) revived there food way before us. Also, I would liked our server to check in on us more than what we experienced tonight. 

Other than that, I liked how the manager remembered me from my Yelp Elite Week experience from two weeks ago! He walked up and said, "your back!" That's cool he remembered me!"}

My friend had the Chicken Hummus wrap, I looked over and the plate was clean so I have to assume it was really good! ( I mean the plate even look licked clean!!!)

Marcus was our Bartender and was doing a good job of keeping up with the demanding crowd growing at the bar, plus the wait staff coming to get drinks as well, he was busy!!"}

First off Matty and crew did a fantastic job with their service. They were quick and attentive and Johnny on the spot with my questions. The drinks had a nice punch and mixed correctly so I could enjoy my meal and not be overly buzzed. The food well the Kobe sliders were nice, the pizza under whelming with first try cold. That was not my gripe, for the true downer to the attentive patron was the manger chewing out in slient fashion the bartenders for a issue with the togo's and taking out $10 from their tip jar. My business opinion, since I own three, is to have dedicated personal for Togo orders. The bar was super slammed with just restaurant business. The star of the show was the service at the bar and the sweet hostess whom picked up my fallen coat from my stool on more then one occasion. The empathy is there with the staff, and so I will be back tomorrow to try something new on the menu, for I recommend this place."}

Is it a great atmosphere for friends, family, drinks, and decent food? Yes.
There is nothing above and beyond about Sammy's, except maybe the great service. Every time I have ever dined here, I am pretty blown away by the attentiveness of the staff. 
I also really love the ambiance. You can sit at the bar and watch the game, dine at a normal booth or table, or in nicer temps, they have opening glass doors to a beautiful garden area. If you sit on that side, the booths are more like couches. Perfect for a larger group, or family dinner. 
There are a few menu items that stand out to me. The mini duck tacos, the lobster mac & cheese, and as small as it may seem, the freakin' cheesy garlic bread is pretty bomb. The salads are huge, and the pizza is decent. 
Plenty of selections, including unique options like lamb, and meat cooked on a hot stone right at the table. 
All of the desserts are to die for. Even the huge plate of cotton candy that is enough sugar for 10 kids! 
I will continue to dine here, but it will never be my first choice. Unless it's for cocktails. Great selection.
Props to the entire staff for being awesome."}

There were about 8 people at the bar, the bartender said hello as we walked to our table. There were 4 tables dining.  We were told Heather would be right with us. After perusing the dinner choices on the menu Heather arrived. She asked if we would like anything to drink. I had flipped my menu over and as I was deciding between the house chardonnay and the Clos du bois Heather apparently grew impatient. She said I'll get you some waters in a clipped tone. Not more than 45 seconds had transpired since she had arrived at the table. We said water would be great thank you. She arrived back with the waters and said she would come back if we hadn't decided on entrees. We then ordered the crab and artichoke dip. She did not ask if we wanted anything other than water. I felt as though she was judging us, our appearances, and our financial status.  When she came back from placing the appetizer order I ordered a wine and we placed our dinner order. The appetizer was tasty and we enjoyed it while mulling over what Heather's issue might be. While waiting for our entrees we heard a plate clatter to the floor in the direction of the kitchen. We joked that it was one of our dinners considering the amount of time that had passed. 5 or more minutes later Heather comes to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later she tells us my sliders were burnt on the outside so the kitchen was remaking them.  I work in Hospitality as a Supervisor for a large corporation and have heard every excuse for a long ticket time there is. Blaming the kitchen is a servers go-to excuse. Once the food arrived we were for the most part satisfied with it, but still slightly put off by Heather's demeanor. She was not friendly, nor did she attempt to engage in any manner. We were one of her two tables she was serving at the time. We ate quickly and when she came to clear the plates she asked if we wanted dessert. At this point I had decided against dessert not because I didn't want have dessert but because I didn't wish to be Heather's guest any longer. She brought the check, I placed my card in the book and she offered mini doughnuts to go on the house. Too little too late. I'm not saying we will not dine again because the food was enjoyable once it arrived, I am simply hopeful that should we dine again we get a server that enjoys their job and puts customer service first. We left Heather a 16% tip which was generous considering her service."}

Don't have peppers." Then had a coupon and were told, "can't use coupon and happy hour." The money is not the issue. The issue is not winning over a customer over a few bucks.

Usually this place is on point with their salads, pizza, and happy hour.  But last night was such an exception that I felt I needed to write this poor review.
First of all, they were out of skinny margarita mix.  On a Friday night??  Really??  So, I settled for a Moscow mule which showed up in the wrong glass.  Our server said it was because they didn't have any more copper mugs.  As I drank it, I found something in my ice.  It looks like the stem of something...but it was frozen in the ice....so it must have been there for a while.  The server apologized and said she would have another drink made for me.  This one showed up in the right glass!  So they were or they weren't out of them??  She explained to me that the "thing" in my ice was a part of the mint.  It was definetely NOT part of the mint.  But whatever...I'll move on from the drinks.
The Kobe sliders were ordered medium and showed up well.  The flatbread was greasy.  The Chinese chicken salad was spicier than normal, and the New York pizza was awful.  
The service was ridiculous.  We could see that she was busy and I noticed managers running food, but we were there for 2 hours and the service never got any better.  We had no silverware at one point, no water for 20 minutes.  I usually give servers a break because I used to be one....but it was bad.  Not bad enough for me to call the server out online, though.
In conclusion, I won't be returning to Sammy's for a good long while.  It's too bad, too, because it used to be great.  Hope they work out their "kinks" soon."}

I placed the order 5 days in advance AND reconfirmed my order the following day, to ensure event day would go off without a hitch. On the day of the luncheon, Sammy's arrived 15 minutes late and delivered a completely wrong order for only TEN (10) people. I was so humiliated. All 30 executives had to CHANGE the board meeting agenda so they could eat an hour later, when the rest of my order was delivered. I then asked for a receipt for this second delivery, but Sammy's said there was no receipt since they were going to take these 3 trays of food off the bill anyway, but lo and behold, they charged my card for 2 additional trays, without me signing for the receipt. What a bunch of sneaky liars! Honestly, no monetary amount could have made up for the humiliation I endured while the CEO and the rest of the C-Level executives were waiting around for food. I seriously wanted to hide under my desk. It was my time to shine as event coordinator, but Sammy's completely ruined it. Needless to say, I was and still am traumatized by the incident and never again will I put my job in jeopardy by ordering from this restaurant for any upcoming company events we have. After all, there is a sea of restaurants around Green Valley that offer good food, outstanding customer service AND would value my business."}

I asked the host if my boyfriend and I could park our bikes near the window so we could keep an eye on them. If course I forgot my bike lock. Thankfully they did not have a problem with it. 

The bartenders are very polite and never rushing which was nice since I'm very indecisive. I sat and hung out for a while and tried a few items. Lobster mac n cheese really weak. I make better mac n cheese at home.  The fries are really good but make sure you order a side of ketchup or two if you like to dip it. The Kung Paw Calamari is more like steak calamari. It is really good so definitely try it. I was not impressed with the Crab & Shrimp dip. The bartender let me try the watermelon cooler which was not good. Nothing exciting about that which I was bummed cause it sounded refreshing.  It is convenient to grab a bite or a drink late night or a happy hour but not if I want a good meal. 

Service: AMAZING
Food: Overpriced and not that great"}

A unique twist on an old classic, Sammy's is much more than the pizza joint it used to be. The ambience is very unique and the atmosphere is one that none can compare to. There are two sides of the restaurant. One side being the traditional restaurant scenery with booths and tables and the other sides have just the opposite. There are giant windows surrounding the outside of the restaurant giving it an open feeling. The booths and tables have different chairs and set ups than the usual setting. There are plants all around that give this place a one of a kind decor. The food is also nothing short of fantastic. I've been here several times. To my surprise, I find that I enjoy this place more and more every time I stop by. If you're ever looking for something new and different, I would most definitely recommend Sammy's."}

I've been back many times over the past few years and still enjoy it.  The location being right off of Green Valley and Pebble is easy to find.  The dining ambiance here is always great.  It's clean and has a welcoming feeling.  Service here can be hit and miss. For the most part they have been pretty friendly and attentive.  

I finally ordered one of their huge salads.  It was an absolute delight! The Balsamic Grilled Chicken is one that I'd order again. It's filled with mixed greens, Gorgonzola, walnuts, basil and tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  Definitely filling!  The appetizers have been a let down. Im probably going to start skipping those to go right into the main meal.  Burgers, wraps and salmon have all been good.  

I'm happy that for the most part things have stayed on par since opening."}

But there is absolutely no place like Sammy's. If you've seen Cheers, the gaming bar is precisely that type of atmosphere. Everyone knows your name, your story, and you know theirs. If you're looking for a place to be a regular, this is the place. 

Jamie and Chris are THE people that put all of us regulars together and created a strong sense of community. Jamie works Friday through Monday nights, Chris works Tuesday through Thursday nights. COME. THESE. NIGHTS. I, Jamie and Chris, and all the other regulars will welcome you with open arms. I'm writing this as I am currently bonding with the rest of the crew and Jamie. He is immensely professional, all the while making you feel at home. Having an amazing relationship with guests is key and both of them blend that immaculately with professionalism.

We were raving about the great promotions Sammy's has had in the past, and management informed us that Jamie was actually the one who came up with many of the ones we were raving about! I work in Corporate Marketing for Caesars Entertainment and part of my job is to create promotions to keep our guests coming and generate revenue. My executives and I (who I introduced to Sammy's and love it as well!) agree that we would LOVE to have Jamie on our team, THAT'S how good he is. Chris is just as exceptional, and all of us regulars agree that we would follow both of them anywhere. My parents introduced me to Sammy's 4 years ago around their grand opening (they are as much of regulars as it gets and visit Jamie and Chris at least 3 times a week) and this is where I happily spent my 21st birthday week two years ago with both of them. They're like my big brothers!

Thank you for all the amazing memories you give us each and every visit, J & C. YOU are the true epitome of service at its finest. Cheers to the many years to come!

We worried because this is  usually a very busy time, and they were very busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes outside, which was not bad at all. However, there is no place to wait inside, especially on a busy night and they need to hand out buzzers so the hostess doesn't have to come out and yell names aloud. Luckily it wasn't cold outside, so waiting was not bad at all. I'm sure they will eventually get the buzzers. 

Our server was very personable and gave good service. Our tapas appetizer of three different hummus dips with some sort of warm yummy pita bread was so good. It was perfect if you're just ordering a salad as your entrée, because that's what I did and I was totally stuffed. 

My daughters loved their dinners too: BBQ chicken with potatoes and cheeseburgers sliders with fries. I did wish they had something green on the side with the kids meals like broccoli or spinach, but the quality of the food was very good.  I would say the quality of these kids meals compared to other restaurants is better for sure. 

I had my favorite balsamic salad with chicken. I've always loved this salad, but Sammy's needs to not drench it so much in the balsamic dressing. It was very good, but overly coated in dressing.  

Husband had fish tacos which he said were very good. 

For desert, we had the most delicious mini donuts with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce. They were so good, they reminded me of churros. It was just perfect amount of sweet for four people. We loved it!

The ambiance was nice because it's fancy, but not so fancy that we didn't feel weird bringing our kids on a Friday night. We saw several other families with kids in our section, so that was good. You can tell they try to sit families near each other and the on a date and just adults in a separate section. Which is good for everyone because then the people with kids don't feel bad if they get too noisy with the people that are there without kids. 

Of course, bringing kids we had to make 3 trips to the restrooms, which were small, but also very nice. Clean and pretty stone all the way up to the ceiling. 

We will definitely be going back!"}

 The fig & arugula salad is outstanding! It's a perfect balance of spicy (arugula), sweet (fig), salty (feta), and tangy (vinaigrette). That was certainly a highlight of yesterday's visit.

The margherita pizza was interesting. Sammy's interpretation is sliced roma tomatoes and julienned basil on top of melted mozzarella. I usually don't do too many raw tomatoes, but I nonetheless dug it. I'd order it again.

Without a doubt, Sammy's is still one of the top dining spots in Green Valley. If you have any doubts, try any of Sammy's pizzas and you'll understand."}

Was there tonight for a special occasion. because we have always had a wonderful time and great food.  Tonight - and as I can see from reviews on Yelp for the past five months that validates tonight's experience - service was an absolute disaster.  Appetizers took way too long to come out. When one if the managers came by to see how we were doing, I made a comment about the kitchen being backed up. He said she would find out what the delay was. Literally sixty seconds later, they came out... along with one entree. Sent that back and were told they would remake it and serve with the other entrees. Entrees came out - 4 of the 6 ordered. Ten minutes later the missing two finally came out after my husband complained to the manager.  Had to send one of the entrees back. These mishaps continued throughout the evening. Though the manager 'adjusted' our bill to compensate for all the mishaps, our semi-absentee waiter and all the other mistakes ruined the evening. And from recent reviews, these types of issues have been ongoing for months. No wonder, on a Saturday night, the place was half empty.  Please Sammy's - FIX THE PROBLEMS. We'll not be back until we see better reviews."}

We arrive at 11:15 for our reservation and we're seated quickly. It was clear that they had understaffed. Both managers were running food and there were about 3-4 servers on the floor. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and after 40 mins our food arrived, cold. Imagine a cold Eggs Benedict and a asparagus scramble, not good. I will never send food back usually, but after that kind of wait, the food had better be good. We returned both our dishes to be remade, after another 20 mins our food arrived and mine was a completely different meal! It was so bad it was laughable. I sent that back and just enjoyed the side of pancakes we ordered. Sure, Sammy's removed the meal from the menu, as expected and none of this was the fault of the server, she was slammed with tables, but it's nothing short of poor management. How do you not staff up for Mother's Day!?! On top of this, the food was bland. Something needs to be reassessed here because with each visit it's getting worse."}

We were very excited when we heard Sammy's was coming to the vacated former-Applebee's location 5 minutes from our home.  We went to Happy Hour on Friday.

It was crowded but we still got 2 seats at the bar.  First, the good news:  The Kobe burgers were exceptional, nice touch with the optional Gorgonzola cheese.  We liked the shrimp & artichoke dip, much better than the spinich-artichoke dip we had at the nearby Elephant Bar the night before.  The Thai chicken satays were good with an exceptional peanut sauce.

The house Chardonnay was Grey Cellars, I believe, at the discounted price of $5.50 a glass.  Not bad.  Some of the normal appetizers were half-price.  Again, not bad.

But, as a former bar manager at a high-volume restaurant-bar in Dallas and former restaurant owner, I was shocked by the very poor service at the bar.  This comes from an owner's perspective in that it was so slow and unattentive that a lot of money was left on the table, for the restaurant and the corresponding 20% tip.  

The design and layout of the establishment is outstanding.  The south walls were totally open and the seating was very unique in certain areas giving you the feeling of being at somebody's home.  Fantastic!

The design of the bar did not anticipate any high volume.  The lower inner portion of the bar prevents close interaction from the barkeep with the customers.  They have to lean way over in spots to serve customers at the bar.  The width of the bar is not conducive for good assistance from bar-backs.  It is very crowded back there.  The bartenders are responsible for the high number of to-go orders phoned in.  The bartenders should be selling drinks and food while appeasing the clients at the bar, not serving up bags of already-ordered carryout meals.  

Subsequently, we would have ordered at least one, probably two more rounds of drinks in the time we were there.  We could not get the attention of the bartender to give us our final tab for over 10 minutes.  Even after requesting the final bill, it took another 10 minutes to get our charge card ran.  Again, putting the "owner cap" on, the customer turnover at the bar would be much faster with better service at the bar.  Thus, the restaurant and the bartenders are losing money.

I know Sammy's owner is damn good.  Overall, his restaurants show that.  BUT, I wish he would have given me a phone call asking my advice on the setup of the bar.  

We will come back, but never on a busy night."}

Good food, good servers and TERRIBLE hostess.  Little girls with NO clue what to do :(   Might go back if management gets rid of the CLUELESS half-wit girls."}

We were on our way back from Lake Mead so we stopped by here for a quick bite. We were seated near the door next to the lovely green outdoor garden. With the cool breezes flowing around us, we enjoyed looking at the fake but beautiful orchid and green plants, as well as munching on the fish tacos, lobster bisque, chicken lettuce cup and even a few beers! Even though I thought they were rather salty, I liked them and I would totally come back to try more items!"}

It took us an hour and a half to have a meal here on a Sunday night. We sat there for 30 mins before we had our drinks. Like previous posts, we noticed the manager standing near the bar watching football while his Restraunt was falling down around him. We saw several employees on the floor but "they" were clearly running the show, and poorly at that.

Steps of service were nonexistent. From start to finish the service was lacking on every level. Our server's section was clearly larger than she could handle, follow up was a joke, dirty dishes in front if us the whole meal, we wanted refills on our drinks but couldn't get them and the check took forever to come and God knows we couldn't wait to leave this place! 

Save yourself from a huge hassle and order Domino's..."}

Rachel and Alesia treated us just right tonight. They are so friendly and even remember what we usually order every time we come in. And we try to make it a Friday night routine. 
AND our son was visiting LV and wanted to come to Sammy's because we have talked so much about it. Garrett was not working but he arranged it so that we could surprise our son and his girlfriend by paying for their meal by calling in our credit card. And he wasn't even working that night!  This place is our "Cheers"!"}

The last tine we came to Sami's the same female was rude- same thing is happening... WHY DO WORK IN SERVICE IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN SERVICE?

Now it's the end of the meal- she became nice in a forced manner. 
Keaton was amazingly friendly. YHE FOOD IS ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY YUMMY!!!
The service is always touch and go, bummer. Samies, is it possible for service and food to match in quality?"}
