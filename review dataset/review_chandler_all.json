We almost started crying as we dream about Tott's and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food.

I sure hope they open back up (maybe in Goodyear???). :)"}

Everything here is so delicious and fresh. No MSG and the best part, gluten free options! They offer multiple rice noodle dishes and if your a fan of spicy food as well, this is your place. My husband even loves it. This spot has become almost a weekly Sunday tradition. We've had the: Spring rolls, pork rolls, egg drop soup, Tom Yum soup, hot Korean stir fry, mushroom stir fry, the red curry,  green curry, yellow curry, bourbon chicken, crab puffs, chicken wings, and dragon noodles. Since we've tried just about everything on the menu, I can say our favorite dishes are the green curry, hot Korean, dragon noodles and both the spring and pork rolls! GO HERE!"}

Our go to order is Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken (it's seriously award winning!!). If you choose to go in and dine, the people that work there are so friendly. It's just a great family operated business. The pricing is amazing too, very fair and far less expensive than other "faster food" restaurants."}

Stopped in when we were nearby, hungry, and saw Tott's has a great rating on Yelp!.  Nice restaurant with a good pace of customers and very pleasant staff.  Dessert options were a step above the norm at a small diner like this, which is useful when you have little ones like my wife and I.

Food is good, but not great to my tastes.  The Hot Korean is semi-spicy and would do better with bamboo versus the carrots and more chili pepper.  My wife had the Pepper Chicken (name?) and thought it was tasty enough, but some pieces were warm while others were cool.  Dumplings are not meaty and are more veggie... and the sauce is a sweet vinegar thing that doesn't give much appreciable flavor.  Our daughters thought the Terriyaki Chicken was too dry to finish.

Pumpkin Roll was yummy.  Almond Cookie Cheesecake was left half-eaten as my wife said it tasted more like orange mixed with cheesecake.  I took a bite and have to agree."}

We tried the crab puffs which we all agreed were the best we'd had, the wonton and egg drop soup came out so hot and had more than a few peas in it like most other places, the walnut shrimp was beautiful and creamy, the Mongolian beef was a favorite and the mushroom stir fry was chock full of veggies. We also did the teriyaki chicken, sauce was a little sweet but ok because it came on the side anyways. I had the lemon chicken which was a bit flavorless for me and came with broccoli, chow mein noodles, brown, white or fried rice ( your choice). The portions were huge and we took a ton home.

Ordered a Thai Red Curry. Didn't even smell good. So you can imagine the taste. No lemongrass or nothing Thai about it. It tasted like a regular Curry with Curry powder. 
Dragon Noodle, tasted like wax.
Called the restaurant & told them about it immediately. They didn't seem to bother about it. Just said they will let the Chef know. 
We had to get Burgers & that was our dinner.
Before you start cooking food from another region you should first learn the taste. Taste it from other restaurants & then match it.

Their food was good.  Started with pork lettuce wraps which were fair.  Continued into Dragon Noodles, which were quite spicy, but the flavors were not melded well, and the wide rice noodles absorbed the moisture quickly.

The orange chicken was good.  The Kung Pao Beef was very good.  The Walnut Shrimp was probably a little too sweet for my taste.  Steamed rice was fresh, fluffy, sticky but not too sticky.

Overall a fair restaurant, and if you're in the mood for fast casual Chinese in that area, I would definitely choose there rather than the other fast Chinese restaurants that are right around there, and choose Tott's over Pei Wei."}

I phoned in an order for the orange chicken, extra spicy and the tofu curry, unfried.

The guy on the phone said their tofu is only fried.  OK, so this pretty much means they buy the tofu already fried and don't cut it up and fry it themselves... 

When I got home (3 miles away) the food was luke-warm.  The orange chicken appeared to have been prepared by dumping 1/4 cup of red pepper flakes into the sauce.  There's no veggies with the orange chicken, and it didn't taste any better than any other random Chinese place.  The steamed rice was dry and slightly hardened, another disappointment.  

My girlfriend had the tofu curry which was ok she said, nothing special.  

Inside the store it was all young people who seemed polite.  

Really, it was nothing to warrant even 2 stars in my opinion.

So far, we've tried . . . 

1) Orange Chicken 
2) Dan Dan Noodles with Beef
3) Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry 

The Orange Chicken is great. Much better than Panda Express, but that's no surprise. However, for those saying this is Chandler's best Orange Chicken? Sorry kids, but that title is reserved for Tokyo House's Orange Chicken on Alma School and Warner. It will blow.your.mind! 

The Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry could have been a little spicier. 

The Dan Dan Noodles are perfect! Tender beef, and just the right amount of spice in the garlic bean sauce. Always ask for some extra cucumber.

While I did get a student discount, my meal came out to be around $14 for cheese puffs, walnut shrimp, and brown rice.  I suppose it's a pretty standard price but here's what it breaks down to:

- Standard cheese puffs with very little cream cheese.  The scallions were a nice touch though.
- An incredibly small portion of waaay overly-battered shrimp with plain mayonnaise based sauce.

They have an open kitchen area which can be fun if you like to watch the food being prepared, however I found it odd that while I saw food being prepared I didn't smell anything. I am used to walking by a restaurant and being tempted to enter because of the delicious smell of the food they being prepared there. I went to the counter and ordered the orange chicken they seem to be famous for. The total was $6.82 which seemed reasonable. I sat down and was quickly served in a matter of a few short minutes.  My dish was served on an oval shaped platter. The orange chicken was on one side and the other side was a large helping of white rice. The dish had large pieces of chicken sitting in a large pool of orange sauce. The orange sauce had many pieces of red pepper flakes and other spices I couldn't identify. There were five or six large red and black peppers to add some spice to the dish. The chicken was not over breaded like you might expect from places like Panda Express, but the sauce was overly sweet. The sauce seemed to have a thicker consistency to it like a syrup. The five or six large peppers were a welcomed relief from the sweetness of the dish but they ran out fast. The spices and pepper flakes in the sauce didn't translate into flavor on my tongue. Im usually a big fan of orange chicken but was very disappointed in it overall and would not order it again. The owner was there and seemed very friendly, thanking every customer as they left. I saw some other food being prepared as I left and I can tell they were making an honest effort to make good food here. I saw that they were roasting their own peanuts, for example, instead if just opening a package of ingredients and tossing it in the mix. Unfortunately, my experience today didn't equate to the dining experience I had hoped for. It was just way too sweet and lacking flavor."}

They had an assortment of noodle dishes you can order from all over:  Japanese, Singapore, Korean, Hong Kong, Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Bangkok, and Malaysian styles to name a few.  Lots of reasonably priced appetizers and curry dishes.

We ordered during dinner with appetizers so it was over $10 a person, but their lunch specials are generally around $6-8/person.  We had Pork Roll (YUMMY!! I recommend this!!), Tom Yum Soup (tasty, but we won't order it again), Lemon Chicken (Yummy for the many tender cubed pieces of white meat chicken.), and the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodle (HUGE bowl of dry curry noodle.  It was good :) ).

One more thing, if you're looking to try this place out, it's next door to Starbucks."}

The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!
This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry "panang" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.
I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.
Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license."}

I phoned in an order for stir fry Mongolian beef with brown rice.  The order was ready upon my arrival so there was no wait time. The guys at the counter were friendly so no complaints about customer service. 

However, I was somewhat disappointed in my Mongolian Beef as it was extremely sweet. It was full of tender slices of beef and lots of veggies but entirely too sweet for my taste buds.

We ordered 3 plates of orange chicken with steamed rice and fried rice and also 2 pork egg rolls. The total came out to around $31.00. It was the most DISAPPOINTING Chinese food we have EVER tried in our entire lives. It literally made all of us sick to our stomachs after forcing ourselves to eat at least half of it since we paid for it. It was very very dry and the meat was extremely chewy. I had to chew it 100 times in my mouth because I felt like I would choke if I hadn't. The taste was stale and the fried rice was rubbery and lacked flavor. I do not recommend this place to anyone.

She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.

I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.

First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.

There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here."}

The owner was extremely accommodating and allowed us to sit on the patio and eat on real plates versus to-go's and told us he'd be there cleaning and finalizing some things and to take our time.  I am in sales and have a keen sense of customer service and was thrilled to learn that Tott's Asian Diner not only delivers fresh, great tasting food, but exceptional service too.  Keep up the great work!  We will definitely be back!"}

And what is it supposed to be?  Asian fast food, dine-in / take-out.

And why is it perfect at being that?  For starters:

- excellent recipes, delicious menu, lots of variety
- top-notch ingredients (no fatty meats & bright, crisp veggies)
- very generous portions (the dinner portions = 1.5 to 2 meals)
- clean (including the restrooms)
- friendly staff (managed by Yan (Yun?), the owner's brother-in-law)
- the Bourbon Chicken, Twins Pork, and Dan Dan Noodles (yes, they deserver their very own bullet point)

The first time my fiancee and I ate at Tott's, it lasted for 3 days.  We went on a Sunday and ordered the Bourbon Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles with Beef.  They were so delicious, but the portions were so huge we got to eat the left-overs for lunch the next day.

Of course, when dinner rolled around, we were dying to try more of the Tott's menu...so we did.  The next day?  Repeat.  Pretty much nothing but Tott's right on thru Tuesday.

Yan, the manager, is a very friendly person, who obviously cares about the restaurant.  He takes the product and the service very seriously.  I'm sure he's a big reason why this restaurant is so spot-on.

I can't believe this place has been around for four years (as of this writing), and I've only just now discovered it.  If you haven't discovered it yet, do yourself a favor and order yourself some Bourbon Chicken asap.

Check out the web site (http://tottsasiandiner.com/section.html) to see the menu and pricing.

Did I mention the Bourbon Chicken?"}

I remember going to Tott's back when it first opened on McClintock and Guadalupe years ago. I ate there on their second day of being opened and I have loved the place ever since. They had to move locations due in part to a Pei Wei opening up literally 100 yards away in the same shopping center. Besides location, nothing has changed with this wonderful place. 

The food is really great. I would say Tott's food is like Pei Wei's except it tastes better, they have larger serving sizes, and there is a lot more choices on the menu ;) The service at this place is excellent. If you appreciate a business where they make an effort to get to know you and remember your name you will love Tott's. 

Pros:
- Awesome service
- short wait times
- great food
- great selection
- large servings
- very competitive prices

Cons
- not much seating"}

I was super sad when they moved- because the owners of this place are genuinely nice and want to make you happy. It's Pei-Wei style restaurant, where you get your own silverware and such, and the owner and even staff would walk around and take your plate if you were done and even refill my drink. Very friendly.

I get the orange chicken like so many other people- and it's delicious. My favorite part was me and my friend COULD share a meal because it's so much food. But we'd get our own, and then take home half for later.

The pad sew ew noodles were al dente, which I like, but some may not like their noodles that tough. The pad sew ew had carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, celery, green onions, and white onions in it."}

We thought that PeiWei would do the trick, some kind of noodle something or other. Turning into the parking lot too early though had us passing this place, we yelped it and seeing its solid four stars after 40 reviews, we had to try. 

Tott's does not disappoint.  The menu is actually pretty similar to Pei Wei with one outstanding factor, the owner of this place came out and talked to us, him and his family own and run it.  They've been there for six years now he says (2 before Pei Wei).  Pretty messed up that the property owner would put a second Asian diner in there.  Pretty messed up that Pei Wei would try to exploit a mom and pop shop's built up following.

Tott's still thrives he says, and thrive they should.  Service, ingredients and preparation are outstanding here.  The menu spans several nationalities, from Chinese to Thai to Japanese.  Pretty basic stuff but great if you have a craving for any of those, and easy to suit many palates in one place.

Lady had the Hong Kong noodles.  Wide noodles with cabbage and bok choy.  Wonderful flavor here, kind of a grill taste.  My choice was Udon noodles with beef as well.  Noodles were very soft and the fermented beans that made the sauce for mine were very flavorful.  Neither dish was particularly spicy, but both had great flavor.  Definitely better than any fast Chinese I have had in the valley.

Great atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food for very cheap."}

The second time, I ordered to go.  Orange shrimp.  I couldn't decide between it and the Singapore Rice Noodle plate, but ended up going with Orange Shrimp.  The sauce was pretty sweet, but the shrimp was crispy and not too spicy.  The chow mein was decent too, but not many veggies.  The Spring Rolls were pretty good - nice and crispy.

Usually they're  so terrible with food that it'll knock you on your back faster than a kick to the face.

Tott's proved me wrong. So wrong that I came back the day after I ate there. Everything i've had has been really good, but I have an addiction to their orange shrimp. The perfect level of spice, the crunchy golden shrimp, and that godly sauce...sorry. I need to clean up my keyboard now. The walnut shrimp was really good, the bourbon chicken was nice, the stir fry is good, and the lo mein was excellent.

Wait. All this praise and it's only getting 4 out of 5? Okay, their fried rice isn't all that great (tastes pretty flat) and the won ton soup has some pretty weak won tons. 

The portions are huge though and it compensates for the flat rice. If their fried rice was as good as any other chinese place, i'll happily edit this and give them five stars. The owner is really nice though and is always thankful for your business...so my final score is a 4 1/2 out of 5."}

It had mushrooms, green beans, green and red bell peppers and tofu in a curry sauce.  The sauce was not too heavy, but enough to coat the rice a bit.  

The best part, however was that I called it in to go.  I asked for my curry to be very spicy and the GM (referenced in my earlier review) made me promise that I had enough water at home.  Cute and hilarious.

The menu has a good mix of various Asian fare, i.e. Chinese, Thai, Korean, etc.  There are a good number of spicy choices so I was happy.  We ordered wanton soup, Tom Yom soup, spicy stir fry with chicken and Singapore Noodles with chicken.  The wanton soup was loaded with veggies and shrimp (4) but tasted "fishy" to our son.  He only ate the wantons and a bit of the broth.  The Tom Yom soup was huge with tomatoes, tofu and shrimp.  It was very red in color which I'd never seen before.  The broth was somewhat thick, but very tasty with a good hot and sour zing.

The Singapore Noodles came very quickly as did the spicy stir fry.  Both were very generous portions, enough that we took some of each home. The noodles had just the right amount of curry flavor and the chicken was tender and tasty.  I'd ordered my stir fry extra spicy and I wasn't disappointed!

Overall we were very satisfied.  The price was very reasonable, food was good, staff attentive, and restaurant was clean.

My only criticisms are that the main courses came immediately after the soup so we had it all on the table at once and there was too much tofu in the Tom Yom soup."}

I opted for the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodles with Chicken. 

Portion Size? Plentiful.

Price? Inexpensive, slightly more than chains (e.g. Panda Express).

Taste? The chicken was overwhelmingly dry and the vegetables were bland. The seasonings and noodles were average.

Of course, there may be dishes on the menu that they do a better job with but that would involve making a lucky pick. With so many Asian options in Chandler that specialize in a particular cuisine (strictly Thai or strictly Chinese) it makes it hard to justify a return visit."}

I usually go to Pei Wei whenever I'm feeling in the mood for some quasi-Chinese food, but I'm pretty sure this spot is going to take its place. My first time here, I ordered take out and low and behold, I was actually shocked at the portion size of my dish. I had fried rice filled to the brim of a Chinese to-go box and the Kung Pao shrimp was in an entirely separate container. They didn't skimp on the shrimp or the veggies. It tasted extremely fresh and was super flavorful. 

My second time around, I got the lunch size portion (which still lasted me two meals) of Mongolian shrimp. It was out of this world. Absolutely incredible. I definitely recommend this. 

What takes the cake for me, however, are the cheese puffs. They are absolutely INCREDIBLE and I would go back just for these alone.

As a test, go to Panda Express and this place, order the orange chicken and have someone taste them both. You will see that there isn't a difference in the taste. 
I expected more from this place but the food is just your basic frozen food cooked in a wok...or microwave. I will say that my wife the lemon chicken and it tasted like it was cooked, left out, and then reheated, you know it had that "reheated" taste. 
Unless the reheated taste is just the taste of the food and in that case it's just bad.

The service I guess was nice. 4 people on staff at the time, all were standing around talking. One guy was standing in front of the register playing jewel craft and he didn't acknowledge I was there. A girl took my order after shooing the guy away so she could enter my order in the register.

We also got pot stickers and they tasted like chemicals found in cleaning solution. My only guess for this was that they were sprayed on accident when someone was cleaning but it ruined them. They were also still raw and very under cooked. One was still cold in the middle.

If you want really good Chinese food, I suggest going to China Palace instead.
They are always nice and helpful. I like their orange, sesame, and lemon chicken and it has a nice crispy taste to it, not soggy like Tott's.

Overall, if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you."}

The menu at Totts seems to have a significant vegetarian menu, but eater beware that here, fish sauce, shrimp paste, eggs, and CHICKEN powder, is considered vegetarian.  You are best off asking for a "vegan" option.  ( I think there is only one).  

I think I eventually got  the Spicy Szechuan with tofu/veggies. The portion was huge, the veggies were fresh.  It tasted ok. The restaurant is clean. The server / host staff was very nice.  The owner, I am truly disappointed in. 

I got there, ordered what I presumed was vegetarian (asked if sauce had shrimp/fish paste -they said no).  Afterwards, I asked if the curries had fish/shrimp paste, and she said yes, and asked if I had an issue with animal byproducts, because the dish I had ordered, has CHICKEN powder in it.  Apparently they consider Chicken powder to be vegetarian.  Fine, whatever, we have different definitions. I appreciated that the woman went back to grab my ticket / ask if I could get the dish without it / what I could get instead. 

Next the owner came over to me, and got really upset!  All I asked him, was to clarify what on their menu, did not have any animal byproducts.  His response was that your people come in here all the time and have different definitions of vegetarian.  This is my restaurant, and yes, here this is what I call vegetarian.  Fine, I'll agree to disagree on the definition of vegetarian, but by no means, as the owner should he have YELLED at me for inquiring what he considered to be vegetarian / what they had that did not have animal products in it.  

If we had not already paid, I would have left.  

So while, the place is clean, staff was nice, food was ok, the owner/GM was outright rude, and had extremely POOR customer service.  For that I go out of my way to write a review, give you a 1, and tell ALL OF MY VEGETARIAN friends to avoid your restaurant.  

Thanks for the unpleasant experience."}

Also comes with a separate container full of noodles for take away.  Finally,  my son loves the Yellow Panang Curry.  Great veggie selection and plenty of whatever protein you choose to put in it.  He gets angry when I eat his leftovers on this dish.  Don't feel sorry for him as he has eaten more than his fair share of my leftovers while I toil away at work!

Do yourself a favor and go to Tott's for the best asian food in the valley that falls into the category somewhere between Americanized Asian food and "real" Asian cuisine.  Now, I am going to get in my car and travel through this horrible rain so I can get me some!"}

I saw the menu on the window and liked what I read. I went inside this place it is small but very clean. The tables were wiped down and shiny, there was dishes and condiments on each table.  I had the Salt and Pepper Crispy Chicken and asked if I can substitute the rice for steamed veggies. The gentleman said yes. My total was $8.00 and I took my order to go and waited for a few minutes until a gentleman walked over to hand me my bagged order which had soy sauce, napkin, fork, menu, and a fortune cookie. 

The taste was really good and spicy. I will return to try more of their dishes. I think it's say better than Panda Express flavor wise and less expensive than Pei Wei."}

1) the pad thai (sp?)
2) bourbon chicken

and i don't recommend the walnut shrimp (unless you like eating a whole jar of  mayonaise dumped onto shrimp)  perhaps it would be wise to ask them to leave the mayo on the side and you can add as much or as little as your gut can handle.

the service is friendly and the place is as clean as the starbucks next door.

what's cool is that they offer brown rice and i don't recall them charging extra for requesting it (take note other nickel-and-dime you to death restaurants)!

although i have to make a note of a time when we were there a half hour before closing.  the kitchen crew was soaping up the exhaust hoods and everything else while customers were still coming in to eat.

luckily (?) we already had our food at our table but who knows, mebbe we were eating tilex chicken too!

i guess that's the cons of having an open kitchen...the customers get to see the good, the bad and the ugly."}

I have not been eating here when I have easy access to it. I remember when I finally went in there this past Saturday, that I had stopped by this place when I first moved to Arizona and really wanted a smoothie-but I think all their smoothies had dairy so I just left. A really nice warm environment-still totally a quick lunch place, but I still felt comfortable coming here at night-and judging from the full tables of ASU hipsters feeding each other tofu on dates, so did they.

I mean, the staff knows what is in all their dishes and I asked for the Tofu Yellow Curry with no fish sauce added in with rice which came within ten minutes and it was so good. Not very complex, but there were plenty of vegetables in it for once (not the usual onion and sad little pepper swimming in curry) perfectly sauteed and the rice was so good I kept eating it by itself instead of pouring the coconut in it.

I also really liked grabbing the fortune cookies before we sat down and we opened them up while waiting for the food, and like naughty children got to get another one when leaving. I had a huge take-out container and I kept thinking about that huge white container sitting in my breakroom fridge. If I was a cartoon character, it would be a series of panels doing a variety of activities while a big fluffy thought balloon of Tott's yellow curry."}

I'm very picky when it comes to pork fried rice (it depends on how the pork is cooked) and thanks to so many helpful Yelpers posting pics of their food, I was able to see that it was exactly what I was looking for. 

My boyfriend had the orange chicken which came with a side of fried rice, while I obviously went with the pork fried rice. The portions were great and we had food left over for the next day, however my rice was just a tad bland. I added a little saracha and soy sauce to give it some flavor and it helped quite a bit; next time I will make sure to ask for the rice to be cooked extra spicy. We will definitely be back (especially since this is about 5 minutes from our place) due to the generous portion sizes, perfectly cooked pork and very friendly staff."}

Hubby had the Orange chicken. He loves orange chicken and fried rice together but the rice felt was not complimenting the chicken.

This place is amazing because of the food and the very friendly customer service. The food is delicious and does not leave you with that " i ate so much, i need to throw up" feeling. The food isn't dripping with grease like most asian places.

The owner is such a nice man. I came here often when I was pregnant and everything sounded so good, I couldn't stop ordering. The owner (who i call Mr. Totts) would tell me to not order so much because the servings were so big. LOL who does that? He made me stop spending money, I appreciated that.

This was a first visit and as reported by other yelpers, the manager greeted me with a smile and affable chit chat about my 4 different chicken dishes! He made me feel like I was the only one there and he was happy to be of service. What, I ask you, could be bad about THAT?? 

We tried the Bangkok curry, orange chicken, bourbon chicken, sweet and sour chicken [mainstay for the kids] and the potsticker appy. Large portions all, I gotta say I loved the curry as I am a total curry suck-up; but all of the others were really good. Of the non curry, I'd say the Bourbon was my fave. Potstickers and sauce were deevine. Could have made a meal of just them and probably will on a return trip.

I ordered the Sweet and Sour Orange Shrimp along with the chow mein noodles.  There were actually 10 large shrimp in the delicious dish.  Wonderful orange peel flavor and was brought to our table in less than five minutes after being made fresh to order.  My wife ordered the Korean style chicken with the medium spicy sauce which was also cooked to perfection.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend this jewel in the rough and am looking forward to trying the wide selections of dishes offered."}

Pretty darn good! I haven't found many great Chinese restaurants since moving to AZ back in 2000 but I enjoyed this. Orange chicken with noodles and egg drop soup. Both where big portions and flavorful. 

Food is made too order and very fast. Love the smell of the wok cooking! 

Thanks for the ordering guidance"}

One appetizer and one main course fed two easily and the bill was $18.

New rule:  unless you are a chemotherapy patient or you live in Alaska, wool ski caps are not cool.  They only serve to make you look like Fred Durst.  And trust me, no matter what dorky haircut you have under that cap, it is infinitely sexier than looking like that guy.  Luckily, my food arrived before I yanked the beanie off Marky-Mark's head.

Maybe all the thai food has just destroyed my taste buds so thoroughly that all inferior asian cuisines are rendered tasteless.  Or maybe Tott's just isn't all that good.  I had the orange chicken with brown rice.  A more accurate description might read, "I had the carmelized sugar chicken."  It was so sweet that my stomach began to ache as I finished my 6th bite.  I had to leave my food unfinished.  Not because I was full but for fear of diabetes.

On the plus side, it's clean, fast, and the staff seem quite friendly."}

All the "Stir Fry Your Way"s are delicious.  I haven't made it to their curries yet, but I'm expecting greatness here too.  But one real standout is their Orange Shrimp.   It might not be the healthiest thing on the menu, and of course it tends to the sweet side, but it's hand-battered, and let me tell you, the breading is out of this world.  I don't know what they do to make it so rich and light at the same time, but the magic works.

This is not a large place and I sometimes wonder if I'm going to have a place to sit, but it's never failed me or my family yet.  The proprietor seems to always be there and I think his son runs the counter much of the time.  They're both wonderful hosts and they seem to have set a tone of friendliness and helpfulness with the rest of the staff.   It's a really nice, but no-frills atmosphere with really excellent food.

If you do, however, live or work in the area, I would highly recommend checking it for a fast and decent Asian lunch or dinner. And, yes, I use the word Asian, not Chinese - even though the dishes on the menu are primarily Chinese (although even that word is used loosely), the owners' inclusion of select Thai and Japanese dishes makes the cuisine more Asian than Chinese. Sort of like the food at Pei Wei, which just happens to be in the same center, but cheaper, more flavorful, and served with a little more heart. 

I was in the area picking up some medicine at our vet, so I thought I'd stop in and try one of Tott's lunch specials. Parking was a little tight in that particular part of the center, but I lucked out and found a decent spot that someone was pulling out of. When I went inside, I was impressed by the clean and simple decor - the red/black loft-like ceiling and tile backsplash behind the register were especially nice touches. 

I was also impressed by how amicable and helpful the GM was. When I placed my order (the $5.99 lunch special of Spicy Szechuan with tofu and brown rice) and asked how spicy it would be on a scale of 1 to 5 (since the signature chili symbol on a Chinese menu doesn't usually mean much), he took the time to explain that it was prepared medium-spicy and that if I really wanted to experience the full savoriness of the dish, I would probably enjoy having it spicy. He even added in a comment about how he approved of my choice since "spicy is good for the body"! Even though he was super-busy during the "lunch rush," I definitely appreciated his willingness to assist me in making my food the way I like it. 

I sat down and put my number card on the edge of the table, but I didn't have to wait long for my food. The GM came over with it just 3 or 4 minutes later. The portions of the tofu/veggies and rice were quite substantial, and I could see that the veggies were fresh by how crisp and colorful they were. I was also impressed by the flavor of the dish; while the sauce was definitely your run-of-the-mill Americanized brown gravy, the spiciness was definitely there and the tofu and veggies were cooked really well. When I was done eating, I felt satisfied but not too heavy. 

Tott's is a clean, friendly, and flavorful alternative to other fast-food Chinese joints or to Chinese restaurants offering lunch specials. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again."}

He's always there and lives on a cot located in the back room.

If you bring a date he'll know her by her name too and he'll have no qualms flirting with her. 

Still, shouldn't every Mom n' Pop restaurant in your neighborhood be like that? 

Tott's has more ambiance than your average Mom n' Pop place. I kind of see it as a small corporate place that just isn't named Pei Wei. After all, the restaurant is connected to Starbucks. 

Remember, this isn't a Chinese restaurant. It tries to cover the Asian gamut by offering some choices of Thai and Japanese food. You won't find sushi here, but you can get a big bowl of udon and there are a variety of thai curry sauces to choose from. 

I usually get take out from here but it's got an elegant little dining area and the outside patios with its metal tables really are quite nice when the weather allows. The dark wood tables and non-traditional flooring makes you feel like you're eating in a place fancier than you really are. 

Tott's has raised its prices more than once over the last few years though. Pei Wei moving into the same parking lot didn't help matters. 

Also, the workers who you see on the same regular basis are not nearly as friendly as the GM is. It's not that they're nasty, but you don't have to ask me my name on a take out order if I just paid with a credit card (with my name on it) or if I've been there (and seen you) multiple times that month. 

People I've taken there like his personal, friendly approach and enjoy the food. Tott's serves some non-traditional dishes though and it's not for everyone. 

Twins Pork has jalepenos and bacon. The Lo Mein has somewhat of a smoky flavor to it that I think blows YC's out of the water. Also, some of these dishes are spicier than people are used to at a Chinese restaurant. Other dishes are very thick and syrupy over meat (stir fried crispy beef). 

There are a number of items I really enjoy on the menu. I notice that portions differ though. My black plastic box on take out never seems to be all the way stuffed and lunch specials are made to be bigger than they are by giving you half a plate of rice. 

When prices go up and I feel I'm getting lesser portions I have an issue. 

I've also never heard of paying extra for friend rice with a lunch special until I started eating here. The brown rice, which is free, is good though. 

I don't eat here as often as I used to. It's tough to pay nearly $9 without a drink and not be completely filled up on a take out order. 

I find that some of the thai dishes tend to be very saucy and are more of a value. 

I give it 3.5 stars. A few years back I would have said 4.5, but it's just become less of a bang for your buck and in these recessionary times, that matters."}

Review:
I was originally drawn to this restaurant because of the variety of food they offer.  I was able to order Singapore Curry, Dragon Noodles (most like Thai), Malaysian Curry, and Spicy Island Chicken all under the same roof and they were all uniquely flavored and tasty.  At many places when a dish has a little red chili next to it indicating spice, it isn't really spicy but these dishes definitely had a kick to them, yum.  

The reason I give this place 4 stars is because the venue itself doesn't have much appeal although it is clean, and the food was a bit on the salty side.  However, the large portions, great variety, and overall tasty food make this place a great choice for your next group get together."}

we read some of the reviews here on yelp, and they could not be more accurate.  we both thoroughly enjoyed our respective dishes and took advantage of their 2 meals for $20 deal.  1 appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees and 1 desert for $20.  

the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and small but cozy.  there was a constant stream of people coming in for take-out.  

the appetizer was 3 nicely cooked spring rolls that weren't greasy and perfectly cooked inside.  they came with a sweet & sour dipping sauce that complemented the spring rolls nicely.  

my wife ordered the hong kong stir fry with chicken (sans the mushrooms) and i ordered the orange chicken (their most popular dish).  the portions are large...enough for 2 meals.  

the hong kong stir fry was delicious.  the chicken was white meat and cooked well and no 'strange parts' like you sometimes find in stir fry.  the veggies were big chunks and cooked just right...not soggy and not crisp.  the orange chicken was wonderful also.  it had a spicy kick that built as you ate more.  the sweetness from the citrus evened the spiciness out for the most part, combining for a tasty balance.  both came with large portions of rice.  

for dessert we ordered the almond cheesecake.  a perfect ending to our meal.  it was light and fluffy with a graham cracker crust that had almonds in the crust.  

tott's provided a great experience with great service and tasty food.   a local restaurant that we will definitely go to again."}

I really want to like this place because it's close to home, the service is friendly and fast, and it looks clean and well run. But the amount of sugar used is just bizarre. Today I got Twins Pork and there is more syrupy sweet sugar than pork (and they were generous with the pork). Before that, I got the Spicy Szechuan chicken, it wasn't quite this sweet but close. Funny thing is, I purposely ordered the pork dish because I figured there was no way they could make it that sweet. My bf got the Hong Kong rice noodles -- those were not sweet and they were really good.

Maybe you just have to experiment and find the right dishes here, but it still seems like an strange variation to be so heavy handed with the sugar. The other ingredients seem better quality than lots of Asian fast-food places."}

Here's the thing, the only vegetarian item on the menu is the Szechuan Tofu and Vegetables. A dish that is "meh" at best. 

All the others have either chicken powder (WTF?), oyster sauce or both, thus making 'em not suitable for vegetarians.

Also: Was told the spicy tofu was veg the first time I tried Tott's. Found out it was not on the second.

The bummer is, these are ingredients that could easily be subbed or omitted.

Nowadays, the vast majority of Chinese restaurants are very accommodating to (the growing population of) vegetarians. It is easy to substitute meat with tofu and have the kitchen leave the animal ingredients out. Tott's fails to make the effort.

If you are in the area and are looking for great take-out Chinese that is super accommodating to vegetarians, than I recommend a certain "Express" not too far North of Tott's. You won't be disappointed."}

I can't believe I waited so long to give Tott's a try.  Just a little background on my experience with Chinese food.  My mother was not a great cook and the only time we had anything even remotely resembling Chinese food was when she would crack open a can of that LaChoy Chow Mein.  It.  Was.  Awful.

I had to wait until I was in college to get some good Chinese food and a friend took me to Yen Ching's in Waterloo, IA and set me up with sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  Ever since then I've had a serious love affair with mongolian beef, and I'll get sweet and sour chicken if a restaurant does it up with the peppers, onions, and pineapple.  I've discovered over the years that very few places do that any more.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their pictures, I can see that Tott's does it correctly.

Right away I was greeted by the employees, and the dude who took my order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered my lunch to dine in, and then an order of pork lo mein to go, to take home for my husband.  

The restaurant isn't very big, but it's organized well and very clean.  My order of cheese puffs was so nice and light and the sweet & sour chicken was perfect.  I loved that the owner came around and introduced himself and when I told him I like how they prepared my lunch he said, "Isn't that the way everyone does it?"  Nope.  Absolutely not.  

The chicken was lightly breaded and fried and the flavors with the sweet & sour sauce and peppers, onions, and pineapple were delicious.  It tasted like they use a good quality sweet & sour sauce too.  Usually the sauces at most places are very syrupy and sugary, almost like someone did a Red Bull reduction, and I usually get heartburn after eating them.  Not in this case.  The sauce was nicely balanced and so far no heartburn.

With the cheese puffs, a fountain soda, the sweet & sour chicken, and the lo mein my total was $20.27 before tax & tip.  Excellent experience all around.  This is food and customer service as good as it gets for sure!  Can't wait to go back!"}

I tried several Asian restaurants I saw on Yelp! but everyone was just ok until I found Tott's Asian Diner. I wanted to try Tott's at least five times before I left a Yelp! review. Tott's has become my new go to Asian Restaurant and confidently I can call it the BEST IN CHANDLER!

Tott's is most importantly very consistent and has outstanding customer service! Everytime I have ordered pick up from Tott's the food is FRESH, HOT, and very FLAVORFUL. The portions are respectable and prices fair. My favorite entrees are the Chicken Pad Thai, Hong Kong Beef, Orange Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Vegetable Lo Mein, and Pot Stickers."}

No "bobo plates", no little sterno grill to burn your own food, no 70s "Oriental" restaurant ambiance.  This is the REAL THING.  Just knock your socks off, FRESH Asian cuisine to please many palates.  Want veggie?  There's LOTS of vegetarian options for you made to order and brought to your table fast.  Chinese?  Sure.  Japanese?  That too.  They even have pho and curry plates.  You'll get a satisfying mound of food for $10 including bottomless drink.  My only caveat: don't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with--this place is LOUD.  That's okay--you'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much.

Look, I'm from the SF Bay Area, where Asian joints abound.  This place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the Bay.  Best Asian spot so far that I've been to in the Valley.  If there's a better one, I have yet to find it.

Go.  Eat.  Stuff thyself."}

It was a really happy ending! Not the kind where you get sexual satisfaction, although eating good Asian food can be orgasmic, which is why they won't let me eat at the restaurant anymore, but the taste and morning after effects are always the key.

Good, healthy portions make it half the cost because it becomes two meals. Great place for a date or just sitting alone, moaning in pleasure, which is why they won't let me eat inside anymore.

Many delicious dishes and the gigunda pork egg rolls are huge and give me pleasure like no woman can, which is why no woman will let me eat in the restaurant anymore.

Plenty of parking and a coffee place next door, which oddly enough also won't let me stay inside anymore. I just sit in my car, facing towards the restaurant and eat my take out meal, moaning in delight and starring at female diners, while my van is a rockin'. Yes, I see you putting that egg roll into your mouth, lady. Oooooooh YES!

TMI? I can never tell."}

Honestly, this place has always been such a pleasant surprise. The food is consistently delicious - way better than you'd expect from a "fast food" Chinese establishment.

I've spent WAY too much time on the hunt for decent Chinese food during my time in AZ (about three years now), and have yet to find anything rivaling Tott's except for one place aaaaaaall the way up in Cave Creek.

That said, Tott's is about half the price of its closest competition and MUCH more conveniently located. They work fast, their service us always spot-on, and the food is always really really good (especially the Orange Chicken!).

I've never once eaten in, to be honest. I treat Tott's as my go-to take-out Chinese, even though I'm driving 20+ minutes to get there. (The fact that I'm driving so far for take-out Chinese should be pretty telling!)

If, like me, you're generally sad about the state of Chinese food in the state of AZ, give Tott's Asian Diner a try. I'm pretty certain you won't be disappointed. I never have been.

Thanks, Tott's, for being so awesome! See you again real soon!  :)"}

Where it falls is the quality of the food. I ordered 4 different things off the menu, way different - but in the end it was just sticky and quite tasteless. The chicken was rubbery, which sucked because 3 our of 4 items was chicken. The flavors was bland and consistency wise it was just not appealing.

1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Come in and expect Chinese-American food, NOT traditional Chinese food.  They also have a smattering of curries and Japanese food.

I ordered a couple things for lunch.  Pork rolls, basically pork egg rolls.  These were just OK.  They are VERY big, so decent value.  But the filling is mostly cabbage with very little pork, in this case they use BBQ pork.  I appreciate that the vegetables still had crunch to them.

Also ordered salt and pepper chicken with a side of broccoli instead of rice or noodles.  The broccoli was well cooked and left crisp, nothing special.  The salt and pepper chicken maintained its crispy breading but lacked a little flavor otherwise.  They use dark meat, which I appreciate.  Kept it moist and had more flavor.

There are things to like.  They have a list of quality controls that they use which is nice.  None of the food felt greasy at all (a far cry from Panda Express), they say no MSG, and some other  health-related stuff.  All that is well and good, but none of the food excited me.  It was serviceable fast-casual Chinese-American food."}

I've been looking forward to returning since our first visit because we all thought that the food and service was great. 

Unfortunately our experience tonight was less than satisfactory. 

When we arrived there was only one other table eating so I don't think that our experience had anything to do with it being a busy night. 

We ordered chicken lettuce wraps, sesame chicken, orange chicken and chow mien. The sauce for the sesame chicken was overly gelatinous and the chicken was over breaded and soggy.   I didn't taste any orange in the orange chicken in fact, if I had closed my eyes, I would not be able to tell which was orange chicken and which was sesame chicken.  All of the dishes were sweet and none of them had stand out flavors. I guess they use the same sauce in every dish?  The chicken lettuce wraps would have been the best item of the night IF totts provided enough lettuce cups in the order. Standard order serves 4 lettuce cups. We asked for more cups and were told that they charged 2.50 for 4 more lettuce cups. We're talking iceberg lettuce, come on. I always ask for extra lettuce cups whenever I order lettuce wraps and I've never been charged.  

My daughter found a bone in her chicken. When we were finished eating, my husband went up to the counter and told the woman who was up front about the bone. Her only response was "Oh, okay."  He came back to the table and rethought what happened and Went back up to the counter to ask to speak with the manager. The cashier said the girl he just spoke to was the assistant manager.  The assistant manager asked if she could help him. My husband stated that he was surprised at the way she handled the bone issue. She told him that they receive all of their chicken prepped so it wasn't the fault of the restaurant. My husband said that all he really wanted was an apology and recognition that there shouldn't be bone fragments in their food. She did apologize at that point and did comp the one dish
Which was nice of her. 

We all agreed that the food and service did not meet our expectations.  Not sure if our first experience was lucky or if this was just a bad night. Unfortunately we probably won't be back anytime soon."}

I would have to say that I would be really impressed with everything if I wouldn't have had an issue with my food. I got the honey walnut shrimp and it tasted as if it had been fried/cooked in old oil. It had a terrible after taste. I stopped eating it, it was that bad. I contacted the restaurant and Summer began defending the oil, stating that the oil is changed every day and my complaint had her scratching her head as to how this could happen. I was shocked at her defensiveness and thought to call and soak with a higher Manager in the morning as I felt I would get no where with her. 

If customer service is their focus, she didn't meet that expectation for me."}

As we approached the counter a man who looked like the owner or manager asked if we were ordering to go or for dine in. We said dine in and he quickly replied that we only had 20 minutes. What?!?! That was your first response. No "welcome to Totts, thank you for coming." Not only did we get the stern impression we were not welcome to stay, but we had 33 minutes before they closed, not 20. If they don't want to be there late then they should change their hours. We ordered and sat down. The good side was that we received our food quickly. Then as we were eating this manager just would stare at us from behind the counter. Clearly frustrated we were there. The food we pretty good which is why I am giving 2 stars, but what a horribly uninviting experience. As soon as we stood up from our chairs at 10:00 on the dot, they rushed over to take our food. This is a service industry, I wish this manager understood that."}

I have to admit, i was very satisfied and it changed my whole way of thinking about fusion restaurants.  I ordered the Singapore noodles with shrimp/chicken xtra spicy.  It was SPICY and loved it.  Usually when i order xtra spicy, it does not even make me sweat but theirs did :)  It was very flavorful and not greasy at all.  My only complaint was it needed more vegetables to balance out with the amount of noodles which is enough for plenty of leftovers.  My wife and kids ordered the Orange chicken which is another one of my querks as to me is not authentic chinese and is under the same category as General Tso.  Again i put my peeves aside and focused on whether or not it just tasted good.  I have to admit, i think i ate more of it than my Singapore noodles.  This place taught me a lesson in my food snobbery which i need to change and follow the words of Andrew Zimmern:  "If it taste good....eat it".  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes like the crispy beef and their curry dishes."}

My entree appeared, we waited, then my wifes entree, waited, then my soup, waited some more then finally the spring rolls - I don't get it, deliver the whole damn order at once!  Clean place, it was busy.  Fried rice was disappointing - make better fried rice at home (it was basically brown rice with a few random peas and carrots thrown in).  Soup was good.  Spring rolls were, well, like a spring roll should be - nothing special.  Twin pork was a bit disappointing, pork had a lot of fat on it.  Would I go back?  Maybe if I was in the area and wanted take out, but that's about it.

Awesome Food and Great Service! Young has always been really nice and so has the other staff.

The Highlights for me:
- Great Service! The staff has always been really polite and friendly
- The food is always Excellent and the price is really good for the portion you get. 
- Egg Drop Soup (only $2) - Always Piping hot and doesn't have nearly as much Sodium as other Asian places.
- Kung Pao Chicken - Great flavors, not too saucy and the Chili Peppers have a smoky flavor that I can probably pop them on its own all-day long. 
- The Curries - Bangkok & Singapore are really good! I usually get the Chicken or Beef and a side of brown rice. Much better then the local Thai restaurants who serve Curries. 

Overall, Glad I found them again and Keep banging out Quality food and great service!"}

My friend Vicky T. had tried this out and I know she has good taste, she's my friend. 

It was pretty busy when I came in and I grabbed a menu as I waited in line.  It's the same premise as Pei Wei.  You order and they bring it to your table.  They guys in the kitchen were working fast and furious to get things out.  I wasn't sure what I wanted so the young women asked me a few questions and made some suggestions.  I went with chicken broccoli and brown rice.  It came to my table about 5 minutes later, piping hot and fresh.  It was delish!!!  The broccoli was cooked perfectly, still a bit crisp, and the chicken was so tender.  The sauce used was also very good, a nice combination of a liitle sweet and a little sour with a small bit of heat.  Ya, I know, but I'm a wimp when it comes to heat.  I devoured it all!  

I watched as a steady stream of people came in, most got their food to go. The price point is about on par with Pei Wei too. I spent $10 for my lunch and a drink that was refillable.

The food is a bit different than regular asian restaurants.  It is in the same center as Pei Wei and the food comparable. The atmosphere doesn't compare to Pei Wei, but that's not a factor most of the time. I ordered a crispy noodle dish with veggies & chicken.  It was yummy.  The thing that struck me was that they used fresh, fresh veggies - like right out of the produce truck fresh.

The portions are very large for one person but some items are complete with starch, protein and vegetables. Entrees included Thai and Japanese types in addition to American-Chinese  and Korean dishes.

I had the chicken with veggies with chow mein; the rest of the group also ordered individually, not knowing that the items should be shared. So some food had to be taken home.  My food was not drenched in the usual oyster or other American-Chinese popular sauces but tasted, maybe a bit too much, of the cooking oil it was sautéd in."}

Been about half a dozen times now and never been let down. Usually get takeout as the interior of the restaurant is nothing special, very Panda Express. Staff is very friendly on the phone and in person. They have never screwed up my order. It's nice to have Tott's in my neighborhood because I really hate Pei Wei (there is one in the same plaza) and it makes me happy that Tott's can survive next to them.

The best thing about Tott's takeout for me is the fried apps actually remain crispy by the time you get home. How many times have you had a soggy spring roll or crab rangoon from other places? It's gross. I like chicken dishes the best, and my favorites are the spicy szechuan and the sesame.  I would not get the bourbon chicken again, it was dry and could have used more flavor. So yeah, if you want your Americanized Chinese food fix, come here and tell PW to suck it."}

We saw the Yelp Sticker and figured it was fate.... 
Tons of pan-Asian -fusion options.... suh-weet.

Spicy spicy me likey! 

This place has a kick which I love... I got the veggie panang with brown rice (call me a hippie). Tons of veggies, spicy curry and all was cooked perfectly. Snap peas, eggplant, large chunks of bell peppers, asparagus all mixed with some tofu. I greatly appreciate the fact there is an equal ratio of veggies... usually Asian spots will give you five million chucks of onions and not leave much else. 

The boyfriend got the crispy beef... it was a lil tough but the crispy and sweetness was a good combo with the spicy curry.   


Bathrooms are clean, 10% discount for students with valid (current) ID and the food is a good deal for what you get.... If you ever want to expand to California come to SANTA CRUZ!!!! I will be the first in line."}

Service: Outstanding

The owner saw that a group of people had arrived, and he made sure that we could sit together, even though all six of us were ordering separately. He was very friendly to us and answered any questions we had.

Atmosphere: Everything is pretty basic in terms of furnishings and design, but it has everything a restaurant of this type needs. There are umbrellas and space heaters outside.

Tender chicken and a well balanced sauce that wasn't overpowering with just enough spice. 

We also ordered the sampler plate, which was equally good, and fried rice. The fried rice doesn't taste NY style (says this native NYer) but still good nonetheless. 

The overall theme is simple, quality, well balanced flavors that don't overpower each other. You can taste each of the ingredients used in the dishes and there's a real harmony, which is a rarity. If your palate is used to cheap ingredients drowned in sauce to mask their quality and poor cooking technique, this isn't for you. Additionally, a single order is easily double the quantity that other restaurants offer. Definitely a winner for us."}

Got the Red Curry lunch with veggies, tofu, and brown rice. They had a great variety of veggies and they were cooked perfectly. Not limp, crispy without being too raw. Brown rice was perfectly cooked as well. Trouble was the curry. There was a layer of sauce on the veggies, as opposed to it swimming in curry. Which would have been fine except that there was a gritty texture, no silky coconut milk, no hint of fish sauce, and NO FLAVOR. There was not even a hint of heat, nor any other discernible spice notes. When has a curry ever been bland? I'm the wrong person to ask. I guess.
I also tried the chicken pot stickers. They wrappers had a weird texture, the filling was super bland, and the sauce they came with was just thin, sweet, and totally forgettable. 

Decor was inviting, it seemed clean, and the staff seemed fine (ordered carry out, my order was waiting for me when I got there, both the guy on the phone and the gal on the register seemed competent & friendly-ish)...

At least, your typical Americanized fast food fare. Tott's does not fall into that category...at all. Let me break it down by stars...

1st Star = It is NOT fast food crap. It is fresh, made in house, and tasty Asian fusion (influences that are Cantonese, Szechuan, Japanese, etc.)

2nd = They seem religious about cleaning up and having a very presentable atmosphere. While small, it is comfortable and inviting vs. the shit boxes your run of the mill take out comes from.

3rd = Friendly. My god were they all so friendly. The GM came by and talked with us for 10 minutes, the guy behind the counter was super nice and accommodating. They sincerely seem to care about their customers. 

4th = Portions are very generous. 2 entrees and and app and we took home leftovers

5 = Value vs quality. You will be hard pressed to find food this good and delicious for this kind of money. 

The pork rolls were amazing. 
The orange chicken is literally award winning.
I tried the walnut shrimp, just wasn't for me, but I can't ding them for my taste...it was expertly put together and the shrimp were friggin' huge! 

I'm sending the wife over there for lunch as we speak to grab the Salt and Pepper Crispy Shrimp...and some other goodies. 

Thanks Totts! Keep up the stellar work!"}

We had the Hong Kong with noodles, and the orange chicken. Both very good, with large portions, and competitive prices. Service was fast and you could tell the people cared.

Except Tott's improved on this dish by making it less greasy than it is traditionally made. It totally takes me back to NYC Chinatown and Flushing where I grew up eating this dish a few times a week. I wanted to call my mom while I was eating to tell her that I finally found an authentic and good Chinese dish in Phoenix but she was already in bed for the night. 

My fiancé had the Orange Chicken with fried rice and he enjoyed it. I tasted some and although Orange Chicken is a Chinese-American dish, I have to admit it was tasty nonetheless. I do a lot of Asian cooking since it is the cuisine of my culture and as far as I can tell that there are no questionable ingredients in the sauce, like weird thickeners, strange syrups, or MSG and whatnot. It tastes as homemade as you can get from a restaurant (not that any real Chinese person would make Orange Chicken at home).

The portions were huge. My fiancé eats like a horse, usually he polishes off his plate and the rest of mine, but this time he finished his dish and was too full to help me eat the rest of mine. I actually ended up taking home leftovers, that's how much food there was per order!  The quality of the ingredients was good, the chicken looks and tastes like chicken and the texture is of chicken.  Definitely a problem at other Asian dining establishments, but not an issue at this one.

The owner was on premises and he takes the time to talk with customers. He is willing to customize the dish to your liking. Feeling like 1/2 chicken AND1/2  beef? No problem. Extra spicy? Sure! No onions? Ok. I liked that.

I could not tell the ethnic background of the owner, but he does speak Cantonese like myself. So, this would go to say that perhaps the dishes that are not chiefly Chinese may not be to your expectation because they are not actually made by a true Korean/Thai, etc. and they may not be employing true Thai recipes or cooking techniques. I will give some of the Thai dishes a try at my next visit, but I have a feeling that the real standouts at this restaurant will be the Chinese dishes.

Place was clean and service was great. They have some really authentic dishes here, and now I feel like I don't need to bother going to those upscale fast food Asian chains anymore. They overcharge for the portion size that you actually get and the food isn't as authentic as they claim.

This place is a little far from my house but I'll definitely come back, I can't wait to try out other items on the menu!"}

One thing unique about this place can say is it's unintentional comedic irony. What am I talking about, you say? Most family owned Asian places have the tacky fake crystal lights and generic table and chairs but this place has attempted to go in a different but equally unoriginal direction by copying every detail of the interior of a Pei Wei Asian Diner! It's actually pretty hilarious once you think about it because there is literally a Pei Wei accross the parking lot from this place.

On to the plate, Ive ordered few different things but tend to order the "famous" orange chicken more often than anything. It is pretty good but the chicken is so breaded and the sauce so thick and flavor-neutral (if thats even a term, if not then Im making it one), that it I find myself bored with the dish after a few bites. I've gotten it with brown and fried rice, I'd say go with the brown because the fried rice is bland. One time, I attempted to liven up the orange chicken dish and asked them to add long beans to it, that was a mistake. The long beans are rubbery and cold and flavorless. 

I'll continue to go here but not as frequently. I wish I could say I'd found a place to permanently keep me out of Pei Wei but looks like this place will only sway me every once in a while."}

No MSG. Pure vegetable oil. Trimmed meats to reduce fat, and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks.

Easily my favorite fast Chinese in Arizona."}

I've dined in and carried out. I really enjoy the food here. I've tried a few different items, but my favorite dish is the Pan Fried Noodles served with beef.  The mixture of the noodles covered with beef, veggies and the oyster sauce is terrific. This item is FANTASTIC in my opinion! Each time I finish the dish, I wish I had more! 

The staff is super nice and always go over your order to make sure you receive the items you requested.

One item that I've tried that I wasn't keen on was the Tom Yum Soup. The soup was spicy, but was about it. Nothing filling about it.

The food has always came quickly when I've dined in. Both times I've picked up for carryout, the food was ready as advertised. The food is usually ready for pick up within 10 minutes of your order. 

The prices are very reasonable. Each main dish is generally between $6.50 and $9.00. Items with seafood will be a bit more expensive, maybe a bit over the $9 mark

A very good meal for under $10 (excluding drink)"}

Lo Mein noodles are my test of a good Chinese place and these were pretty good. Much better this time. We also got sesame chicken and that was tasty as well but a little too sweet and the meat was somewhat dry.  I also ordered pot stickers just for fun and those were delicious.  They got my order ready super fast and the staff seemed pretty attentive and friendly.

I still prefer Pei Wei for American style Chinese food but you really have to order ahead of time if  you are going to do take out since they are so busy all the time.  So, Tott's may become my go-to Chinese take out place now."}

Really reminded me of the ones I had growing up in NYC. Chicken wings very good. Crispy beef was very good. Beef lo mein ok, I would have liked bean sprouts and more scallions in it. Lemon chicken really disappointed. Not lemony although tart. More breading than I would want. Because the broccoli was not packed separately it became overcooked and soaked up a lot of the sauce. While this is a risk with take out it can be avoided easily by packing the vegetables separately for dishes like this. All and all we did like it and will go back."}

I finally made my mind to order their Orange Chicken and my bf was still thinking, then I looked at the man, he immediately told me 'oh that's ok! Take your time, no rush!!!' that was so nice of him! My bf ended up order their Kung Pao Beef. (we both ordered with Fried Rice)

The orange chicken was DELICIOUS, I like it a lot! I tried the Kung Pao Beef too and it wasn't bad. Orange chicken is more to the sweet side, Kung Pao is more to salty side with a little bit of spicy taste to it. But I was kinda disappointed with the fried rice, I wish they put more eggs and vegetables in there. As you can see from the picture, they cooked the rice with soysauce, that's it. I'm not saying it was bad, it really wasn't bad. But I just wish they put at least more eggs.

Overall, I love the service here! The food. The price wasn't bad either. I will be coming back next time to try out their other menu, but only if I am in the area though, hehe."}

As fellow Yelpers have mentioned, a sure fire bet is the Orange Chicken. Much tastier than Panda Express and Pei Wei in my opnion. Comes with your choice of steamed or fried rice. Also, if you request it, they will make it spicier for you as everything is made to order. 

Another good choice would be the Sweet and Sour Chicken, not as crunchy as the Orange Chicken but just as much flavor. It also comes with plenty of veggies and pineapple chunks, something that is really hard to come by at a place like Panda Exp. 

I think what really makes this restaurant better than some of your other fast food Chinese type locations is their friendliness and service. Every order I have made whether it be take out or dine in has been correct and really quick. Even with young workers behind the register, they are on top of everything and pay attention to your order. The owner is usually on hand cooking or serving which gives it a local feel rather than a chain. 

Check it out if your in the area"}

I've tried at least one dish from each country and they were alright. You get a good portion size. As for price, it's slightly above average. The service is great, and food comes out fast.

We ordered the Singapore noodles, pork rolls, crab wontons and yellow curry veggies.
Singapore noodles-so salty! Flavor was decent but I couldn't get past the taste of salt.
pork rolls-in my opinion, way too large with filling that is too chewy and hardly any pork. Mostly cabbage.  Pork that was present was chewy and dry.
crab wontons-decent but was sweet tasting, which I don't prefer. That's what the sweet and sour sauce is for.
Curry vegetables-loved the mixture of eggplant, peppers, onions, carrots etc. Was not overcooked which is where many other places make the mistake with vegetarian dishes. Curry sauce however, was massively disappointing. Not enough curry and too much corn starch to "thicken" the sauce. No no no.
ordering process was easy and food was ready when promised. 2 stars for this and for not over - cooking the vegetables as well as the generous portions. 
Most likely won't be back. I don't know why it's so difficult to find acceptable Chinese food in this area. Boo :("}

The take out lunch portion is huge! They put the peanuts on the side so you can add or omit as much as you like. There is a giant wedge of lemon inside the container.

I honestly can't understand why there are good reviews.

The customer service was bad. We ordered and paid online for takeout. When we arrived, the older Asian man there, (instead of greeting us or welcoming us to our first time in or something) scolded us for ordering via GrubHub. He said we need to call and not order online. He said GrubHub is only for delivery.

I imagine he's upset bc he pays a percentage to GrubHub. Unfortunately, in 2018, people like ordering online. If you don't want to allow online ordering for other than delivery, perhaps you can talk to GrubHub or another company about getting that for you. Uber Eats maybe? I dunno...but don't scold customers for spending money at your business. Maybe you could give a discount to people who call to order takeout or something. That might motivate them to do that. 

Biggest issue was that the food was gross. I bought $50 worth of food. About 90% went in the trash. We all agreed that it wasn't worth keeping. What a waste of money!

It was all dry... As if it was old or had been  frozen for too long or something. The flavor was bad. The texture was worse. The cream cheese in the rangoons was sweet...like cheesecake sweet.    The pork in the fried rice was chewy. The wings tasted like floor cleaning solution and a ridiculous amount of salt. The spring rolls were filled with a mush of vegetables. 

I'm very unhappy that I spent my hard earned money at this place. I will absolutely never be back.

I guess the good news here is that I won't be inconveniencing that guy with my online takeout order."}

It's insanely affordable, large portions, and NOT the hole-in-the-wall, mom & pop, lighted-pictures-of-the-menu-on-wall-against-a-floral-backdrop style place you've read about in Fortune Cookie Chronicles. (Which is a fantastic read if you like Chinese food & history.)

Instead, it's clean and modern inside, and Young, the insanely nice owner or brother-in-law of owner, is always very kind and generous and funny, to boot.

Now, the food. You'll need to check the menu before you order to make sure they have everything you're used to. While most Chinese restaurants all pick from the same playcard, Tott's bills itself as an "asian diner" and so standbys like moo shu pork are absent. To flesh things out, they add a handful of curries and some other pan-asian dishes you wouldn't normally see. (In the same vein, delivery service is also absent!)

Now that that's out of the way, ignore everything I just said and order the orange chicken. It is the best I have EVER had. (I make sure to order it "not crispy" since the shards-of-chicken approach is UNpleasant to me, which they abide by perfectly.) When it comes out fresh and uncrispy, there is no greater. It is just a bit spicy and has some red chile-type things in the sauce, so be prepared, or ask them to tone it down, but it comes out fresh, and hot, and amazing. 

Their chow mein is also fantastic. It's chow mein as it should be: soft noodles, not dry at all, and with tons of vegetables. I have them throw in shrimp, and they always include a big portion of just-right cooked shrimp.

I usually tap things out with an order of their great crab/cheese puffs. They're a bit light on the "crab" side, and might be "krab", but the flavor is amazing and their sweet and sour sauce is fantastic. Some of my favorite cheese puffs, pretty much ever.

If you dare order the pork rolls, a word of warning: they are an entire meal in and of themselves. They are the about as thick as your arm and there are two of them, served with sweet & sour mixed with spicy mustard. They are so big that they have to rubber band the foam container.

The portions are huge for dinner, and at about $11 each, you EASILY have two meals out of them.

Take the time to hit up this place for a different take on great chinese food. And if you ask Young for the orange chicken, not crispy, don't be surprised if he thinks you're me. (That's usually how he recognizes me!)"}

They have my favorite Orange Chicken and I think that their service is always awesome.  So I'll give them the extra star because it seems great service these days is harder to find than great food - not to mention at a great little neighborhood location.

The owner always says hello and will make custom orders if asked.  It is one of my favorite lunch spots as the food is always made fresh, fast and friendly - which are my 3 keys for a great lunch.  I have also had great experiences when I have called ahead to pick up food.  I like to get the dinner size for lunch turn it into two meals."}

To me, tacos to Mexican food are like chips to a sammie: you might get a taco on a combo plate, but the reason you ordered the meal was for something bigger and better. The taco? It's just a little more than a condiment. That said, I have no idea what drove me to order the 3-tacos (ground beef) w/ rice and beans on the side, but I think I was hoping for an unlikely gastric event -- a really tasty taco.  I won!!!  Crispy tortilla that was consistent throughout, and the remaining shell held its molded structure and didn't shatter like broken glass when you took a bite. I like that. I also appreciated that the taco was filled w/ meat, more so than lettuce, cheese and tomato. I like my taco old school, and the ground beef was flavorful and not dry.  The aforementioned dressings were chilled and fresh. Crispy, tasty goodness. I should have ordered 3 more!

The rest of the meal? Not too shabby. I liked the refried beans, but the rice was really salty. Also, my buddy grabbed the salsa (well, it was more of what I would call a "red sauce"), so I don't know if there were multiple options, but I prefer a chunky salsa over a sauce. Still, it had a good flavor and was not overpowering as a condiment. Guacamole was okay, and the portion of the side order was plentiful. Regrettably, I found the chips to be a tad over done, and too thick for my liking (I enjoy a lighter chip, cooked in fresh oil).

All in all, a really good meal, complimented by friendly service. I'll be back for the tacos . . . 

Cheers!

I had two tacos, one shredded chicken and one shredded beef. They came with fluffy flour and corn tortillas respectively. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the salsa was a wonderful blend of spices. It packed some heat. The beef was also juicy and flavorful and the pico on top had diced jalepenos, which added substantial heat. I would ask for no pico next time. The meat on both could have been drained a little better. Spouse had an egg and chorizo burrito - all day breakfast FTW- and said it was a nice blend of proteins and spicy goodness.

Today we finally stopped.  We orders enchiladas, taco, tostada, chips and chirps to taste a bit of everything.

Price per person: average $10 
Meals:  served with Refried beans and rice and topped with light lettuce and tomatoes
Service: order at cashier
Food quality:  score 4 out of 5 as the ground beef was very greasy and the tortillas shells cooked were mushy and burned on the bottom.

I was given a replacement meal for the burnt bottom.

A few things to consider:

- The rice has tomatoes and onions for those who are subject to fussy.
- ground beef is relatively greasy "but" flavored well.
- Red salsa is basically HOT sauce and I was not able to eat any of it.
- Green chili (sauce for meals choice) was mild to most but still spicy for me, you can ask for light or on the side.
- Excellent $2 margaritas.
- if you want extra containers to take stuff home there may be a charge.
- bathrooms are outside and unisex.
- probably can't go wrong with taco Tuesdays.

Over all I think it's a good "find" and has something to please everyone, even me who can do spicy."}

Not sure we will ever return again though unless in area and it's convenient. Ordered 4 bean burritos, all without cheese and 2 with pico. Two burros broke open upon first grab, after waiting 20 minutes for our order. Granted it was a Sunday at around 1pm and busy, had to wait to ask for extra tortillas to double wrap tortillas and by time done fixing the busted open burros my burro was cold, and then broke open as well. Beans tasted authentic and bonus for vegan friendly (no lard yay) but made for a sad dining experience that was meant to be a treat out for birthday."}

First off I love eating at Espos and have been for many years. This review is not meant to bash them but to make others aware of what happened to me. The food itself is actually one of my go to for takeout Mexican food. 

On Friday November 24th my family was over so we ended up ordering takeout from Espos which equated to about 8 plates of food with chips and salsa. 

Everything tasted great as usual from Espos. We were not able to finish all the food and a untouched beef Enchilada combo plate was left over. I decided to take the untouched combo plate for lunch at work on Monday. During lunch break when I was about to take my second bite. I noticed a large screw inside the shredded beef. No joke pictures below. 

I was not upset but concerned for others chipping teeth on metal. I contacted Espos and the female on the other end said they were missing several screws from a device used to cook or slice tomatoes. After describing the screw she apologized to me and offered free food. My goal wasn't to get free food and frankly was not hungry for Espos at that time. 

I wanted to warn them about the metal and potential injury to customers. Sounded like they were aware of missing metal screws and she told me it was not just one screw but several. 

In talking to the female at Espos I asked her if she wanted me to bring the screw in. She said she would really like that. The next day I took it to the restaurant and asked for the manager. The female cashier said the manager was busy and I showed her the screw. This was the same employee I spoke to over the phone and  told me the manger was upset and never took down my name or any information. 

Even though I love the food it's disappointing that it happened."}

Chips: 3 stars...fresh, but a little too thick for me
Beans: 4 stars...hearty, fresh, and nice flavor 
Tostada: 5 stars...lots of fresh lettuce, cheese, and beans.  Would order this again.
El Jefe burrito: 1 star...Booo!  :(  It is Carne Asada with green sauce + cheese + pico.  It was waaaaaaaayy too salty.  Neither my husband or I finished it.  Would not recommend this even though the cashier did.  My husband said he'd give it a 2, but I'm writing the review so...
Portion sizes: 4 stars...large

All in all, I may go back for the bean tostada and salsa.  Nervous to order more meat given the salty carne."}

I stood in line & paid. Then I sat down directly across from the register & waited. As I started hearing order numbers called off I took another look at my receipt to make sure I wasn't going crazy, sure enough my number had not yet been called & the new numbers were steady getting larger & larger (than mine). The young lady behind the counter said nothing to me until I stood back on line to cancel-she must have sensed my agida when she said 'Isra, I see her wrapping your order now - she had to re-make it' 
I grabbed my order & when I arrived home was really annoyed to find that my enchiladas were flat & food was not secured in its packaging. The top was loose & had shifted into my food!
I'll have to see how I feel about visiting again because my tolerance for poor customer service is really low. The food is good but not worth this kind of hassle - I waited about an extra 10 minutes after I called ahead. What sealed it for me was the hostess lack of attention until I stood up to get ready to leave - she totally could have said across the countertop, 'hey they had to re-do' or any number of things... we'll see what happens going forward."}

We have been to the restaurant a few times for lunch. It is usually busy especially on taco tuesday, prepare to wait a little bit in line and to find a seat. You can sit outside but with the AZ heat many people sit inside where there is only about 7 tables. The tacos are good but spicy with their pico de gallo, so I usually get it on the side. The tortillas usually fall apart which is a disappointing mess and thats with meat and pico only so not much weight inside. Many people get burritos which look awesome so that might have to be the go to from now on."}

It was a busy Sunday afternoon at Espos but the line moved fairly quickly. 

We had the El Chapo burro and the carnitas burro. The El Chapo was filled with green chile beef, potato and cheese. I loved the green chile and the spicy kick to it which was about maybe 6/10 on the spiciness scale for me. The potatoes were a bit mealy tasting though and I would have liked an extra texture such as the addition of onion or pico de gallo to contrast with all the soft textures of the burro. The carnitas was decent, filled with slow cooked pork. The pork was moist as if it were cooked in a pot rather than roasted or fried like how I've encountered other carnitas in other restaurants. 

The shop is pretty small with a few tables inside and a cute patio outside with more tables. 

Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'd definitely stop by again to try more off their menu."}

Went on a Saturday night, party of 5. This is a order at the counter and they call your number. Place was busy and line was out the door most of the time. We were excited because the reviews were great and had high hopes. 

My girls had a quesadilla and chips with melted cheese and salsa. I specifically asked the guy if the salsa was on the side because and he said yes. The quesadilla was huge but I was disappointed that my other daughters "chips and cheese" had jalapeños all over it. She's four and will not eat that so we picked it all off instead of sending it back as the line was still out the door.

Two of us ordered the taco salad with ground beef and it was just ok. Wish we ordered sour cream and guacamole because it really had no taste. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas, 2 ways. Both green and red sauce was good. I munched off his plates. 

With the order comes a huge bucket of chips but I wish they gave it to you when you order and sit to wait for your food. We did not touch any of it and felt bad for wasting a whole bucket of chips. 

We tried ordering the fried ice cream but they said they didn't have it and they needed to take it off the menu. Not sure if they no longer will be serving or just out for the night? We ordered the churros for a sweet treat after we were done and it was the best part of my meal. 

Tons of Mexican restaurants around so I can't say we'll be back."}

Carne Asada Burrito Enchilada Style with Green Sauce is amazing. The old Red Salsa is the same. Flavorful and hot. We also tried the Chicken Enchilada's. For some reason it was cubed and not shredded chicken. Good but not as good as shredded and I hope they bring that back.

It was packed for lunch today and I hope they are on the right path to stay open another 25 years.

The portions were very large and price seemed to be of good value. I had guacamole added to my chicken a la carte tostada and they piled it on. It tasted homemade and was good. As far as what my bf ordered, he said it was average, though again, large portions. The hot sauce was a little hot for my liking, but I'm somewhat of a hot sauce whimp!! 
I would probably come back to try one of the salads. It was a fun relaxed environment and provided outside seating. Nothing fancy. The staff was friendly and I liked the antique decor. They do not have a wait staff...it is order and pick up."}

It is really frustrating when you place an order ahead, and not only to be forgotten about, but completely neglected. When we got the food, it was overcooked and tasted horrible. It was clear they rushed, since they likely forgot about us. (The girl told me three times the food was being wrapped up.) I will be reaching out to the owners for a full refund. IMO you can get a better breakfast burrito at Adablertos. BEWARE!"}

We took the leftovers home thinking maybe the flavors would intermingle and be more evident the next day......nope still bland and lacking taste.

They don't have anything close to this where I am from in the Pacific NW.  My physical therapist turned me onto this place (I hurt myself moving three large rolls of carpet onto a roof and through a second story window, but I digress).  I was staying at my family's VRBO in Prescott with my father and drove down to PHX for the Business Center Costco to stock up on supplies.  I decided to hop on over to Chandler to try this place out for dinner.  I am sure there are better places, or maybe not, but how often do you get personal restaurant recommendations from a local 1,200 miles away .

I got:  the Machaca, carne asada and carnitas tacos; the green chili beef chimichanga; and a cheese and Machaca enchiladas.  I have nothing but positives to say about the food.  The cashier was a bit short with me, but I can't blame her.  Being new I was as quick with my order as possible, but that was probably pretty slow and this place was slammed most of the time I was there.  Mostly with to go orders.

I may have to drive 1,200 miles to try this place, again.  It will be so worth it, though."}

I received 3 soft shell carne asada tacos instead of 3 crunchy ground beef tacos, no tamale and of course an order of 3 plain chicken flautas were soggy beyond belief because of the extra lettuce and tomato that was requested not be there in the first place.

Tired of looking for good Mexican food in a place that should offer it on every corner, we often don't bother anymore. Espo's, as you will read in their Yelp write-up, existed for 40 years in this same location until some time back and then was reborn this last year. We found it a few months after its re-opening and it was packed with a variety of folks, many of whom had apparently just found it as we had. Yesterday we were there again and noticed how many of the patrons were of Mexican descent--a very good sign. The food is the best you'll find for 20 miles in any direction and very reasonably priced. I tend to stick with what I like, so I can only directly speak for the tacos and the chimis. Staff is super-friendly, vibe is warm and cheerful and decor is simple old-world rustic.

I had to have my red tamale plate with a taco like usual. Taco Tuesdays are in force with $2 street tacos and $2 beers catering to the ASU college crowd. The red sauce was as hot as ever making this gringo sweat big time, and I loved every minute of it.

I have now gone 3 times and each time, I have been disappointed.  The first time I went, I had a carne asada taco that while flavorful fell apart because it did not have a very substantial tortilla.  And what they call flautas are what everybody else calls taquitos-nothing special here.

On the second occasion, I went for Taco Tuesday.  Upon entering, there were two people ahead of me and I noticed that all the employees were eating lunch.  Not one person bothered to get up and take the orders. We had to wait  a good 5 minutes until the girl was done playing with her cell phone to order.

I ordered a ground beef taco and when it arrived, I saw that they didnt even put lettuce or tomato in it.  It was simply ground beef in a tortilla-that's it.  There was a salsa bar but I was not too impressed with the flavors of the salsas.  My other tacos were alright-nothing amazing.

On the third occasion, I ordered a beef machaca chimichanga.  While it came with sour cream and cheese, they didn't even bother to melt the cheese on the chimichanga.  I honestly have had better chimichangas at Garcia's-which pains me to say.  Oh, I also had big chunks of gristle in the meat. Yuck. Yuck . Yuck !

A shining gem?  Give me a break."}

From the parking lot your not sure what to expect but once you walk in it's really clean and quaint. It does have a tendency to get extremely busy around lunch so I would go a little before or later to avoid the rush. You order at the counter and seat yourself until your number is called. 
I ordered the beef green chili chimichanga and it was amazing! I could have done without the sour cream or had it on the side because it was a little much. I also really enjoyed the flavor of the salsa.

Craig: It was a little pricier than Filiberto's, so my recommendation is go to Filiberto's. 

Me: Yeah, it was okay food in a decent setting, but I can't give it more than 3 stars. I don't think I'd come back since there are Mexican restaurants that are four or five stars for me.

Me: Craig, you need to come up with things beyond "Yeah."

The good news is that it seems clean, is decorated nicely, and service was fast. They have a fairly large patio area to enjoy. The food itself was a mixed bag though. The tortillas themselves are good quality. My carne asada was neither good nor bad- just decent. The beans had a nice flavor but were on the runny side. My son wanted to try the flour tortilla chips, but neither of us liked them at all. I think corn tortilla chips are the way to go. The salsa was given a thumbs up by my son though.

I really just wanted $1 tacos - which are only $1 if you get the 10 taco deal, and It's $1.50 if you don't. They also have a 3 tacos plus a drink for $5.00. I think the best deal in the house is their margaritas ($2) and beer buckets (5 bottles for $10). 

Parking was pretty packed when I arrived (not the smallest of parking lot either) with 2 open lots. Entering through the gates, I can see why this place brings in a crowd on Tuesday. On the patio, they play lively Latin music as everyone enjoys their drinks and food. The line was not too long - the friendly staff works fast to get orders in, but getting orders out took maybe 20 minutes (not a bad time considering how packed it was). Getting a table was hard as well. You have to be ready to pounce on a table once it clears.

The food. If I wrote this review alone on just the food, and not considering the price, it would probably be only 2/5 stars. I had the mango peach fruit drink (pretty good, a little too watered down), 4 grilled chicken, 4 carne asada, and 2 carnitas. The tortillas are okay, nothing special. I personally like that they were not too soggy and didn't break so easy. I thought the chicken was going to be just GRILLED, but the final product was shredded chicken soaked in a broth. Carne asada seemed like it didn't get a good sear, and it possibly was rushed too quick or soaked in juice too long. Carnitas were the best, but I mean it's carnitas... always good - this one had nothing special to it. Lots of salsa and toppings to choose from; all were about medium spice. The lighter green sauce had more tomatillos sour to it, lighter red sauce has a stronger tomato base, dark red sauce is thicker with spices, and dark green sauce had a stronger hint of maybe oregano or cumin (was my favorite, especially on the chicken)."}

Being from the midwest what I know as Mexican isn't exactly the same as what I am finding out here in the desert southwest!   I was surprised to find so many "chain" restaurants and not as many authentic Mexican ones as I expected to be out in this area of the country.   Espos is a delightful little place to eat and I must say the food was exceptionally good!  It is nothing fancy, and somewhat small but the cooks know what they are doing when it comes to preparing Mexican cuisine.   I came on a Wed. around 1:30 in afternoon to miss the crowd, since I was alone.  You could tell they had been busy but the place was still well kept.  There are no floor servers, you go up to counter and order off of a huge wall menu then find a table.   They have EVERYHIING!!  I was so happy to find cheese dip! Not easy to find out here but all mex places back in Indiana serve it.  Didn't have to wait too long for my food.  I had the chicken/onion burrito with cheese dip and salsa/chips.   I was only able to eat half of it and took rest home.   The prices are very reasonable and most items are ordered "a la carte" style.    I am sure going to return here again in the future.   As the weather is finally cooling down I am looking forward to sitting out on their spacious patio,  perhaps in the evening sometime soon.

Same menu as before but laid out very nicely in the front of the restaurant. Same type of ordering process, order at the front, they call your number when your order is ready. It looks like they no longer have a liquor license which is no big deal to me and I don't think it will be detrimental to the business, the food speaks for itself.

I had two machaca beef tacos which were delicious. Espo's does machaca beef so well. The green chile beef is a staple here and great in both burrito form as well as chimichanga if you are being adventurous. Service was great.

Pretty packed too but it didn't take long for our food.  I ordered the taco burrito, ground beef cheese and lettuce wrapped in a tortilla.  Pretty good for the most part. My husband had the enchilada platter that was pretty tasty. I love the homemade Mexican rice and beans.  Next time I want to try the taco salad or a chimichanga.   I saw a couple of those orders go out while I was there and they looked pretty tasty.  Prices here are good and the salsa is pretty awesome too.

The seating area is very limited, suggest going early to have someone reserve your table. I watched a family get in a fight with another one over a table. 

Their taco Tuesday is pretty awesome. 10 tacos for $10. A bucket of beer bottles (I think 6?) are $10. We ordered 10 tacos, nachos with guacamole, and their cinnamon something chip things (THEY ARE AMAZING BTW) Your tacos will come w just the meat, so make sure you grab the condiments in the tiny little stand inside. 

The food was absolutely delicious. Explains why it's hard to find parking, seating, and the crowd. Well, I did go on a Tuesday ..... but nonetheless. OH. MY. GOSH. THIS PLACE IS THEEEEEEE. T.H.E. PLACE!!!!!! If you buy your alcoholic beverage outside, there's NO tax. So buy you drank outside.

Sorry I didn't take pictures, I was too busy stuffing my face. :P"}

The exterior is a bit off-putting, but I promise it's well worth the stop. Be prepared to fight for a table inside or to sit on the outside patio as the interior of the restaurant it fairly small. Parking can be a little hectic as the lot is a bit awkward and small. 
The service at Espo's is always quick and friendly. You can expect your food to be ready in a matter of minutes. Honestly, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My personal favorites are the tamales, any of the tacos and the enchiladas. The posole is a can't miss when it's available. The portion sizes are great especially when considering the price. Everything is always warm and fresh and absolutely delicious. 
Seriously, just go. You won't regret it."}

I guess "technically" I did too, but we won't get into that.  ;) 

Sure, we heard all of the epic stories about their incredible machaca and legendary green chile options and Christmas tamales, but despite the SUPER close distance, we never made it in. 

Sad trombone when they closed. :(

... Until Espo's reopened, woohoo! Let's remedy this with an afternoon off work!

It's a humble, small restaurant. All signs pointing to, "Prepare to be domerocked!" 

Don't expect anything fancy or sit down; if you're seeking that, do us a favor and drag your hoity toity self to the Biltmore. 

Now that that's out of the way ... What to expect? 

Freaking AMAZING food. 

We shared the El Jefe Burrito. Steak, cheese, jalapeños, I think there was Pico de Gallo and red salsa. 

Super delicious and filling! The steak was tender and the flavors worked well together. 

Although after reading Jay M.'s review (and looking at pictures) I immediately regretted not getting it Chimichanga and Enchilada style. 

The guacamole is also fresh and out of this world! 

A word of warning though, do not order it if you struggle with spice. 

Thanks to cooking for a Latino man for 5+ years, I went from "Taco Bell Mild Sauce is painful!" to "WTF is this?! Have her bring more chilies, hon!" (While eating Thai Hot Pad Thai at the supposed highest level of spice!) Let's just say my eyes were running rivers after each chip. Delicious!

Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. 

I'm soooooooooo sorry I overlooked you, Espo's - Don't ever leave Chandler again!"}

I don't really like to drink soda, but the girl at the counter was getting impatient that we were asking and she insisted there was only one deal they offered. Not even a big deal, we had the carnitas and carne asada tacos - and hell-yah! the salsa bar is very, very cool.  Must have been 5 or 6 different sauces, pickled onions, roasted serrano peppers, lime wedges, cilantro, chopped onions.... there was more but I forgot to snap a pic. One more important mention: the house salsa provided with the tacos was not to be found on the salsa bar....but it was soooo good, you not belief!!! As far as I could tell, there was lots of oregano in it, but not in an Italian way! Super-tasty, Ima return sooon with $10 and gets me a TACO PAR-TAY! Um, fiesta, por favor.

I cook my own Mexican food which I learned from my Mexican grandmother. This place is very close to authentic. Great rice, fair beans (watery and a bit salty), delicious tacos with tasty meat.

I ordered the Veggie Burrito enchilada style with Red Sauce. It was yummy! Also, I did mention to my sister, "it's a little salty," but I didn't mind it. We also ordered the guac and salsa chips. Guac was creamy and exquisite!

Cons:  

No salsa fresca bar.  I love pickled Jalapenos and carrots, but they do not have any.

I ordered two chicken tacos.  I got two ground beef tacos.

Pros:

Even though they gave me the wrong tacos, the ground beef had a great flavor!  The amount of meat in it was pretty hefty as well!  Really, really good tacos!

I got the El Jefe burrito as well.  Not your traditional carne asada.  This is with cheese and green chiles.  Kinda heavy, but fantastic flavor!   Absolutely worth a return trip!!

I got my son a couple bean and cheese burritos, and he loved them.

There are so many positive reviews of Espos.  Almost certain our flauta plate was frozen not long before being served.  The centers of the flautas were ice cold.  Ice cold chicken.  Hmmm.  Had them remade.  The second batch was hot, but tasted like cardboard.   The enchilada plate sauce was delicious, but the cheese enchiladas themselves...well, after a couple bites that exposed the center of the enchilada, it was just a hunk of unmelted shredded cheese out of a bag.  Unmelted.  Just a lump of shredded cheese.  I could have done a better job of melting shredded cheese at home.   Moving on, the refrieds would have been tastier if they had come out of a smaller can.  Seriously they were just flavorless brown mush.  

The chips with melted cheese were fine, but greasy.  The salsa was spicy.

The inside is very unassuming and kind of what I thought it would be looking at it from the outside.  The ONLY challenge I've had with this awesome place is sometimes the tables are rather sticky. Other than that the place is immaculate.  My wife is a fan of the chicken enchiladas, and so far, I've tried everything "chime style"...chicken, chili (red & green) and Carne Asada (my favorite so far).  This is one of those go up to the counter and order kind of places, and if you time it just right you'll miss the crowds...and it does get crowded seemingly out of nowhere.  The service is fast, the pricing is very reasonable and the staff are all very friendly.  Salsa (red) is decent but maybe a little too much oregano for my taste, but the green salsa is really good!

Julie was very friendly and helpful. As soon as I said it was my first visit, she offered samples. That helped me decide between Green Chile and Machaca Beef. Both tasted great, but I gave the nod to the Machaca. The beef was tender and oh so flavorful! I was also undecided between a standard burrito or enchilada style, and the staff recommended that I get it plain.

My order came quickly. The tortilla was fresh and tender, and the burrito was incredible! Very moist and well spiced. Next time I'll try the Green Chile, maybe enchilada style.

Also offering tacos, flautas, tostadas, quesadillas, taco salads (and supra), enchiladas, chimichangas, and beers to ensure you get your money's worth.

Speaking of money, their prices are very good for the quality and portions. Friendly staff welcomes you with warm smiles as they take your order from the counter.

Quite a bit has changed in the past 2 years, and it seems like its all for the better. Espos food tastes like your 90 year old grandma is in the back cooking for you, and you alone. The food is savory, filled with depth and flavor, and feels unique. There's no shortage of taco shops in Arizona, but Espos has done something completely different and is what I would call "Mexican Soul Food".

The menu is a little daunting and complex, but its essentially 4-5 different fillings (green/red chile shredded beef, carne asada, chicken, etc) in 4-5 different shells (chimichanga, burrito, enchilada, tacos, etc). There are plenty of combinations to keep things interesting and fresh. Based on Yelp reviews/pictures it felt like the consensus was to go with a chimichanga, and since green chiles are apparently in season, my final choice was a green chile beef chimichanga. I owe a lot to my fellow Yelpers who guided me to a blissful destination. I've never been so happy in my life. The deep fried chimichanga is crispy on the outside, hot on the inside, and topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream. Despite being deep fried, it doesn't feel too heavy. The homemade salsa is smoky and complex in flavor. It brings enough heat to satisfy even the most insane chili freaks, but it provides enough depth to those who are averse to spices and are likely to use salsa more sparingly. I was a little disappointed on the amount of beef in my burrito as it was combined with beans, but I'll live. My uncle on the other hand probably got too much chicken in his chimichanga, so maybe I just need to get that next time?

I loved it so much I came back for breakfast a few days later only to see they weren't open at 8 am. I should have checked the hours. Overall, this is a great place to hang out with some friends and enjoy an amazing meal."}

Yes, the food and service is good, but not really 4.5 stars good. 

The prices are cheap, the food is tasty but it's just the standard fast food Mexican that's squarely a 3 star deal. 

We had:
The Machaca chili plate with spicy green chili sauce on the side. The green chili sauce was HUGE and flavorful and very spicy. Probably the best thing that came out. The refried beans were tasty and salty and had a good amount of cheese. 

Machaca tacos were fat and full of meat, cheese and veggies. Very tasty. Hard crispy shell!

Carne asada and Carnitas tacos were a bit smaller than the Machaca and were served on soft corn tortillas. Less veggies (salsa Fresca style). 

The burritos were big and full of ingredients. 

Chips and salsa were fresh. Salsa had a nice kick but the serving size was tiny! The guacamole was really plain, I'm pretty sure it wasn't real avocado. 

We ordered 5 flautas but only got 3 and my Machaca taco was missing until I asked for it. 

The bathroom was clean and the outside has a nice patio to sit at.

In summary, it's a solid 3-3.5 star experience. It's fast food homestyle Mexican. Nothing great, nothing bad. But don't take anyone here on a date or for a family reunion!! 

I didn't take pictures bc there really wasn't anything photo worthy to show."}

I ordered the Green Chile Plate and it was AMAZING.  The flavor of the green chiles was on point.  The portions were large and I should have saved half of it for later.  Unfortunately I could not put my fork down and devoured the entire meal.  A nap was the only thing I needed after this meal.

After driving by so many times and seeing a full parking lot but always on my way to appointments or what not and just too busy to stop. Well, today I was finally in a place to stop and see what Espo's was all about! It was about 6pm and the line to order was already long. I geared up because I was hungry and just knew that this was going to be good! While waiting I noted that the patio was cute and decorated for upcoming Cinco de Mayo. Super festive! What I didn't like is that it's walk up counter service and there were no menus which in my opinion would be great for those waiting in a long line; trying to decipher a board menu can be blinding! My husband actually pulled a menu from Yelp while we waited. I have to admit, I am not one for counter service and wanted to maybe leave but I felt bad to go after asking my husband to turn around to come here. We finally get to the guy who took our order. He was less than enthralled with us. Whatever. I guess that's what you get with counter service. The water is set up in a big decanter by the doorway. Mind you the cups they give you are that of the dental office 'flush and spit' type. You may as well take as many as your hands will carry. Would it kill you to hand out bigger water cups? This is Arizona and it's 'authentic' Mexican food, right? You can tell I'm getting a bad taste in my mouth.. and the food has yet to arrive. We sat on the patio. I noted the beers seemed cheap. About 20 minutes later out over a speaker our number is called. Our order of chicken flautas and cheese enchiladas is ready. My husband collects it and it's in foil tins. So much grease is floating on the enchiladas that are souped in beans. We also got an order of chips with 'queso' and salsa. The chips and 'queso' are simply a few tortilla chips with melted shredded cheese on a paper plate. Bleh. The salsa is in small cups and it wasn't tasty. Our rolled tacos were frozen in the center and we took them back to Mister Un-enthusiastic. Did he care? No. The cheese was not melted inside the enchiladas either but at that point, we gave up. When they called for us to come get the rolled tacos .. again here came the bellowing ,'5 PIECE FLAUTA!' Across that noisy, impersonal speaker. Don't you think an error such as serving us uncooked food would have warranted a small act of kindness or decent customer service like bringing us the rolled tacos ? Guess what ? It's didn't. These were burned crisp and the two that were edible .. tasted like frozen , old , stale, rolled, used to be frozen tortillas. Hard. Pass. I would rather eat at a popular greasy taco shop known here in the valley that has better food than this IF I am going for the American-ized version of 'authentic' Mexican food. I don't even have to keep walking to tie water decanter there with my small dental sized cups! That's a joke, when saying it's 'authentic' , right ? Authentic for who??? So the cute patio.. it's cute. To me, that's all this place has going for it.  So many taco shops in the area ... keep driving and don't believe the hype. But I am only one Yelper that doesn't seem to believe this hype. This is my story and I'm sticking to it. Terrible."}

Had the carne asada burrito and I was not impressed at all. Firts if you are going to classify the meat as "asada" it can't be boiled. Well after this experience I don't care to try anything else here. Don't know what they hype is about. It's not that complicated to make decent food. All four people in my lunch group agreed, bad choice. We should have just did sushi."}

We quickly made a u turn and came back.  Yelp reviews were good so I walked in first to see and plates in the tables that looked yummy!  The cashier was lovely but looked overworked but still she was very nice.  Ordered chicken taco salad, green chili burrito chimi and a machaca chile enchilada style.  One chili came plain and not enchilada style when I took it back the gal that came to take it back seemed annoyed .  minutes later she came and tossed the the tray back over the small counter with horrible look at me.  The tray had cheese all over before I could think of snapping a pic I had gathered it up on my tray.  But here's a pic anyways.  Now the plate looked good but the meat in both was super salty!    Had it not been for the rice and beans and sour cream it would have been unedible.  Portions were a healthy size and rice and beans delicious but the service lousy.   Maybe it was too late in Sunday to visit. Idk but I'll pass next time."}

Enter Espo's in Chandler.  I was told that it had recently been remodeled but it looks and feels like it's been like this since the 50's - Spartan, cement floors, standard tables and chairs.  Exactly how it should be.  The staff are 4 Latin women speaking Spanish and very friendly and happy.  No attitude.  

Food - I ordered the green chile beef burrito and the beef floutas.   Unlike Same in either Mexico City or Santa Fe.   The burrito was excellent - soft tortilla wrapping a mushy mix of refried beans, shredded beef and subtle hints of green chile - simple but really effective (a+).  The floutas - over cooked hard shells, not enough inside and a little bland -rescued by surrounding lettuce, tomato, cheese and added red hot sauce (b-).  Add a dos Equis with a lime, with tip was 15 bucks.  

Quick service, overall A- food and appropriate surroundings and I highly recommend a stop in.  Set expectations correctly - this is not American Mexican - nor is it traditional Mexican cuisine (mole, al pastor, etc), nor is it high end regional cuisine (green chile from Romero farms NM on grilled elk).  It is basic SW USA Mexican, low cost but very good at what they do.  Enjoy!"}

After debating where to get some lunch, I talked my wife into making the 25 mile trip to Chandler to try Espos. Once getting there I was shocked how small the parking is, it literally hold like 5 cars. We parked across the street and made our way in. 

From the outside I didn't really know what to expect but once we walked in we were pleasantly surprised. It was very nicely cleaned and decorated. There isn't a ton of seating in there so I can see how it would get super busy and crowded in there. I wanted to try everything!!! I stuck to the the Green Chile and got the Chapo Burrito with beans and rice. My wife got the 3 tacos, and we got chips and salsa. They asked if it was our first time there and when we told them yes they gave us 2 free drinks. When we got our chow I was in heaven! The green Chile was delicious and has a small kick to it. It all bended together so well that I was in my own little world with El Chapo! The Beans and rice were a bit bland, I was happy that they weren't using uncle bens rice which is what most "Mexican restaurants" do. Adding salsa on it gave it some flavor. My wife's 3 tacos honestly were just ok, and im glad I didn't order that. I told her the reviews say "stick to green chile". I let her try my burrito and she loved it to. We even ordered another for dinner. If im ever in the area around lunch time ill def. come back to this spot. Friend service, great chow!!"}

I am the party planner for my team at work and someone suggested you guys as an option, remind me never to let that happen again!!! They are great for personal orders(maybe) but DON'T EVEEVVVEEERRRR go here for ordering more than 2 peoples food at a time on one ticket. I called in an order for about 15-20 people, everyone mostly got a burrito/rolled tacos so we didn't think it would be that bad... I told her everything the team ordered, including if they asked for no cheese on their stuff because we had about 4 people that could not eat it(allergy's and lactose) . First of all, after it was all said and done, the order was NOT repeated to me so I think that was the first mistake. When i went to pick up the food, it was so busy the lines were out the door so i cut them some slack. I waited for about 15 or 20 minutes after the time they said it would be ready. I work about 8 miles away from ESPO's and I have to use my own car and gas to drive out there and back. When me and another coworker picked up the food and drove back, we realized about more than half the teams food was wrong. Of course, I got talked to and bombarded because of this issue, like i shouldn't be able to trust ESPO's with not messing MOST of the order up. One or two mistakes, okay I get it but this was too much!!!! I spoke to an employee who said they would be able to refund some of the tacos and burritos so I could use it for gas which was not very much as all. They remade the stuff they messed up and sent me on my way, it was my mistake not to check it again. When I got back and my coworkers told me the order was wrong again, I got so mad, I was on the verge of just grabbing all of the food and get a whole refund. Was this really worth the hassle? Only 2 people got the food out of the 4 that was missing, even the people who had their food right said the burrito was REALLY soggy.  I called in again and i really wasn't the nicest, the manager stated, " I would hate to ask you to come back again but I don't know what else I can do." I told him he either refund the whole order or remakes the whole thing for the next day. I spoke to my manager who said to decline the option of remaking the whole order again for the following day because he was afraid they would go as far as spitting in the food for as bad as the service was. Would you drive back a third time??? NO! He then said he didn't think it was fair at all since they refunded a small amount of the food and remade the food missed. At this point, 200$ for these meals was way over pricing everything i went through with this restaurant and how upset my employees were at me. It was such a bad experience, i shed a few tears and I can hold myself together pretty well so it says a lot! The manager's name was BETO, please take my word for it, DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS ITS JUST YOU!!! :( I really wish they would have just remade the whole order, their food is good when they take their time. I lived across from this restaurant for 8 years, almost my whole childhood until my mother moved 4 years ago. It was good then, WHAT HAPPENED, GUYS!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!? We could have been ESPO's favorite/best paying customers....now another company gets our money. I am a such an idiot for tipping you guys 10$, If i could i would come get it all back. The worst part about this was that my food was right but when i got back, it was so cold that i ended up having to throw it away. i benefited NOTHING from this besides 4 hours off of the phone WHERE I ACTUALLY MAKE MY MONEY!!!  Thanks ESPO's for costing me more money than I paid for!!!!! Horrible experience."}

The machaca is fantastic.  So tender and full of lightly spiced flavors.  Based on other trusted reviews, I got it in a burrito enchilada-style, Christmas sauce and really enjoyed that.  I would get that again anytime.  

Then I got just a ground beef hard shell taco because I love the crunchy tacos and this one was simple and perfect.  The shell held up well, and was stuffed full of nicely seasoned meat and cheese, lettuce, & tomatoes.  For those 2 items it was $10.36 after tax.  (It's a buck fifty to make it Christmas)  Someone was a little slow greeting me and taking my order at the counter, but it wasn't like they were goofing off back there.  I could tell they were busy making delicious food.  It would have been nice if the dude industriously filling the napkins would have said something, but hey, they have those napkins full before the lunch rush.  The gentleman who did take my order was friendly and funny.  I had a great lunch and will definitely be back."}

We ordered the nacho supreme. This item isn't on their main menu? However, when we made our way up to place our order: we asked if they had or could do nachos. The cashier says "Nacho Supreme", "Yes"!! 

Generally, their nachos come with ground beef & includes as a topping -black olive. Asked for Carne Asada & opted out of the black olives.

Waited about 15 minutes to receive our meal. It came in a round foil aluminum pan. Toppings: cheese, refried beans, fresh guacamole, canned jalapeños, & a huge dollop of sour cream. The chips were extremely thin; not great tasting & looked to be a bagged type- not fresh. The nachos itself even with all those layers were very bland.

They have one salsa that's mild and not to flavorful.

The outdoor patio had a nice appeal with plenty of cool water misters. Cute decor. The BAR is eye catching as you walk through the gate. 

A plus, they do sell beer! Offer two style juices that look to be made in house.

While we ate browsed through their photos & a few of the previous Yelp reviews. Seems this place had more options/ appeal a few years ago that have changed with their new concept after reopening. 

Dinning area is small  & location can be difficult to get in & out of as well."}

I can't wait for it to be a few degrees warmer and I plan on really enjoying it!  They have plenty of umbrellas and trees for shade during the day and nice lights and heaters for the evening.  

They have great tamales for Christmas.  We've gotten our Christmas Eve tamales here the last two years and they are delicious!  

This is a local business that I love to watch. They seem to be doing well and I wish them all the best in the years to come."}

The newly remodeled restaurant is clean and open yet authentic to the original building and design.

 The food is always amazing and has that homemade feel that makes you feel all warm inside. It is a bit expensive compared to comparable Mexican restaurants in the area but you get what you pay for. Healthy portions and fresh ingredients will keep you coming back.

 Also, they have red cream soda tap, which is rare to see and boy is it tasty.

Espos is by far the best representation of Arizona - Mexican Cuisin that I have ever had. I Have now eaten here three times and each time I am more impressed.  Of particular note is the green chili beef. This is the best I've ever had and I make an incredible green chile myself!

Ample parking, quaint, rustic exterior with outdoor seating and misters. Inside its rustic and fun (b&w photos of various Mexican scenes framed on grill grates) with only 10 tables. Lots of menu options with variations of the assorted meats like carne asada, carnitas, etc. My husband and I got the El Jefe burrito filled with steak, lots of cheese and green chiles. Very tasty! My daughter got the taco salad served in a ginormous fried flour tortillas bowl. Wow! She's a big eater and she couldn't finish it! Chips and salsa were only 2.75 for a literal bucket of house made chips! Delicious and reasonably priced (burrito was 5.95 and taco salad was 6.29). Very good, I would definitely come back.""}

As I mentioned this is a casual place, but they have a nice patio out front and the restaurant is actually super clean.  In-fact, it has the nicest bathroom of any casual eatery I have every been to.

On a side note, last time I visited Espos, I noticed they have applied for a liquor license; Yea, Margarita's!

Give them a try, you will love it!"}

I am sad to report their people screw up the take out orders frequently. I watch two people come back and complain their orders were not correct. This should have alerted me to check my order very close. I ordered an ElJefa burrito, and a side of green chili beef. They didn't give me the green chili beef I ordered, but instead gave me green chili enchilada sauce. There is a big difference between the two, but they look similar in a container. 

This was one of the big reasons I stopped going here 10 years ago. We always ordered takeout because their place is not that nice, but they always screwed up the orders. My ElJefa burrito was very good, but they screwed up my lunch for the next day, and this pisses me off again. Since I was standing by the counter waiting for my food, I overhead the person in charge of the kitchen complaining to the help about getting the orders right. Clearly they did not listen. I'll give them one my try, but if the screw up my order again I'm DONE."}

It would be a grand feast, a feast large enough to rival the most important of dignitaries, it was not to be missed. 

Travelling far, far away, to the foreign land of Chandler, I left the warmth of my hovel, with the young boy in tow and the fair maiden as our passenger. The 145 horse Toyota carriage made quick time of our travels as we escorted our passenger to her banquet. With two and a half rotations of the hour glass until her meal concluded, the boy and I were off to find a meal fit for a king.

I always travel with Lord Yelp's scroll of merriment and wonder, I wouldn't find myself beheaded without it. In truth, Lord Yelp's scroll of merriment and wonder is the quintessential catalogue for booths, stalls and eateries in every land, and on this night, it directed us to Espos, the most wondrous of food from the southern land of Mexico.

I am simply unable to agree more with the sentiment of Lord Yelp with regards to the Espos carnitas plate, simply put, it is the stuff in which the night's dreams are made of and the rice and beans were delectable as well. Should I find myself travelling in the land of Chandler in days ahead, I would not be opposed to again trading my coin for meal."}

The Tacos are packed with meat and they have a decent salsa bar sitting in a slightly awkward place but they do make sure to refill it quit frequently. But anyway back to the deals. 10 tacos for 10 dollars and 2 dollar beers. Great deals, amazing food and an awesome staff will make the wait worth it."}

The food was awesome. I got the veggie burrito (beans, rice, veggies, green sauce). Man, what flavor. Good tortilla. One of my favorite veggie burritos for sure. I also got french fries -- aren't french fries just better at Mexican and Seafood restaurants? Fries were great."}

The customer service was not good. The girl behind the counter was on the phone, hung up, and didn't acknowledge me for about 2 minutes while she input a phone order. When my meal came out she must have whispered my order number because my food was just sitting there, waiting for me. It was clean inside.

Bottom line: There are better Mexican food options within a five mile radius. Rositas's, Burrito Express, Elmers, Amado's, Cafe Rio, etc. Go a little further and try Los Taquitos or Burrito Company. I won't be back to Espo's."}

Minuses: location not ideal, very busy intersection. Lot of traffic a few feet from the patio. Very casual atmosphere. Nothing upscale here. All food served on  foil pans or disposable plates, not a fan of that for eating in."}

My only issue with this place is the staff is just taking orders .. cashiers are not friendly, they call your number and then leave the food on the counter and go back to the kitchen .. they left off the rice and beans from my bf food and I had to go back Inside to ask for it.. the girl went back got thw rice & beans and just handed them to me and went back to the kitchen ..

Yowza it's awesome! Okay, so we ventured out on a Tuesday, Taco Tuesday that is. They said they have been here for 50 years. 

There was a little bit of a wait to get to placing our order. But it was no big deal at all. They were moving quickly. Standing in line I knew it would be good. Lots of people in the restaurant and lots of to-go orders. Drinks came out quickly. I had enough time to hit the toppings bar, and have a couple sips of my drink and tada the food was ready. 

You will likely meet the owner also- they are constantly taking care of the front of the house, cleaning up, and talking to guests. Definitely feels like family here. We had the 10 for $10 tacos, quesadilla, chips & queso with jalapeño. You choose your meat-ground beef, chx, carne asada, machaca beef, and carnitas. You can mix can mix and match however you like. They have a toppings bar to choose your salsas, etc. Or you can order a side of something else for toppings; guac, cheese, and so on. As well as the $2 margaritas. I've had margaritas from just about everywhere and these were great. They tasted so fresh, not that heavy syrup-y sweet and sour like other places. We tried both peach and raspberry. So good! 

Initially, we sat inside and did not notice it being hot or needing a/c like another reviewer said. It was very comfortable. A table on the patio became available and we ended up eating on the patio. They had a DJ and music out there so the vibe was fun and relaxed. Just perfect. 

I would go here ANY day of the week with family, friends, co-workers or anyone for that matter!! Their regular prices are really good and I can't wait to try more items next time."}

Parking is relatively sparse but turnover is quick so you should be fine. Ended up ordering steak quesadillas, and chips and Queso. The steak quesadilla was HUGE and cooked really well. It was deliciously cheesy and I got mine with some jalapeños. It had a nice kick to it and wasn't overly oily with steak that was tender. The chips and Queso is normal usually for any Mexican restaurant but the Queso itself had a multitude of ingredients that made it have a great texture as well. Overall, if you're looking for something tasty, fast, and priced well try out Espos."}

A:  Gets jalapeño business!

Established in 1955 and loved ever since!  

Want a place that offers delicious food and a live DJ? Come to Espos! It's a small cozy eatery that offers both indoor and outdoor seating. I personally would recommend taking it to-go if you live in the area. Parking can be a little hectic but it just goes to show how big of a following they have.

Six words:  Machaca Enchiladas and Green Chile Plate. Their rice is super fluffy and tasty and the beans are done right. Toss on more cheese and their spicy green salsa and it's a meal that'll stick to your bones. Their red salsa is also done beautifully but the green salsa packs the heat. They make some wonderful plates that taste amazing. I still need to try their burritos but this is the place I go to for enchiladas.

So come to Espos for some good eats. Don't dilly dally and get your butt over there right now!"}

Sweet prices also, I always feel like I'm getting a good value!

Yes, it does get CRAZY BUSY on Tuesdays as their taco Tuesday deals on food AND drinks bring out people in droves. But it's worth it, and service is often quick enough for the long lines.

Espo's is a legit gem for Mexican in Chandler and I can't stop taco'ing (sorry) about it !"}

One of the best Green Chile burritos I've had. 

I tried Espos for the first time today. I work about 10 mins. away. I thought let me grab quick grub and head back to my office. I will be silly to think I can do that again. 

Espos definitely deserves the long business lines because the food is just darn good! I went at about 5:30p, seen the small parking lot was full (additional parking in the dirt behind the concrete parking lot). Walked in and was greeted by a line of hungry people who know good grub. The cashier was very fast! So I got threw the line in about 5 mins (where the heck do you get that!?). Soon enough, my number was called after about a 10 min. wait. 

I wouldn't say this is the best place for brining a large group. The place is cozy size - but it's a new favorite spot for food to-go."}

Now I regret that.  The atmosphere is very casual and the staff is friendly.  It's a good sign when you see older Mexican ladies cooking in the back and patrons of Hispanic descent (ooh, that was really, really p.c.) at tables all around you.  The portions are sizable and the food tastes authentic.  The tortillas are excellent, large, thin, soft, warm.  Only tortillas that compare are Carolina's.  There were a couple food items that looked a bit different, maybe strange, but they were delicious.  The carne asada was like nothing I'd seen.  It looks like ground beef or some kind of soilant-green meat product,...sorry, sounds gross,....but it was really good and tasty.  I had low hopes for the guacamole when it came out and looked very smooth and maybe from a package.  But, I was wrong, it was excellent!  Beans looked a bit runny, but very flavorful and delicious!  Rice, excellent!!  Chicken asada, very soft and flavorful. The pico was super fresh and chilled,....salsa was fantastic and spicy.

Overall, I thought this was one of the best tasting Mexican Restaurants I have been to in quite a while and I already look forward to returning.  I'd definitely recommend it for out-of-towners looking for authentic Mexican cuisine, family fun, relaxing dinners or a night out with friends."}

It's got a decently sized outdoor seating area and a smaller indoor seating area. The inside was a bit disorganized- there was no formal "order place" it seemed, since nobody was standing at the cash register. A woman kept running back and forth, setting orders on trays and calling out numbers. People would come and grab their trays, meanwhile a few customers had gathered in the same area and were confused as to where we should stand to indicate we wanted to order.

There was only one large menu on the wall, no handheld menus to read, so that was a bit difficult without my glasses.

Either way, we did get to order and took a seat at a table to wait for our number to be called. At first it seemed a tad pricy, but we hadn't seen the food yet. We sipped on our aguas frescas while we waited. They were delicious! They had watermelon and peach. Both were amazingly good. One free refill allowed for those.

We got our food in no more than 10 minutes. My chimichanga was HUGE so I was glad I didn't add rice and beans. There wasn't a ton of flavor but it worked for me because it was perfectly crispy and had plenty of sour cream, shredded cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Some kind of special sauce on top would've been nice, though.

The burritos were rather large, too. My friend said the steak inside was pretty good and they are not skimpy at all with the meats, so it was definitely a good value. The rice and beans were also very good and clearly homemade.

We would totally be back if we come to the area! Hopefully the ordering and front counter area gets a bit more organized, though."}

Ordered carne assada tacos plain and a carne assada chimi.  The carne assada (in the tacos and chimi) has the texture of a meat product but not much flavor.  So the tacos weren't bad but they were bland (even plain tacos should have some sort of flavor).  As for the chimi since it came with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and guacamole, it tasted like those things.

Overall, a pretty big meh.  That being said, I'll probably go back if for no other reason than old times sake.  

I gave them a 3 (agian, old times sake) but in reality it's closer to a 2."}

We were looking for a new Indian place to serve yummy food for our guests (expecting about 100-120 people). Our experience today was awful!!!! The food was terrible. The chicken tandoori was raw, the chicken dum biryani( it is not even called a biryani), curries had no flavor, the desserts were not good( the fruits in the mango custard were not fresh, the carrot halwa( I don't want to call it a Halwa. Very bad!!!)). It's good that we have tried the food before ordering for our party. We have ordered at "Kabab palace", "Pastries N chaat" and "Chennai Fusion Grill" for our previous parties and the food was never a fail. We love those places. This time we just thought we will try something new but we absolutely regret going to this place. We will never recommend this place to anyone( friends, family and colleagues).

I will have to go back to see if it was a one day thing, but the reason I decided to round down and give 3 stars only was because the meat dishes (especially the tikka masala) was almost without meat for the entire time we were there. I realize that it is a popular dish, but to not have it restocked was disappointing. Also, since there were so many people, the naan was only given in small amounts."}

I can tell this place has a strong grasp on spice use and levels and are masterful at bringing it right to the edge for buffet food that everyone can eat it and everyone will be pleased.

They fill your water as soon as you walk in and give you the option of plain or garlic naan.  I opted for garlic.  It's not as crispy as I'm used to, but it's still really good, and I think most people prefer the way it's prepared here vs. the crackery crispy type that I've had elsewhere.  This is strictly personal preference.

I spoke with the owner during my meal and he was very friendly and gave me a history of the restaurant, how long they've been open and their philosophy that "everything we serve here is what we eat at home".  It shows in their food for sure.  It's cool to have the actual owner tell you that his father is cooking for you the same thing he cooks at home for his own family.

The lunch buffet price is very reasonable.  Definitely go for the buffet to get a wide variety of everything.  They have a large selection, a nice salad section as well as several sauces which is very rare for an Indian buffet.  It's nice to have those sauces available.

My only one gripe.  My lady was unable to go with me on that day, so I promised to bring her home a dish.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala to go.  The owner asked me if I just want some from the buffet or they can make it scratch.  I opted to go with from scratch and asked for mild, since my girl doesn't need her food to be hot for her to enjoy it.  When he brought it out, it was a medium sized cup container of the entree, but there was no side of rice or naan bread.  Just the dish.  I don't know if he just kind of misunderstood what I was asking for, but I was charged more for the little cup of food than i was for the three plates (yes i had three don't make fun) of food I had at the buffet.  Maybe the owner can comment and I will switch to 5 stars if maybe I was confusing the way I ordered to go.  If not, I think this place would be perfect if they were to include a cup of rice and maybe a naan bread to make it worth the price.

The restaurant is clean and they opt to play Indian music with a contemporary twist, so you get a little something for everyone.  They keep the buffet very clean, they are attentive and fill your water constantly, which is good because this food can be spicy."}

Where do I begin? The decor is simple but very clean and as soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. We encountered three waiters and every single one was super nice and they all answered any questions we had.

This was my first time eating Indian food and I am a fan. My husband had the chicken masala spice level 7 and I had a shrimp dish (I can't remember the exact name) spice level 5. We each ordered a side of basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was absolutley delicious and not too spicy. We ended the meal with the deep fried cheese dessert which was amazing. 

When you come across a place like this you want to tell everyone! There is a shortage of places to eat where not only is the service excellent, but the food is as well. They don't get all of these amazing ratings for nothing, so go check them out! I can't wait to go back!"}

The pickled lemons and peppers were not only available, but were some of the best pickles I've ever had.  Just the right amount of saltiness.

The karahi paneer's consistency seemed a bit off.  The paneer was good, but semi-raw red peppers just threw the whole thing off.

I didn't really like the lamb achari either.  Usually I can tease out the different flavors.  This achari just seemed to have one flavor and it wasn't that great.

The space is typically sparse.  The service was very good."}

One thing I love about Indian food is that it is even better the next day. My Matter Paneer was good at the restaurant, but somehow when it's a day old and has been nuked, then it's fantastic!

Only downside to this restaurant was the service. Note to Manager: When a customer has been given their food, someone should come over and check that it is good BEFORE the customer has finished eating. I would have raved to the server about the food, but didn't get a chance. It's not like the place was busy - we were the only customers there.

But the food was great so we will be going back. I'd love to try the buffet, but then I won't get my "day-old" nuked food the next day! Decisions, decisions! :0)

The Shrimp vindaloo had no vindaloo flavoring, again dish/recipe failed. Now the pricing, the prices were high for the amount of food provided in each dish.

Unlike other Indian restaurants I've visited, New India Gate allows you to control the heat level on EVERY dish. This is wonderful, because I can't handle the heat and haven't been able to try dishes I wished I could! The most amazing part is my 5yo ordered goat, and LOVED IT! He hates every food his parents suggest, so I'm still amazed. He told us "this place got five stars, but it should've gotten SIX!"

Wow, I was so surprised on many levels today when I accidentally came across an Indian place while doing errands.  We have been to hundreds over the years in many countries but not able to find too many in Arizona!  
Ordered to go:
Meat samosa - (accidentally gave us beef instead of chicken but it was better than most and have a great flavor on the outside which was a surprise)
Tandoori wings - tender and so flavorful, better than most we have tried anywhere including the "wing" place!
Mater paneer - (peas and cheese) mild, and it really was mild because I can't do spicy which eliminates a lot of places for me.
Chicken tikka masala  (mild again I can't do spicy and it was) ... wow, tender chicken breast and flavored.  Yup, one of the best butter sauces I have ever tasted.  And I love that is was not loaded with veggies because I like to dip my naan in it!
Basmati rice - perfectly cooked and tender.
Regular naan - (I prefer a little chewy and bendable to pick up food) and it was awesome.
So happy I tried this.
Service by the way was amazing.  Can't wait to do this again!!!!!"}

There is a reason for this...the food is simply fantastic!  I typically have the buffet during lunch time.

The ownership and staff take great pride in presenting a good product in a warm inviting atmosphere...always being quite friendly with the guests.  Like I said earlier, the food is fantastic!  It is by far the best location to find delicious Indian cuisine in all of Metro Phoenix!  Be sure to stop by for an excellent meal!  You will not be disappointed!"}

I'm so glad I did!

I ordered togo chicken tikka masala and an order of garlic naan-bread (no rice, still doing no or low carb!) As far as spice goes they have a variety of them, but this time I opted for Indian medium (I really thought my head was going to explode because I wanted something between medium and hot, but either I'm getting used to it, it's 108°F outside, or I'm not certain it was just that hot!)

The chicken tikka masala was fantastic, so much so I could have drank the gravy it's in! The garlic non-was a little less impressive but sure did make it fun soaking up the gravy I didn't drink (see attached picture).

I'm not certain when I'll be in the greater Chandler area again, but if I am and I'm in the mood this will definitely be my Indian goto spot. You've got to like a place that's only five months old but the love and care they show really comes through in the cleanliness of the restaurant as well as the food.

Here's the rundown:

Satisfied? Yes

Return? Yes

Advocate? Yes"}

Yum. Ordered take out here during lunch. Young man answering the phone (owner?) was really polite and helpful.
Came to pickup the order and found a large, clean, busy restaurant. All of the employees were super nice.
I did have a bit of a long wait for the order but people kept checking on me and I didn't really mind waiting.
The food was really tasty! You can specify the spice level, which I appreciated. I had medium spice, which was just right for someone who is kind of a spice wimp but still wants a little kick.
The naan was delicious, as was the saag paneer. 
Will definitely be back for the customer service, cleanliness, and delicious food! Might just dine in next time with the takeout wait time though ..."}

I was very disappointed to say the least. 
Limited options. Pakoras were oily but not crispy. All the curries were bland. Chicken teeka was like chicken pieces in red cream. Only thing spicy on the buffet was chicken biryani. Taste wise it was ok, but had an over cooked texture. The rice grains were smashed or broken with the chicken. For anyone who likes like spicy AUTHENTIC Indian food, this place is NOT for him/her. 
I would rate the food (entrees and appetizers) 2 star. That extra star is for service( which was great), garlic naan and gajar halwa. And yeah also for the price point."}

Sorry but I had to drop my 5 stars to 3 tonight, only due to my most recent order pick up experience.  I ordered a tandoori chicken, two breads, and qeema/beef samosa.  The tandoori chicken was almost raw/uncooked from the inside and the beef inside samosas was just nasty in simple terms.  It looked very raw as well.  I have no idea what happened here but the food tonight was very bad, which is unusual for this place.  

Tandoori chicken was not charcoaled whatsoever, it appeared to be boiled chicken dumped into some kind of a sauce.  I've had tandoori chicken at many Indian places but nothing like this, sorry I have to disagree with the manager.  Your tandoori chicken is NOT tandoori!"}

As a novice to Indian Food, I was a bit apprehensive that the buffet might be too spicy for my taste. I expressed my concerns to the waitress, and the manager (possibly the owner) ended up walking us through the entire buffet, dish-by-dish, explaining the ingredients in each dish, what to expect from a heat perspective and how to adjust the heat on-the-fly if it is too spicy. I'm not sure I've ever had a restaurant provide such a careful, detailed explanation of their food, and I was thoroughly impressed with their friendliness and desire to make sure I felt confident in making selections.

In terms of the quality of the food, I can't say I'm an expert at evaluating Indian food, but everything tasted really fresh and high quality, and they had a solid selection of vegetarian dishes on the buffet as well. I am a meat-eater, but the vegetarian curry was actually my favorite dish! Plus, if you go on the weekend they have an amazing mango pudding on the buffet (served Saturday and Sunday only)!

I'll absolutely dine at New India Gate again in the future!"}

1 star:  Never again.

3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This place deserves its 5 stars.  Perhaps the friendliest service of the many Indian joints in the Valley.  After a few years hiatus, they're back, and I'm very glad that they are.  

I've been to approximately 10 different Indian lunch buffets in the Valley and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, on the whole, this is the best.  From variety to quality, it hits all the right notes.  The friendly staff adds that much more to the experience.  

I don't mind places that have bone-in chicken in their curries, but bonus points to this place for using boneless.  Their chicken tikka masala is excellent, as is their garlic naan.  I'm a sucker for kheer and their's is particularly good.  There's a great mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, complimentary chai masala also helps.

Until I find something better, this is my go-to Indian in the Valley."}

They seat, take orders, bus tables, serve the food and answer every question about the eclectic menu that is thrown at them. The recipes, however, are the fathers. 

We decided to sample menu items other than the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala. We started of with the beef samosas. I had never seen the beef variety before.  All I can say is "WOW!"  Served with mint and tamarin chutney, the     delicately spiced ground beef was seasoned perfectly.  I would have  been satisfied to end the meal right then and there.   

Next was the Fish Pakora, they were tasty and made with moist white fish.  Nothing mind blowing.  For the main meals we ordered "Indian Hot" spice level. 

We ordered: Mushroom Matter (mushroom, tomato, green peas and spices),  Chana Masala (garbanzo beans and masala sauce), and Karahi Shrimp (ginger, tomoto, onion, bell pepper served in an Indian copper pan). I was craving super hot but I would equate it to a medium at a Thai restaurant.  The food paired really well with the fresh soft garlic naan.  I am definitely returning and bringing friends!"}

My very first visit here and I left stuffed! The restaurant is very clean and open. We tried the Buffett and everything was so delicious. 

The service was great as well, they made sure to come around and fill your water and fill up the bread. 

They actually comped a Mango Lassi drink and it was soooo good that we actually purchased a second one. If you like mangos, you have to try this drink. 

Overall, my visit was excellent, I'm looking forward to going back soon."}

After looking at reviews on yelp, I found this restaurant and called in an order on my way home. I ordered the chicken tikka masala (medium spice), basmati rice, and plain naan. It was delightful! I always over estimate the amount of spice I like in my Indian food, so I may order the spice level lower next time, but that's on me. The amount of food you get for the price is good, even without the 20% discount right now. I am new to the area, and from what I understand the owners had a restaurant before and have recently moved to this location on Ray, but you can tell they have been in the business quite a while from their warm welcome when I arrived to their flawless execution of my dish and the dishes I saw when there. I'll definitely be back!"}

The buffet was hot and well stocked, with a dozen main dishes, plus salads and sweets. 

My wife had paneer tika masala (very tasty), saag planner (really good, flavorful and spicy), and daal maharani (very good). I had the chicken curry (nicely spicy with big pieces of chicken), tandoori chicken (perfectly cooked, moist, and yummy), and chicken dum biryani (medium spicy and very tasty). 

We talked with both father and son, co-owners, that opened this spot just three weeks ago. They are very friendly and attentive to the guests, even when it is just the buffet."}

After multiple trips to New India Gate, they have officially taken the crown away from Delhi Palace as my all-time favorite!

The buffet is fully packed with tasty offerings which, once the craving hits, has me coming back just about every couple of weeks.  At $9.95 for the weekend buffet, I truly feel that for the quality and quantity of food that they offer, you get more than your moneys worth.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is absolutely scrumptious every single time that I visit this establishment, along with the Tandori Chicken, tender and juicy with just the right amount of spice to it, the Vegetable Samosas, a crispy, flaky pastry filled with spiced up potatoes and veggies, and their rice as the base, which is cooked to perfection every time I visit.  The garlic naan has just the right amount texture and flavor to sop up alll of those incredible sauces on your plate to create the perfect bite.  These are just a few of the many delicious choices that keep me coming back for more!

Lastly, the dessert selection is the perfect finishing acts to send your taste buds into the stratosphere.  The Kheer is without a doubt, the best version of rice pudding that I've ever had.  That along with the Golab Jaman, little balls of milky goodness, various spices and sugar syrup just add to the symphony of flavors that this fine place offers.  Finally, the Gajar Halwa, their take on a sweet carrot dessert, which includes nuts and raisins, is just another home run that makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

Bottom line - if you've never gone outside the box and experimented with this type of food, the buffet at New India Gate is the perfect place to give your taste buds something new that they'll thank you for later.  If you've already tried out Indian food and are a fan of this type of cuisine, come to this place and see what all of the terrific reviews are about!  The family which owns the place truly show their love for the food that they're putting out for the masses and are extremely generous and personable.  Keep up the high standard that you've already set New India Gate, it's certainly working on yours truly!"}

I'm pretty sure that the rice was reheated leftovers (it was dry and kind of clumpy), and the raita is the simply the worst I've ever had. It was like a bowl of milky water with weird lumps in it. I overheard one of the young gentlemen owners tell another table that the problem was a lack of access to reliably good milk. That is the biggest bunch of baloney. Hahaha! Look, if you can't make a decent yogurt from scratch for your raita, buy yogurt. Given the choice between having to tell customers "Sorry, we don't have raita tonight" versus serving that mess, go with the former, please.
Now, on the upside, the rest of our meal was good, and the kitchen got our food out quickly. All in all, just based on one visit, I'd say that the "New" India Gate is a fine place to satisfy your Indian food cravings, but it's nowhere near my first choice."}

The palak paneer tasted almost exactly like a green enchilada sauce with a distinct flavor of Mexican chilies and corn flour. It's very weird to look at palak, knowing it to be clearly Indian, and then experiencing an entirely different country when you put it in your mouth.

The aloo gobi also lacked depth and tasted very Americanized. The other dishes on the buffet were average.

The hub and I really like Indian food, but often find places disappointing-too rich, lacking complex flavors, or simply not fresh. What a treat to find this place on Yelp - it was as good as one would expect from the reviews (even leftovers heated the next day). The dal is far more flavorful than in many places, using a few different legumes and interesting spices-not full of heavy cream, more a rich gravy consistency. The Bengan Bharta had the wonderful smoky quality of eggplant roasted first in a tandoor, then sautéed with some other tasty veg and spices; yum! The garlic naan was perfectly cooked, as was the less common gobhi (cauliflower) paratha. Vegetable samosas were flaky, with excellent filling and fresh chutneys on the side. Even desserts were delicious and cooked in house. Service by two friendly and welcoming brothers (owners) couldn't be better. The whole experience is like being invited in for a home-cooked meal. We can't wait to return!"}

Not something you see very often but it was much needed rain. We were greeted by a friendly male who kindly stated we could sit where we liked. I have had my fair share of Indian food and of course some better than others but we know kinda what we wanted so it didn't take us long to view the menu and decide what we wanted to eat. We ordered a beef samosa for appetizer, chicken tikka masala and goat curry. Everything was so full of flavor, tender and the meat just melted in your mouth. The service was INCREDIBLE. All the staff members were so helpful and very attentive to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied. I will definitely be coming back for dinner and may even try their lunch buffet one day. Even if you don't like Indian just come here to enjoy the atmosphere of these impressively kind business people. We need more people and businesses that you can see care about the quality of their food and the service they provide. Great food, great service, and great environment equals happy customers.

I just got off work and chicken vindaloo was calling my name. I read the Yelp reviews on here and decided this is totally happening. I met the brothers who own this wonderful place and they were so friendly and helpful. The place is clean and spacious, to make room for the many people who will be excited to eat here as I was.  

Chicken vindaloo- Yes, it's banging! I ordered it Indian spicy because I appreciate the heat. This was the freshest homemade chicken vindaloo I've ever had, and I frequently order this at any Indian restaurant I try. 

Lunch: What a great variety and selection in their buffet! Everything I ate in the buffet was flavor heaven! I'm going to dream about their tiki masala until I can have it again. Curry chicken was delicious, mushroom matter was saucy, perfect over rice. They have pickled lemons!  It's another favorite of mine that not many Indian restaurants have out here and I enjoy it. I can already tell I'm going to live at this place. You'll easily become a regular here because everything about this place is full of joy. 

I was told these were mom's recipes and man do they have a great mom! Their mom gave them a lifetime of good food! Holy cow.  I'm going to try everything on their menu. You definitely need to come here or you're missing out."}

Chicken Curry
Chicken Tikka Masala
Kafta

Also on their buffet last time they had these 2 amazing deserts.  An Indian 'fudge' that reminded me of homemade Scottish shortbread and deep fried flour bits tossed in syrup.
Both soon good and excellent ways to end a meal there."}

That being said, I was really impressed with the food at New India Gate. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere when we walked in and we were greeted right away. We actually had several servers through the evening and my favorite was a well-dressed younger man who was very attentive (might have been a manager or owner?)  I ordered chicken tikka masala and some samosas. We got a little appetizer of a crispy cracker-like think with some sauces that was really tasty (sorry, don't know what it's called--told you I was new!) and then the samosas came out. We did some veggie and some meat and they were great--the veggie, in particular. However, we did have to wait quite a bit for our main dish to come out. The guy did stop by to apologize for the wait and I saw him and the others doing their best to get food out as soon as it was ready. It was worth the wait because it was all very good. I got mine mild and it was just right for me. Also enjoyed the garlic naan but I would suggest they add jasmine rice to the menu instead of or in addition to the standard white rice. They were offering a yelp deal for new customers which we took advantage of and the ticket was really quite reasonable. I'd absolutely go back and would recommend over the other ones that I've tried in Tempe."}

First off, it was clean and the people were super nice and inviting. We were seated immediately. It was around noon on a Tuesday, but there were only a couple of other people in the restaurant, which was a little odd.

The buffet had a great variety of typical Indian favorites, and a few not as well known dishes. The rice was well cooked, fragrant, and hot. The only real downfall is that the food lacked a bit of spice. I know that's typical with buffets because they want to tone it down a notch for the average person, but I feel like it was toned down too much. Even so, I really enjoyed it and will definitely be back!"}

I felt the palak paneer was watery like a soup with no flavor.  The malai kofta was burned on the inside of the kofta balls and the rest of the curry had a burned flavor as a result. The naan was thin and chewy instead of being thick and soft. They charge for rice which I personally feel is a rip off. The only thing they had that was okay in our opinion was the chicken tikka masala and even that was lacking. In my opinion, the reason this place gets high ratings is the service and ambience is really nice especially when compared to other Indian restaurants in the local area. But the food itself did not impress and I would recommend driving to Phoenix or Scottsdale for real Indian food in my opinion."}

After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to trying a selection of dishes.  The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated - it wasn't busy, but I was there early.  When I arrived, my to go order wasn't quite ready and they invited me to have some water and to try some of the snacks at the buffet bar.  I can't remember the name, but one was like the papadam bread I have had in other indian restaurants, but I think they are called something else here.  Also the little dessert doughnut type balls in syrup - so good!  I really appreciated that they made me feel welcome - that counts for so much!

We ordered the tandoori chicken, the chicken makhni, aloo gobhi and the bengan bharta along with some naan breads.  Everything was great! We ordered it "medium" spicy and while the bengan bharta was pretty spicy the others came out pretty mild - will kick it up next time.  Portions were good sized - definitely enough for dinner plus a couple meals afterwards.  

My only complaint: I did wish we got some raita, green sauce and chutney as side condiments though.  I am used to getting small portions of those along with your to go order without having to ask or pay extra."}

The chicken was perfectly marinaded and cooked - great hint of lemon from the marinating process and the marinade was tasty and not overbearing.

An absolute "MUST GO" kind of  establishment. I am picky, no doubt. I do not hand out reviews and compliments unless one is well deserved, good or bad. 

So, here we go!

The immediate engagement by the owners was perfect. They had and have no issue with sharing what is in, and how their food is prepared. I love the fact that they procure their poultry and (fresh) vegetables from local farms here in Arizona. My girlfriend is celiac and has to have a strict gluten free diet. We continually search for restaurants that are GF friendly. This is home.
On our first visit, I was so impressed with how patient and honest they were.
I mean, we must have talked for about 30 minutes (before we ordered), as to what is safe and what to avoid and how they handle the food, and so on...every detail explained.

The table linens are fresh and clean. No stains! Glasses, spotless! The silverware, no doubt, clean. Presentation of the tables have a classy charm, too. Whether you are single or on a date, married, or have a big family, New India Gate makes you feel welcomed and important. If you get the opportunity to meet Manuel, you will feel like he is their speciffically only, for you. He is a true gentlemen and very attentive. He will remember your name and say hello to you everytime. His service is excellent!

The food, simply stated; INCREDIBLE!!!
I have my favorites....I won't share them. You will have to discover yours, on your own.

New India Gate is one of Chandlers most prized treasures in the city. You will not be dissapointed. 

Hope this review makes you want to dine there....I am so glad we found this place. Enjoy and bon appetit!"}

Went with Lamb Vindaloo, at waiter's advise. Normally I prefer seafood, but he was not wrong about the lamb... the lamb was soooooo tender and delicious, despite the hellishly spicy Indian-hot spice level I ordered. That was my doing though, and honestly I regret nothing because it was so delicious. Thanks for a great experience. I have to run the rounds and check out some other Indian places but you are number one on the list right now. 

Was there supposed to be potatoes & tomatoes & chili peppers in the stew? Because it was only meat chunks, but the sauce was so thick I can't help but wonder if they are pureed into the sauce. I am very new to Indian cuisine, and again, I have no complaints, because it was sooo yummy. 

Also, boyfriend brings home chicken tikka masala leftovers on a weekly basis, and even leftovers of that shit is dope. This is why I picked this place to try! Passed on lunch buffet (seems like a great deal) as they didn't have what I wanted to try. 

Wish the rice were seasoned, only main complaint. And then every other reviewer chats up the garlic naan but it just tasted like American-ass pizza/garlic bread, just thinner. I was disappointed because that's what I wanted but turned out they had even tastier things to offer. Also was kinda bummed about the paneer pakora. It was so good, but basically cheesesticks with the added bonus of spinach. Once it was cool enough to eat, the cheese had solidfied (and i order cheese things because melty cheese is so amazing haha)  You have your pick of sweet & sour or mint for dipping, and the mint/herb sauce on the side is divine!"}

We had the lunch buffet which was, first off, super cheap!

Now for the food- the food was good. It was not the best Indian food I've had in Phoenix for sure. Even among buffets it is not the best. They gave us a choice of garlic or regular naan. We went for the garlic naan and it was awesome. I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken and this beef and pea thing (I have absolutely no idea what it was called). Other things that I typically enjoy and are standard for Indian buffets-- butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer were all average. If there dinner food tasted like that, I probably wouldn't order anything listed above. The dessert here was also pretty good but standard. They had rice kheer and Gulab jamun. 

The food was a solid three stars and honestly good for $7.99. I hope they work on improving the depth of flavor that is usually found in Indian food. 

The restaurant itself also gets 3 stars. It was super clean which is awesome, but on the day we were there their AC must have been broken or really high- definitely not something you want in an AZ summer.

Aside from price, the reason this place gets 4 stars and not 3 is that the service is stellar. Our waiter was awesome and genuinely cared about our meal. The manager (I think) also came by and you could tell that he genuinely cared about the restaurant. I definitely see a lot of potential for this restaurant!"}

I intentionally came here when I was two days overdue with a baby to try and see if a hot curry would send me into labor. 
The helpful waiter suggested I order the entrees "hot" and my husband and I followed suit.  We ended up with the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka both hot.  
And they were HOT.  And I love spicy.  But holy moly my eyes were watering.  
Still I persevered. 

And guess what?  6 hours later I was in full blown labor.  So thank you India Gate for saving me from having to be induced!"}

My husband and I went last night on our date night. The restaurant is clean and modern looking. We were greeted by one of the owners (it's owned by 2 brothers). 
The brothers were so personable and fun. They make you feel like you're an old friend and were always available for drink refills or for extra mint chutney! 
We ordered a variety of food. We started with the vegetable snack plate that had a variety of deep fried yummy snacks. Very good and nicely seasoned.
The goat curry is delicious. The goat meat is so tender and the sauce is yummy. We ordered the basmati rice which was light and fluffy. The shrimp korma.... I will sing the praises of this dish! The shrimp were fork tender and the gravy is the ultimate comfort food! Order the garlic naan so you can soak up all the goodness with it! 
We were given a sample of the sweet mango lassi. It was thick and creamy. I could have downed a gallon of the stuff easy! 
We opted for some dessert to round out our meal. We ordered the gulab jamun and the pistachio kulfi. The gulab jamun was good. A little more dense than I like. But the kulfi.... wow! It was so delicious! You HAVE to try it!
We will definitely be back to try more of their food!"}

The buffet is only $7.99 during the week, and it includes Garlic Naan, and Chai Tea. The buffet is not large: maybe 8-10 dishes, but they are all extremely well made, really delicious and many had a nice heat.

I had the Samosas the beef ones THE BEST IVE EVER HAD!!!
Gopi the manager/server was attentive friendly and over all made my visit like I was eating at his house.  I ordered the chicken Tika Masala 5 stars I ordered it Indian hot it was divine.  The basmati rice was flaky and delicious.  The only odd thing is they charge for the rice ?  Never seen that before. The buttered Naan was made to perfection. Over all I wish I lived here I would be going all the time. Hopefully they will have a family member open up this restaurant in Texas!!!! Great job New IndianGate your a hidden gem !!!

Tikka masala, chicken curry, curry pakora were all very good. Naan was hot and fresh and tasted sooo good, your choice of garlic or plain. They don't skimp on the naan either. You got 4 large pieces at a time. Others only give you a piece or two at a time. I was able to try both and actually liked the plain better. Servers were very friendly and took my plate as soon as I was finished and kept my glass full. I guess a family owns it, mother, father and two sons. The dad is legit with a turban and a huge smile ready to get you what you need. For desert I had some of the best rice pudding I have ever had at an Indian buffet, and you can never go wrong with the gulab jaman. All you can eat for less than 10 bucks! I'll be back soon!"}

I'm not one to turn down an invite for an Indian lunch buffet. Finding out that this little gem is close by, we're on our way. Totally nondescript surroundings outside and in. But that warm n fuzzy feeling of truly being welcomed hit before the front door shut behind us. I could do without the constant reminder of "front door open" with every entry/exit. We unfortunately chose the table right by that annoying little speaker.  I've got a tool that can quickly put an end to that.
It's spotless clean & didn't smell like feet, as curry can sneak up on you like that. The tables are dressed with nice linens.
The few selections were typical and our choice of nan was given and brought warm & fresh quickly. We tried everything and it was all mmmmm tasty. A little mango chutney would've been good but I managed to inhale 2.5 plates. 
But these guys running this place are genuinely friendly, helpful and deserving of a fat tip. 
All in all, in my top 5 restaurants when I want to get my Indian fix"}

I had a wonderful dinner and got to try something new.  I really wanted the lamb ashoka, that's lamb cooked in the juice from Indian pickle.  Our waiter brought out a little dish of the sauce for me to try, and it was delicious.  It would have killed me, though.  My stomach just won't put up with that kind of thing any more.  I'd never seen this dish any place else and so I learned something new, which is cool.  I ended up going with my standby mattar paneer, which was excellent.  As usual, I ate too much.  There's always room for kheer as far as I'm concerned.  The kheer was also wonderful.  Try this place if you're needing a fix of Indian food.  I can't wait for the next visit.  And I definitely have try the lunch buffet!

Plus, the service from the owners of this place (especially the young man) is just excellent. Their combination of amazing food at a great price and their attention to detail will make this business prosperous. 

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley of the Sun! 

P.S.- The review is for buffet lunch only. I haven't been to New India Gate during dinner hours."}

The menu includes relatively traditional Indian fare with a few items that were not as familiar to me.  Every dish I tried was packed with flavor and the service was excellent.  It's a family run business with two very kind brothers taking care of the front of the house and their parents back in the kitchen cooking great food.  We were told that their meat is locally sourced and that they use some non traditional ingredients like olive oil to help keep things on the healthy side.  Their vindaloo and korma were great.  One of my friends ordered a goat dish and loved it but I didn't get a taste.  Desserts were home made and excellent as well.  Be sure to get the home made pistachio ice cream!"}

It is quite difficult to find a good Indian place for lunch. Especially when you want to eat an all you can eat buffet. 
New India Gate is the perfect place to do so! Nested in a shopping mall, the outside of the building is not very welcoming. However as soon as you step foot into the restaurant, the staff greets you and shows you to your table. Our waiter was very polite and very friendly, we were asked if we wanted plain or garlic bread. Of course we took the garlic one! 
There is no menu at the table since it's a lunch buffet, we waited to get our sodas then we decided to jump in! There is a wide variety of choices from a spinach dish (one of my favorite by the way) to tandoori chicken. Even if you are vegetarian, you will find something delicious to eat. 
Every employee that came to our table were very nice, we weren't rushed to finish our plates or anything.
You actually have to go to the counter/bar to pay, which is totally fine. The lunch buffet is $7.99, seriously! 
If we ever crave for Indian food for lunch, I know where I'm going!"}

Weekend buffet exceeded my expectations! Our "go to" spot has been cutting back on quality for some time now and I thought it was time to try some place new. So glad I did.
Star of the buffet was the paneer tikka masala. Many layers of spices, butter/ghee, and tomato goodness. The owner's son (I believe) frequently checked on us, refilling our drinks and asking how we liked it. I gushed over the tikka and he told me everything is homemade there, even the sauces they offer - Chutneys. 
You can tell! The paneer cheese had a satisfying chew and creaminess. How is this found on a buffet?? I was impressed. Not only with the buffet spread but the level of care, sincerity and obvious personal investment shown for the restaurant's success.
veg samosas also offered and were quite crispy and delicious, which is not what I'm accustomed to at "other" buffets. Fried food is usually soggy unless you get it within 30 minutes or so of coming out.
I appreciate that both vegetarian and meat options were available and oh, the naan they brought was pretty darn good. Also, chai tea at the buffet. You sweeten yourself. Loved!
This is our new place for great Indian food and service :)"}

It was the best of times and it was the mediocre, luke warmest of times and yet I regret never trying the dessert when it was offered to me. I would really give them a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to four stars because of the customer service. Anyway, the glutton in me is constantly on the lookout for buffets so when I found this gem about 15 minutes from my job I decided to take a chance. I had only had Indian food once before from a mall food court place and I barely remember anything about it. The first time I came here, about a month ago, I came on a good day. The service was really attentive and everyone was super friendly which was constant - they have great customer service. I liked that it was a serve yourself lunch buffet and I think my total bill, with tip, came to $14 or so. They offer you a choice of regular nan or garlic nan when you are first seated. I tried a little bit of everything but fell in love with the curry chicken but the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, and biriyani are good too. I also tried the mango lassi and it was everything. If you like mango and you like yogurt and you like creamy drinks, order a mango lassi. I was a little pressed for time so I declined having any dessert but I didn't see where the dessert was anywhere in the buffet (it's a small buffet) so I don't even know what the options were. I came back a week later and had a totally different experience. I had been thinking about New India Gate since I left, seriously. I think I came after a large group because they were pretty much cleaned out. The buffet needed to be replenished badly, there was no chicken in the chicken curry and everything else was slim pickings and only slightly warm at that. I didn't even eat my tandoori chicken because it was only a notch above cold to the touch - completely different experience than my first time, sadly. Also, no one ever asked me what I wanted to drink; I had to flag someone down to order my mango lassi which was mostly ice this time, to my disappointment. I also wasn't asked if I wanted dessert and again, since I didn't know where the dessert was, I just left without I haven't been back since then because I quickly got over my Indian food kick after that last time. I'll definitely be back but it'll be a while, I'm sure they will redeem themselves."}

When the door was opened, I can smell curry at every corner of the restaurant. Most of the tables are full and majority of the clients are Indians. That is usually a sign that their food is super authentic. Since I don't know much about Indian food, I basically took a little bit of different curry to try out. Wow it was absolutely delicious. Each table also comes with either plain or garlic bread. I dipped it into the curry sauce and it was so heavenly. By the time I was on my 2nd plate, I was already full.

Classy, open, and the tables are far enough apart that you only hear your dinner companion's voice. 

Service was in the top 10%. We were greeted, seated promptly, and everyone we came into contact with was polite. Seriously some of the best service I've ever had at ANY restaurant. 

Now for the most important part: phenomenal food! I started off with a chai tea and I haven't stopped thinking about it since... the chai is a must! They also brought us over some complimentary pappadam with some mint and mango chutneys on the side. Both were delicious. Entree-wise I recommend the madras vegetables--easily the best I've ever had. (It's my go-to Indian food order so I consider myself somewhat of an aficionado.) The paratha and lamb vindaloo were also delicious. The medium was not very spicy so if you like hot, get hotter than you normally would. 

My partner and I ate all our food which is unusual for us; it was just THAT good! It's important to note that entree portions were a little smaller than Indian restaurants usually are, but in the end we didn't mind that much because we firmly believe in quality over quantity. It was still reasonably priced at about $40 for the two of us.

My GF and I are ethnic food junkies and have been pretty disappointed with the Indian offerings in the valley.  We have our favorite spots in the cities we travel to, but rarely eat Indian in the valley as mediocrity plagues this cadre of restauranteurs.  
This spot appeared as a hot and new listing on Yelp, with 5 stars, but only 40 reviews.  Low rating always leave me feeling a bit skeptical, but what the hell, we had nothing to lose.  
The restaurant had a relatively modern and minimalistic, yet warm feel.  
One of the sons of the owner and chef greeted and sat us.  He was extremely personable and took a interest in our 17 month old.  He helped us review the menu and gave his recommendations.  He also told us that if we have some favorite dishes that weren't on the menu, to just ask, as his father had been a chef for many years.  We took the the challenge and ordered the Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower entree).  Plus we ordered several other entrees as we like to bring Indian food home as it usually makes great leftovers.  We ordered the lamb madras, an interesting chicken dish that incorporated egg in the sauce, and yet another item not on the menu, chili chicken.  We customized our order of naan, adding chilies and garlic.  Everything tasted great and to our surprise, the non menu items were our favorite.  The Gobi Manchurian rocked.  It was better than any other I have had.  
It is family owned and got to meet the two brothers/ sons of the owner.  Both incredibly personable.  
We are very excited to return and even more excited about eating the leftovers today."}

This restaurant sure did pass the Indian/Punjabi litmus test. We ordered saag(cooked mustard leaves) and onion kulcha(stuffed bread with onion, potatoes). Both these dishes were completely amazing! The saag was perfect and reminiscent of the authentic way it is prepared back at home. No extra cream or oil was added and had a subtle blend of spices. Similarly, the kulcha was original without any frills. We also ordered pistachio kulfi. It's basically a semi-solid frozen dessert which gave us both the final aa-ha moment!

As a sidekick they also serve Indian beers which, are 8% alcohol with 650ml volume, twice as effective as American beers. In case anyone is up for a trip!

Service was great, everyone is attentive and takes good care of you. I also heard some good Punjabi music. They, definitely deserve a five star."}

The service and the food were both great. I went for dinner the first time and then back twice since for the lunch buffet. All three were great. The buffet had some different dishes than other Indian restaurants than I've been to and the dishes weren't the same the two times I went which I love. To me that's part of what I love about buffets is getting to try different foods without having to order a whole meal of it. Each time they had some staples like chicken tikka which is my go to Indian meal. Love it. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Indian food and friendly staff. Enjoy"}

The server told us his father is the cook and he is always there he never lets anyone else cook to keep their quality high. We had our toddler with us and they even brought him out his own rice on the house. When we couldn't decide on dessert he brought us a sample of the one we decided against.

Convincing my husband to try it with me took years.  I was pleasantly surprised when my hubby stopped here on our mini date night.  The room was smaller than we thought it would be but ended up being perfect! It was so relaxing. And quiet. I had a lovely glad of wine, and hubby tried Taj Mahal beer. Nothing particularly special about the wine. It had nice notes and was served in a perfect amount not chinsey at all. The beer however i had a sip it was crisp and clean but also left a pleasant reminder on The pallet.   The service/servers were so helpful in giving us recommendations and telling us what was most authentic. They were kind and patient. Overall very friendly and polite.  We enjoyed the veggie appetizer. The chickpea batter was on point!! The veggie fritter type item was my fave. Full of flavor , crispy, and great with the sauces they brought to the table.  The Potato samosa thing was also very good.  Seasoned beautifully.  There was a delicious cracker item they bring to the table that was dlish. The sauces one green had a bit of heat to it.  The brownish red sauce kinda Smokey,  kinda sweet was my fave.  Hubby had tive lamb vindaloo. He liked it quite a bit.  Said his lamb was cooked perfectly,  wansn't to soft had just the right bite to it. He got a medium spice, but said he should have done more heat. He likes spicy. I did taste the sauce it was rich and i could really taste the tomato base each flavor really stood on its own despite the level of spice.  I cannot remember what the name of my meal choice was.  It was recommend by the server. Loved that they had so much vegetarian items.... in my meal the sauce was amazing!! It was kinda sweet and creamy, so rich, full of spices. ..i could have swam in it it was so amazing. I soaked it up with garlic naan bread which was on its own a nice treat.  Back to my awesome meal; it had these veggie dumpling things in it which complimented the sauce nicely,  or maybe it was supposed to be the other way around. I cannot wait to return and try something new.  Maybe stop by for the lunch buffet."}

This restaurant has been under new ownership for the past year. We came here just for take out. They have a casual but clean restaurant. They seemed to have a good lunch buffet going. We ordered the chicken biriyani and tandoori mixed platter. We got it Indian hot which was quite spicy so if be careful before you order it. We enjoy spicy food so we liked it. 
The food was above average and better than a lot of the other AZ Indian joints. Being a big fan of Indian food I have a high standard for Indian food. 
The meat was moist and not dried out. The biriyani was well spiced and had a good amount of meat in it. The mango lassi was really good.

The menu had a lot of options for appetizers, entrees, drinks, desserts and they had a good beer selection too. We ordered the veggie appetizer sampler, 3 entrees, garlic and plain naan, and rice. (With 2 entrees they give you rice). Food came out on time and delicious. Everyone who helped us was nice and we always had our waters refilled. We needed something to cool down the spice so my mom ordered a mango lassi. I normally wouldn't be able to drink it because I have a dairy allergy but our server, Gopi, was very accommodating and said they could try to make one with coconut milk for me but it was something they've never done. The mango lassi with coconut milk was delicious!!! Not as sweet as a traditional one but still so yummy!!! He also let me know right off the bat what desserts were dairy based and which ones had a tolerable amount. I ended up ordering the Gulab Joman. Gopi was so awesome!!! he was probably the friendliest and caring server I've had. The food was good, but the service is amazing and will be back because of it. Check this place out!"}

Paneer tikka felt like tomato gravy. Palak paneer was just horrible. We had buffet and would not recommend to any one. I just don't know how they have so many positive reviews.

Forgot to mention, the deserts were so bad that frozen deserts will be 1000 times better!!!!"}

I've long been a fan of Indian food and have been searching the valley for my favorite.  New India Gate did a great job last night with the food and even more so on the service side of the house.  The people running the restaurant were wonderfully friendly, professional, and a joy to talk to.  The server was exceptional and we never needed anything throughout the evening.  

The food was very good as well and started with a table share of papadum which was good but could have been a touch crispier.  A Veg korma, chicken tikka masala, a lamb in a rich wonderful sauce, and a biryani dish all followed and were very good.  Of course we asked for tons of Naan which if I make it to heaven, will just be laying around me at all times.  I have no idea why I love it so much but we tried their plain and garlic and both were legit.  

Surprisingly nice beers here on tap which is always a plus offering your standard Taj Mahal and Kingfisher but also had some nice "micros" like Voodoo Ranger, a nice juicy IPA from New Belgium Brewing.

Looking forward to hitting their lunch buffet soon to check that out but I certainly will be back to New India Gate for tasty food and awesome service."}

The samosas were super delicious, crispy on the outside and there was a ton of filling. They also brought out garlic naan to the table too. To top it all off, the service was incredible.

The staff were the most welcoming people.  They took the time to explain about the papadum and the tamarind sauce and the green chutney.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that we are veteran indian food lovers. 
 
We tried the beef samosas as an appetizer.  We got two of them that had a nice size to them and they were almost greaseless.  They were also full of meat.  I just wished that they had more aromatic herbs in them.  Maybe a touch more of cardamon.  
Ordered the New India Gate biryani which has both lamb and chicken.  It was not greasy but the flavors were not as good as we expected.  We have had much better.  The portion was big for the price.  The texture of the rice was fine.  
We also ordered chicken vindaloo which was delicious by my standards.  Had that nice vinegary taste that traditional vindaloo is supposed to have and had plenty of potato chunks to soak up that wonderful sauce.  I was super pleased with my selection.
For dessert, I had Kheer and though the raisins and nuts were missing, I enjoyed it nonetheless.  
The customer service is excellent.  Reason enough to go and be served good indian food.  They give a Yelp discount of which we took advantage.  I hear they have a buffet 7 days a week at a reasonable price.  
Thanks for the great meal."}

Craig: That's true. I agree. And the food is also excellent. I haven't had a bad dish. 

Me: Yes! The food has been amazing every time. And we've been here three times each, twice together. Some places are hit or miss, but this place is consistently good. 

Craig: The standout favorite is the chicken tikka masala. But the garlic naan is also naan-stop. 

Me: I'm not typing that. Pick another adjective. 

Craig:

Me: Fine. *rolls eyes* The beef samosas were good. I like their papadam and tamarind sauce. And we've had the aloo ghobi and aloo matar, which were both very tasty. 

Craig: I'd order any of that again, but there are so many options I'd like to try out some other items. 

Me: I also like the airy, spacious feeling of the restaurant. And I like the shiny wall. It's definitely not super decorated, but it's nice and feels neat and clean. 

Craig: Yeah, clean and modern. And the music is nice in the background. It's there, but it's not oppressive. 

Me: This place isn't busy on weeknights. Frankly, it should be much busier, but I kind of love that I don't have to wait. And I love that they never close. Like ever. Sunday, Monday, holidays, zombie apocalypse. Whatever. They're open. 

Craig: I feel like we skimmed over the service too quickly. They've earned more screen time. 

Me: Definitely! They'll give you honest opinions about what's best on your menu. Your drink will never have a chance to get below the halfway mark. But they never feel like they're crowding you. 

Craig: I think you've covered it.

Me: We never talked about the stars. 

Craig: It was a given maybe. 

Me: Yeah, five stars for service and food. Four and a half stars on the decor."}

I get it, words are hard and all, but you're not just talking about Taco Bell...this is New India Gate.

This restaurant is fantastic.  The interior is immaculately clean and spacious, and that lunch buffet cannot be beat.  I could sit there and much on saag paneer and tikka masala and naan all freaking day.  But like...that's a lunch buffet.  Even the best buffet can only be so good, so then why the 5 stars?

I'll tell you why the 5 freaking stars you nosy jerks: because New India Gate gives a crap.  Because I once ordered New India Gate via Postmates or UberEats or RideShareFoodsters or whatever, and it was a fairly hearty order - some chicken tikka masala, some chicken vindaloo (as hot as they'll make it...delicious), some samosas, some garlic naan.  You should have SEEN this order.  It was packaged immaculately.  Each individual food container was wrapped in some cling wrap to prevent spilling any of the saucy entrees. The different types of naan were wrapped in their own foil to keep them warm.  And then once all those beautiful little packages were unwrapped, what we were greeted with was food.

Glorious, colorful, flavorful, plentiful food.  Food rife with delicate sauces and perfectly cooked rice and delicious naan.  This food was even better than the buffet food even though both were arguably of about the same freshness, and I think some of that is just the care put into these individual meals. All special requests were followed religiously.  

That meal was so good that exactly one week later, we ordered again.  Not the exact same meal, but close.  Same wrapping. Same packaging. Same level of amazingness to the food.  So we ordered again the next week.  At this point it's more often than not that we order New India Gate on a Sunday night...not out of some obligation to a ritual, but just because it just so happens that by the time a 7th day is about to pass, we realize it has been too long since we had New India Gate and we need to have it again.  

I love you, New India Gate."}

The restaurant had a fairly steady stream of customers here, always a good sign! The buffet had a good mix of vegetable, fried, and meat dishes. Dishes today included saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and biriyani. My favorites were the fish curry and the malai kofta (Vegetable fritters in curry sauce). 

Dessert consisted of gulab jamun, kheer, fresh watermelon, and carrot halwa. The dishes all tasted pretty good, no complaints on my end! The spice level was just right for a buffet. Not too mild but with a slight kick to make it about a low to medium level for me.

Service was friendly and attentive. In addition to the buffet items they will bring fresh naan to your table which was plentiful and refilled as needed.

My favorite Indian buffet is still Chutney's but New India Gate is cheaper and also has a good variety so it is a close second! This is a great option for lunch and I'll definitely be back again."}

Very disappointed with the Lunch buffet.
The quality has deteriorated since my last visit.
I have been impressed with their food but this was nothing close to what they used to offer.

The buffet is priced at $9.95 on weekends.
The spread was average no appetizers 
Chicken biriyani was in a sorry state, curries were just Okay.
Dishes were not being refilled.

Garlic naan was brought to the table which was great other items like basmati rice, custard and Kheer were fresh.
Gulab jamun was outright bad 
We barely touched our food.

Not going back for the buffet.
Cheers!"}

We went for a buffet lunch, as we entered we were seated and asked if we wanted a regular or a garlic naan. We chose mix of both naan. 

The options were very few compared to the other Indian buffet lunch places we have been to. The lamb/ goat curry was tasteless. The Biryani, we have to rename for this place. Most of the food was missing the authentic Indian flavor. Everything was too bland and had absolutely no taste. My stars go for the ambience, its clean and for the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala. I hardly had rest of the food, the chicken tandoori was the worst. 

It was my first experience and I am never coming back again. The price is really not worth for the food they serve here. Please save yourself from this place."}

Granted my friends are regulars here and the owners know them,  Golbi introduced himself & was very friendly. I started off with the vegetable samosa which was delicious. It comes with two sauces (Tamarind & mint chutney). the green sauce reminds me of a green chili salsa and the red one is sweet & tangy. Both compliment the samosas very well. Then I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and asked for Indian Hot since I love spicy food. I ordered a side of rice with my dish or you can order a side of the garlic naan that is just as good. If you got an appetite then get both :)  Overall  the food was delicious, service was great and it's a great new addition to the Chandler area.

I've had the Jewish sliders (which are incredible!), the knish, cheese blintz, pastrami sandwich and the chicken matzo ball soup. MUST HAVE THE MATZO BALL SOUP!! I did feel quite full after sharing a large bowl though so prepare for a lot of soup. The knish I had was the potato and onion. I liked it but it was very one note after a while. I had a few bites of my boyfriends mile high pastrami sandwich on challah bread and it was divine!! The challah bread was sweet and amazing and the pastrami was perfect! The blintz is a good sweet dish but also savory. Probably wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.

My dog is friendly and if she does bark, nobody was outside eating. She was behind railing so no threat to others as i know she won't bite anyone.

Our waiter Hoki was wonderful, service was A+. I would advise requesting his section if you ever eat here. 

Their Passion fruit Ice Tea is delicious and our glasses never emptied and were always refreshed with ice on each refill. 

I ordered the Grilled Salmon from the fresh fish selection, it came with Steamed Broccoli and rice. (see pics) It was really good, the Salmon was cooked perfectly. Something I Would definitely order again. 

The Mr. Ordered the Boston House Salad (see pics) I shared a few bites and also enjoyed it. His entree was the Four Cheese Pasta which he really liked too, sorry no pic. 

For dessert we Shared a slice of the Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake (see pics). WOW! That was sinfully good!

But I'm a huge fan of Eggs Benedict so I could decide which to get. Then add soon as I seen you could add a slider to any entree I was excited!! My wife had the Patty Melt and Fries and she said it was good, not to die for but good (it's hard to top the Patty Melt from Johnny Rockets). My Benedict was great! The Hollendaise Sauce was so good I didn't even use ketchup for my Hash Browns. Even the leftovers were great the next day back home!! But there's so much more to try there that I can't wait to go back. Plus the location is great, near so many things to do. I'll see you again soon Chompies!!"}

I've been to every Chompie's in the Valley and so far this one is the most inconsistent.

Really?  we didn't ask for fries...  I asked for an everything bagel and let's just say everything didn't make it on the bagel.  It looked like an onion bagel they forgot to finish putting onions on.  A few of the servers are great but some need to find a new line of work...  For having been a huge Chompie's fan for the past 15 years I can't say this location is living up to my expectations of the Chompie's I have known and loved."}

I've been all over the valley and have gotten pretty good service at the Paradise Valley and University locations. This one just dropped the ball.

I decided to grab a few quick things from the bakery, wasn't even going to sit to eat. I wasn't even greeted by the 2 people standing at the door. I don't usually care about that but it was just another thing atop everything else. After I get inside, I see multiple people waiting around for someone to come to the bakery to be helped, someone finally does and the employee walks away. Its my turn now and are ready to order. 

I stood around for a good five minutes until I started looking for someone to help. As soon as I found the hostess, she started walking away. Listen, I understand that there are plenty of responsibilites of each employee but I didn't even get a look from her. After walking back towards the register, I see an employee writing something down, I think it may have been the manager or something because they didn't look like a waitress. I kind of look at them and they look right back at me and look back down to continue writing something down. No "can I help you?" or "can I get someone for you?". I eventually just lost all hope at that point and left.

Like I said, I love Chompie's. Their jewish sliders and assorted bakery items are off the charts, but this location just fell flat. Me and my friends won't ever step foot in there again. If you have the choice, go to the one on University. Much better service."}

Some of us wanted desert, so that took an extra 45 minutes.  The place is packed with lines coming out the door most of the time.  Personally, I think the food is good, but not good enough to wait for.  I also think prices are pretty high.  Two alcoholic beverages, a main course, and a desert is about 50 bucks a person."}

Yes, yes, that sounds like an awful thing to say! But it really is true, I have had some fabulous seafood dishes in phoenix and some that left a bit to be desired. A group of us came here for the pre-fixe menu. You get an entree and a regular size app for a fixed priced. It's actually a really good deal considering this place is err a little on the pricey side.

We sit down and everyone is super nice! As we wait for our orders, we are brought out some spicy thai like edamame. It was delish!

Before talking about my meal, let's talk about how absolutely knoweldgeable our waitress was. I hate I can't remember her name, but she was SUPERB.. I always say it is nice when you talk with someone who knows the menu down to how the best way to serve it is (i.e. fish should be medium because it loses flavor the longer it's cooked) but offered flexibility when I wanted my potstickers well done (texture always gets me).

My group has the crunch golden pot stickers and calamari - fantastic! They are really setting the tone for me.  For my entree I had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi - this was mahvelous and cooked to absolute perfection. The spicy mustard that accompanied with it took it over the edge! Everything else my group ordered was good as well. People had no complaints which is hard to do in big groups.

Last but not least, dessert. There was some chocolate goodness and something else. I'm not a big fan of desserts, but for those who are.. these were quite tasty!

Would totally go back and Mondays made it way more reasonable."}

When it did my corn beef hash was ice cold with a hot egg on top, that made for a really weird first bite. The food was actually delivered by the General Manager. It was busy and maybe he didn't notice the place was cold. Now I'm not one to send food back so I just ate the bagel. Figured when Alex came back and had seen I only ate the bagel he'd ask. Ha! Nope just said "let me get this out of the way" maybe Alex was having an off day or maybe he was overwhelmed with his section. So I still gave him a good tip. On the way out I see Alex helping a lady pick out cookies in the bakery... good customer service for the lady I guess but what about the 9 tables full of people with no coffee and cold food... oh well, Chompie's is still one of my favorites. Just failed me this morning.

I told them I had a carryout. After a few more minutes the employee came out and said they did not have any corned beef and it would take awhile to prepare. She said the corned beef was in the pot and would take some time to finish. She ask if we wanted to come back or order something else. Why did she take my order on the phone and not tell me at that time they had no corned beef. Having me drive there and then stating they do not have any is ridiculous. They have lost a valued customer and I cannot recommend this location."}

I mentioned it to the server, who then replaced it with a crab dish which came burned to a crisp. Charcoal black, you couldn't even taste the crab. Then came dessert. I can't eat bread, so I asked the server to recommend a cheesecake which might have a little less of it. He brought a lemon raspberry cheesecake, which looked delicious, but had bread underneath the cheesecake, which again, I cannot digest. There was so little raspberry sauce, they should have just called it lemon cheesecake. I mentioned it to the server, who agreed with me, stating that wasn't the portion it should come with. I asked for more of the sauce, he disappeared, then came back and told me I'd be charged extra for it. I complained to the manager, who then told me I'd get a gift certificate for the amount of the check. Over a month has passed, and guess what, no gift certificate! I called about it to complain, and haven't gotten a call back yet.

The food here just isn't as good as it is in the Roy's locations in Hawaii. I thought I might have been too picky the first time we visited this location a few months ago, or perhaps the kitchen was having an off-night, but our food this time around was even worse: 

Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs: should have been savory and melt in your mouth. It was just ok. It was much better prepared on our last visit.

Side dish of Szechuan string beans: I  was appalled. It was a pile of steamed green beans -- that's it. When I asked the server, he checked with the kitchen and said they had sauteed the green beans in the Szechuan sauce. It clearly wasn't, but I asked if I could have some of the sauce on the side, so he brought some. The sauce was ok, but not really Szechuan. From what I could see it was just shoyu and chilipaste. Was pretty miffed I had to even pay for this.

Alaea Salt Crusted Bone in Ribeye - My husband ordered this. It was fine for a steak, but nothing great. The biggest disappointment was the Truffled bacon mac n cheese! It had zilch seasoning, had very little cheese sauce, and there was hardly any bacon. I'm someone who can get by without much seasoning, unlike Ryan who wants 10lbs of salt on everything, but even I thought it was waaaaay underseasoned. 

Raspberry Chocolate Lava Cake (forget the actual name on menu): The last time I was here, I commented that it was a bit chewy. I was hoping for a better one this time, but it was even worse. There was not much oozing of chocolate goodness unfortunately, and the cake was even harder/chewier than last time.

I think if you've never been to Roy's in Hawaii, the food is fine and you'll enjoy your meal here. But if you have been to Roy's in Hawaii, it will be a letdown. There is just no comparison!"}

What I wasn't impressed with was their herb-crusted salmon salad.  Maybe it was the word 'crusted' that got me, but I was assuming the fish was going to be served warm.  Surprise!  It was cold.  I choked down as much as I could, but will be going to Pita Jungle and Keegan's for my salmon salads from now on.

And I cant say enough about their pina colada cake cheesecake.  A true taste of the islands, part cake, part cheesecake, all yummy.  The only things missing were the fire dancers and hula girls.

They do take reservations... for parties of 20 or more."}

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

Absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!"}

Last year I was in Honolulu for my birthday and my wife and I had an amazing dinner at Roy's. When my wife found a Roy's here in Arizona, she thought that it would be a nice surprise for my birthday this year.
We were greeted and promptly sat at a table that had a place card wishing me a happy birthday (very nice touch.) We ordered drinks and ordered. I had tuna poke and my wife had lobster dumplings. Both were fantastic and got my hopes up for the entree. My wife had a filet and I ordered the macadamia nut mahi mahi. My wife's filet was spot on although the whipped potatoes and veg were pedestrian. My mahi on the other hand was terrible. I know, I live hundreds of miles from fresh fish but still. The mahi was cooked until every molecule of water was cooked out. Not only did the fish not flake, it turned into dust (that might be a slight exaggeration but still, it was dry as this god forsaken desert that I live in.)
The complimentary birthday dessert was a nice touch and the flourless chocolate cake was great. 
Service was good but I'm not sure that it was $75 per person good (no steak knife until my wife had finished and my wife's dessert was served 15 minutes after mine.)
I would have to say that my night would have been better at the bar just eating appetizers and dessert."}

I ordered a Dirty Vodka Martini ... after 10 minutes the waiter returned to ask me if I wanted that "neat" ... duh dude. 10 minutes after that our pre-dinner drinks arrived. My second pre-dinner drink arrived after we were served dinner. I had also ordered a bottle of wine for the table.

The wait was long (40 minutes); lucky of us, the shopping mall distracted us.  I had the spicy cashew chicken over rice.  It was NOT spicy; the chicken was bland (because it was pre-boiled?); the sauce was pure hoisin from a jar. Did the cook put the entire jar of hoisin sauce in this dish, and not other spice? The sauce and the chicken did not go together at all.  My wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap.  It was OK at best. We ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream. It was way too sweet; spoon for spoon, pure sugar would be less sweet. Only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good. Oh, one more good thing was the complementary bread and butter served ahead of the meal. The service was average.  So, why is this place so crowded that we had to wait 40 minutes for a table?

So I only scanned the comments with blinders on and only read the good comments. 
But now that were home and I re-read them I realize that almost everyone liked a few things and several things they didn't.  And for the prices they charged I would think everything should have been fantastic.
Well the $100 it cost to eat there for just two entrees, one salad and one Arnold Palmer was an extreme bummer.  It truly was a waste of our hard earned money.  Since they don't post their prices on their website we thought we would give it a try just from the reviews.  Wrong! 
If I knew we were going to spend that much money we could have gone to the Keg which was soooo much better than Roy's by far. 
The short ribs or should I say two little ones had a burnt layer on top that, after chewing forever I still had to discretely put it in my napkin.  You would have thought for $30 dollars they could have given you more than 1/2 cup of running potatoes and few sprigs of asparagus and broccoli.  If the taste was as exquisite as the cost... maaaybe, but NO, total disappointment! 
The medium rare prime rib was at best medium to well done and covered in a thicker like gravy juice, served with a tiny bowl of Mac N Cheese? Even the ranch dressing had no flavor compared to even Denny''s ... another disappointment. You might let it go by if you were at Steer and Stein.  But when you are going out for your anniversary and a very special time together and figure it's worth the splurge you can't help feel completely disappointed.

Get my drink order right. I'm not the type to order something crazy, at least not for drinks, but I find watered down drinks disgusting. The server at chompies did the one thing that gets me in a bad mood, add ice to my soda when I specifically ask for no ice. 

Now, it is the first time I have even gone to chompies and the menu was very lengthy. Not something that I mind but every sandwich seemed to have coleslaw on it. I was actually quite surprised about the entire homey atmosphere here as I always envisioned chompies to be like einsteins. 

Once the food came out I discovered that when the menu said horseradish they meant the sauce kind. There seemed to be a long wait for our food and it was cold when it was served. They also gave fruit instead of the requested Coleslaw with my boyfriends sandwich. 

Taste wise it was decent but nothing spectacular. I don't think I will be coming here again any tim"}

I visit this restaurant about 4 times a year. This past visit was probably one of the worst. Ok, maybe it was the worst.
I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. $16.95. This is one of my favs but this time the chicken was a bit over cooked. I'm not a fan of dry chicken. The rest of the dish was ok.
K ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. $17.95. She had to ask for additional sauce because it came out with very little sauce. At least they didn't charge us for it. The sauce was good. The rice was a bit on the undercooked side. The chicken was fine.
C ordered the Buffalo Strips $9.99. $10.99 with fries. This is a great deal. 8 large breaded chicken tenders for $9.99. An extra buck for fries. Heck of a deal.
Grandma C ordered the Carolina BBQ sandwich. $12.95. She didn't eat it because it was chunked pork, not pulled.
Now the bad stuff;
First off, charging $4.50 for a Strawberry lemonade for my son is RIDICULOUS. Second, I think $7.50, $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake is too much. Especially when the whole cheesecake is around $50. And lastly, the Carolina BBQ sandwich is described as being made with pulled pork. It is not. It is made with pork chunks. Not very good for a sandwich. We told the manager we were not pleased with the sandwich but in the middle of our debate on the merits of pulled pork vs pork chunks the fire alarm went off. FOR 10+ MINUTES. (We learned from a server that the key needed to turn off the alarm was taken home by one of the new managers. So the fire dept was on it's way to turn off the alarm) I think a good portion of the guests left after a few minutes because the ear piercing blaring noise of the fire alarm was a bit much to take. We stayed. I was hoping to finish our conversation with the manager but he never returned. We also had hoped that the pork sandwich would be taken off the bill. It wasn't. And we hoped that the Mgr would buy a slice of cheesecake to make up for the sandwich. He didn't. We sat through that blaring alarm for nothing except for an "I can't believe you stayed" from our server. You know what? I can't believe we stayed either.
I did find it interesting when the server mentioned about the Mgr taking the key home she told us they had 4 new managers. Hmmm. Wonder Y.
Management & food; 2 stars."}

We rolled in a little after 9ish, and business was quite slow at this time ... I believe there might have been a few people in the bar area and only another two top in the dining room area.  Needless to say we were seated fairly promptly and the hostess seemed pleasant.

A server greeted us promptly, and since neither of us had been here before and there was a rather extensive menu it took us a few minutes to ask the waiter questions and review our possible menu choices.  I opted to try a Hawaiin (pineapple) Martini, and my friend had a glass of wine.  I must admit the pineapple Martini was delicious and a very well balanced cocktail. 

The server asked us if we would like some complimentary edamame, and I must say I believe they flavored the edamame with some sort of hawaiin spice/flavoring because they tasted quite delicious and different from the typical bland heavily salted edamame.... it was nice.

I decided to try the surf and turf option - filet mignon and lobster tail.  It was very reasonably priced at under $60, and it was very good.  I was actually impressed the lobster was soooo yummy.  My medium filet was nicely flavored hawaiin style and it was accompanied with bearnaise sauce, which is one of my favorite dipping sauces for filet, so I was quite pleased.  I will admit it's not the best lobster tail or piece of filet that I have ever had, so it was not absolutely exceptional, but it was great tasting based on the price and portion size - it hit the spot and the plate presentation was very nice too!! The broccolini was a nice light side.  

My friend tried the half chicken dinner and seemed to like it ... However, I did not try it, so I really can't give any sort of extensive review about it.

Overall, I would probably rate Roy's a solid 4.5 star review if that was possible.  We really enjoyed our dinners/adult beverages, the service was very good, the overall ambiance and look of the restaurant was was appealing, and the reasonable price point/portions were spot on!  I would absolutely recommend Roy's to others, and I am sure I'll be back to have another filet/lobster tail dinner with a Hawaiin twist at some point in the future!"}

I'll definitely be back for lunch again here soon. The portions are gigantic and enabled me to have enough leftovers for a second meal. They also have a skinny cocktail list that is a nice touch.

It's one of the closest-to-authentic NY Style Jewish delis in Arizona.  Plus... their 1/2 sandwich and soup special is a great deal!

FOOD: Get their matzo ball soup.  It is delicious.  I also love any of their sliders, their turkey sandwiches, their corned beef... It's all good.  I get all my sandwiches on either seedless rye or on challah.  Yum.

Also... they serve both kosher and half-sour pickles.  I am not a pickle fan, but their half-sours are ADDICTIVE.  I could make a whole meal out of them if my blood pressure would forgive me.  Salty goodness - yum!

They also have daily specials like Fish Fry Fridays (I believe it is after 4).  Check their website for details.

SERVICE: David is THE BEST server at Chompie's.  He remembers me and DD every time we stop in.  Even if we are not seated in his section, he stops by to say hello.  This kind of service is what brings us back to Chompie's again and again.  He also gives DD the best cookies with her meal.

VALUE: It's excellent.  Kids eat free (1 per adult entree purchased) on Mondays and Tuesdays.  They get a generous sized meal and can choose from about 15 or so meals.  You do have to pay for a drink, but it is well-worth it.

I was doing a sales type dinner, so I looked on Yelp for a good restaurant - Roy's popped up - just around the corner from the office and rated highly.  Without knowing anything, the plan was laid.

The dinner started with edemame - nicely steamed (but a little over-cooked in my opinion - still very good), covered in a mix of salt and sweet - brown sugar, perhaps?  Definitely delicious.  Then we ordered the Roys Canoe Appetizer and a Lobster California Roll.  I highly recommend the Szechuan Pork Ribs off the Canoe, but everything was excellent.  The ribs got more than one complement.

Our main courses were mostly from the sea.  I had the chicken breast of the night which came with bacon gravy and sweet potato puree.  The sweet potato puree was sweet, but the bacon gravy more than made up for it.  I mean, honestly, how can you go wrong with bacon gravy?  The other main courses all got good reviews.

On to dessert and coffee.  One of my dining companions opted for the pineapple upside down cake, and the other for pumpkin cheesecake.  When they came out, they were works of art - comments like "it's a shame to eat it", but they managed it anyway, and commented on how delicious they were.  The cappuchinos around the table were also savored.

Through it all, we had some of the best service I have encountered.  It wasn't obtrusive, but there was always someone close by to assist.

My only complaint (and its common among a lot of restaurants) is that when asked for a recommendation, waitstaff always point to the most expensive thing on the menu.  Either that or they go the marginally less informative route of saying 'well, everything is good'.  Seriously guys - you need to step up and say what YOU like."}

I have been to Roy's at many locations and especially enjoyed the Roy's on Maui, but this is one of my favorites.  This place is amazing with a reoccurring Hawaiian theme, whats not to love!  It is a mix of European techniques and Asian cuisine while meeting Hawaiian hospitality.

Honestly, I love the Seared Ahi Tuna and get this dish most of the times come. But when I decide to change it up, I am never disappointed.  For the appetizers we loved the crunchy golden lobster pot-stickers, for the salads we loved the roasted beet salad and grilled pear salad and for the entrees (besides the Ahi Tuna) the crab dynamite baked barramundi is delicious(a little rich so be prepared),  the mahi mahi and Hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish is absolutely mouth watering!!! If you are reading this, you must go and try :)  I also heard from one of my friends that the filet mignon is one of the best around.  I have not had the chance yet to give it a whirl. So maybe a surf & turf next? Last but not least is the dessert.  This may be my favorite at any restaurant out there.  Roy's Chocolate Souffle.  A delicious chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a tad of raspberry sauce - it literally melts in your mouth.  This is a MUST, make sure you order it!  Remember, there is always room for dessert!

Monday nights are usually a fix priced 3-course menu, so you should check it out. Great deal if they still offer.

My friend and I have dined here many times and we have had some issues in the past with take-out food, so make sure your order is correct before leaving.

First time here, came with my friend for restaurant week in September.
We came on a Thursday night around 7:30 - mostly empty restaurant. The hostess was really sweet. The place itself is clean, and the decor is nice.

We were especially disappointed in the server. He seemed overwhelmed, even though there were plenty of other servers there; he was overall inattentive. This seemed especially prominent once he realized we were doing restaurant week - maybe he didn't think he would get the same kind of tip as a table ordering off the regular menu? Not sure. At one point, a second server even came over to "help out", but was equally rushed and didn't really seem to help much. Our server also disappeared for long stretches, especially when we were ready for the check, and came back smelling like smoke. It would have been okay if we could have flagged someone else down - there were plenty of servers standing around - but we weren't able to and had to wait 15-20 minutes just for the check!

I really could have forgiven the poor service if the food had been good, but it was just average.
Best things we had:
- Lobster potstickers - amazing, very good!
- Grilled salmon - pretty good, nothing outstanding but a solid dish

Everything else was just "meh", including:
- Teppanyaki Shrimp ... not good, bland, mushy fried rice
- Grilled ceasar salad
- Desserts - the choclate dessert and the raspberry cheesecake, both just fine, nothing special.

Overall, for a $100 meal, I would have expected much better - at least on either the service end or the food end. Both could use some improvement.
No wonder the place wasn't busy."}

We must have had an off night or bad waiter last time. We decided to celebrate our anniversary one more time here, and we're glad. The food was amazing, and service was much more the norm. 

We came to the special Roy Yamaguchi dinner and wine pairing. It was fabulous. Roy made an appearance and was so nice. He took pics with those of us taking part in the special dinner pairing, as well as the regular dining crowd. That was a great treat. Best of all, we had the special happy anniversary dessert. Loved it! Thanks. 

Old: 
So, I still enjoy coming here - mostly. And I wish I could do 31/2 stars. But I've not been as happy with the service. It was our 21st anniversary at our most recent visit...and no flowers on table (at first), no card, no special treat - we used to get a mini dessert with happy anniversary on the plate. Even the upside down pineapple cake didn't have happy anniversary on the plate. Super disappointing. Good food and cocktails overall, though. But my rare filet was more medium rare. Our waiter didn't check back to make sure all was good before we were mostly finished. And we got a frown when we tried to use a $20 off coupon. Hopefully next time will be better for the amount paid."}

However, the last few times we've been there, the quality of the food has declined and the service is really bad. It seems as if the whole staff has completely turned over and I feel that's why the service has declined so significantly. For example, this morning, my husband and I went around 9:30. We checked in with the hostess and sat at the bar so we could watch the World Cup match. We sat for 10 minutes and nobody came to see if we needed water or if we were ready to order. There was a gentleman sitting a couple of chairs over, at the bar area, and he had food and the manager came to check on him. After 10 minutes, we left. As we were walking out, the hostess and 2 servers were standing by the hostess station talking and just watched us walk out. I won't be back. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because their bagels and breads are good. It is also one of the few places I can get my poppy seed bagel. I guess I will have to get it to go if I want one."}

Portions are ginormous.  Wife got the meatloaf which had 3 slices easily weighing over 1lb so 2 slices went in the doggie bag for...the dogs!   I got the fish tacos which were ehh, if you've had them in SoCal none can compare.  We also got the blueberry cheese cake to go and that was pretty good also. 

Why 3 stars?   Nothing wrong with our experience but nothing great.  If you've been to one and want to go back it's a sure bet, it's a chain restaurant with no true authenticity, but a menu the same length of a Harry Potter novel so everyone can be pleased for their meal."}

The butterfish melted in one's mouth.  Didn't know you could change the order of the rice, but the black rice was good.  The spare ribs were good and plenty for appetizers.  A lot bigger than I thought.

The dessert was a little too much for me in terms of quantity.  It's a lot for a single serving and probably could've been like 2 servings instead.

The restaurant wasn't too noisy but we were seated in a secluded area, so that's why it was probably quieter.  Nice ambiance.  Will be back."}

We received an email invitation from Roy's that Caymus Winery was hosting a Wine Dinner with limited seating. The menu preview sounded fantastic, so we jumped on it.

Apparently Caymus Wineries hosts this Wine Dinner every year. It started off with a Mix & Mingle introducing their Champagne and an introduction to their wines and a short video of the history of the winery. Then followed the 5 course dinner paired each with a different wines. We started with the Dungeness Crab then the Sea Scallop & Foie Gras, followed by an Alaskan Black Cod and a Wagyu Beef Short Rib, finally to end with a Baked Alaska. All the while sipping on their selections of Caymus Blended White, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. All the dishes and wine pairings were absolutely spectacular!

Again keep in mind this was a Roy's hosted event with Caymus Wines and a representative along with Roys serving staff and chef to make these special dishes for this occasion. 

Private room, service and food 5 STAR! I would recommend this to anyone next year when Caymus Wineries comes back."}

I should mention we only do To Go orders. As we work full time and have 4 children, no time for anything else. 

Tonight, I started calling them to place a order about 25 minutes before arriving there. I was on hold the entire time. When I get there I see my call on hold while the place is actually empty. The place was empty, almost no clients but servers chatting around. 

I ordered a Cesar salad and paid $15 for it. I drove another 25 min home and when I sit down to eat (see picture) they ONLY had plain lettuce on my salad. Who in this world would pay $15 for a pot of lettuce. 

Yesterday, I ordered chicken wings and they were literally burned.

The food was another story.   I ordered the sword fish off the Chef's Creations menu and the green beans.   I've never had sword fish that was so tender.  It was delicious.  The star of the meal for me was the szechuan green beans. They were flavored with what looked like small slices of Andouille sausage.  Crispy tender and perfectly spiced.   I would consider ordering the larger size for an entrée.

NevertheWoodyAllenless, Chompie's does a wonderful Jewish deli impression.

Wait! Not an impression. It's the real, cop-a-feel deal Holyfield.

There's a meat market near the entrance, with acres of sausage (heyooo!) and a bakery for takeout, with all the usual delicatessen suspects. Off to the side (not a sideshow so much as it's the main event) is a brightly lit, "don't even think of comparing us to Applebee's" casual, sit-down restaurant. 

Whether gorging at home or in public, Chompie's is your Heavenly, Hebrew enabler in case your "I only eat healthy chick food" waistline has a deathwish.

What a way to go, ho!

- fantastic soups of the day
-  salad, done right (as in, mostly dressing, cheese and [chosen meat], with a token 
   offering of lettuce
- sandwiches that consist of a huge platter of meat with a couple of triangles of toast 
   hidden somewhere beneath
- gravy, Gravy, GRAVY
- pickles. On EVERYTHING.
- French fries that are served in portions large enough to share with everyone at your 
   table, or at least one very fat man.
- attentive servers that aren't snooty or b*tchy or ignorey (not a word, but whatever)

The only possible drawback is the slightly Disneylandish pricing of the food, but meh, it's not really Futureland-bad. 

And anyway, would you rather have a $15 Mickey Mouse pencil topper that you'll end up losing in your P.E. locker under a bunch of socks, or a $15 Reuben sandwich that can feed an African nation for the foreseeable future?

It would also be a nice place to take your international friends from China or Mexico. That's because the atmosphere and interior is well designed. When I took my mom here yesterday, she was in awe. "Wow, this place looks great!"

That's all that the Cheesecake Factory offers.

The waiter brought us two empty plates. The dishwasher didn't clean it correctly, so he exchanged it for new ones right away.

The food is not great. That's why you shouldn't bring your spouse here for an anniversary or have a first date here. My mom ordered a pasta and we both agreed that it tasted bland. 

Finally, we shared a slice of cheesecake and my mom ordered a coffee. The slice of cheesecake was good, but it's not worth the money.

The lunch+dessert+coffee+tip was around $34 that day. The place has a great atmosphere, but the food isn't worth anywhere near $34."}

I love Cheesecake Factory and all I needed (wanted) in my life was a slice of their cheesecake. Long story short, I didn't get it. Sad day. 

The wait was practically nonexistent, though I did have to wait for just a few minutes for the hostess to return, since there was seemingly only one on duty for the beginning of dinner. Not terrible. We sat down and this is where the waiting really happened. It took a little while to get waters, then to get our drinks ordered, and then to order. A lot of time was spent waiting for the waiter to come back and check up on us and to get our bill. I needed to get going for a movie, and I knew that if I had ordered that darn cheesecake, we would have been sitting around even longer. I'll come back here for sure, but I was just less than impressed with my experience this time around."}

It has a great counter where you can look at all of their meats and desserts.

When I stopped there last, I got a little more than I bargained for. I stopped in to get a take-away bagel and the customer in front of me was being very difficult. They did not want to pay for their cream cheese, okay I get it there are difficult people. When this difficult lady left, I just wanted to move on and not dwell upon it. Then the cashier continues to complain to me as I was placing my order. It felt very awkward to be complain to and I tried my best to change the topic but it just kept coming up.

Furthermore, I got a earful when the cashier started yelling at one of the servers right in front of my very eyes. Then the server went into the kitchen and started yelling at someone else.

This is a great place and I have been coming here for years, but I think I will reconsider knowing how much drama there is here. I hope they can improve how they behave in front of their customers."}

Why? Well, first of all because our table was really wobbly and would move whenever we'd lift up our drinks to take a sip, or move ANYTHING on the table. Second, because it was so freaking COLD in there, due to the ceiling fan above us on full speed and the A/C blowing down. I shivered the entire duration of the meal. 

Our friend had to keep reminding the waitress, and the helper who helped serve our food, that he ordered cocktail sauce for his All You Can Eat Fish & Chips. It took FOREVER to get that to him! We all got the Fish & Chips Friday Special...while it was pretty good, my fries were too done for me to the point I could only finish about half of them...and just having recent oral surgery, I couldn't eat anything super hard or crunchy due to sensitivity and the surgery areas in the process of healing. My fish, however, was just right and I could eat it without fail. 

Took home a piece of Red Velvet Cake for dessert. The cake itself was dry and the frosting was perfect. I was rather disappointed. Also, the floor inside the restaurant was slick and felt greasy. That itself is a safety hazzard."}

I have an unhealthy obsession with the Cheesecake Factory. Yes yes, this is a chain, I know. But honestly, I don't give a flying f*** if its a chain or an independent restaurant owned by some cute little family down the road. As long as the food is delicious and plentiful, the service fast and friendly, the cost is palatable,  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant, I will be a fan of any place. After all, isn't that what writing reviews and being a foodie is about?
I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I can't think of a time when I had a non pleasant experience. Yes, there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others, but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service. 
If you have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know about their menu. It is literally a book! They pride themselves in having something for everyone so there are tons of items to choose from. Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong: 

Appetizers:
- Sweet corn tamale cakes
- Fried chicken sliders
- Avocado Eggrolls
- Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot. They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids
- Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not, their clam chowder is the best I have ever had

Entrees:
- Chicken Costelleta
- Chicken Chipotle Pasta
- BBQ Ranch chicken salad
- Salisbury chopped steak
- Crispy spicy beef
- Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavors

Keep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. You could share one entree with another person and get an appetizer and be stuffed yet not spend alot. Now I will admit that there were some things I had at the CC Factory that were not that great. The crabcake burger is too greasy and overpowering, and their mac and cheese balls are nothing impressive. But the good far outweigh the bad and there definitely is something for everyone. Heck, if anything, there is always the cheesecake which they have in every flavor imaginable. Try the dutch apple or carrot, these are my favorites!"}

The Hot and Sour soup was a bit spicy but so tasty.  The entrees all great as well.  We were all given $20 to return in the next few weeks, we will go back for sure to take advantage of that."}

She was saving herself for some pie. she ordered the nachos app. and a salad. the side salad was great but the nachos were over whelming for her. Her eye got really big. she knew she couldn't finish them. As a good son I helped put a nice dent to it. I gat the spicy chicken pasta with asparagus. It was great. I almost didn't want to get a piece of pie. But we were here. And we were an hour away form home. Not chance on taking that home. So we got a piece. Each. Yup she went with the favorite. Fresh strawberries on top of her pie. I went with the Apple strudel. It was amazing like always. Are plates were great proportion. The pie was also great. Our waiter gave us great service.

The portion sizes are also ridiculously large and food too unhealthy. I avoided this place for years until the last year when someone really wanted to go here, and I forced myself to go. When I showed up, I was pleasantly surprised by their Skinnylicious menu which has options 590 calories or less. It's a sizable and diverse menu. That immediately won me over. Of course the other large portions/unhealthy options are still there, but I can appreciate the increased sensitivity to a nutrition-conscious customer. Flash forward another few months, Cheesecake Factory started including calorie information on their menu. Another added bonus. I know nutrition in America is heading in this direction but nevertheless, I am still impressed.

They offer bread as an appetizer that always arrives at the table warm! Menu options are bountiful and food types vary greatly. Everything usually tastes good. Their cheesecake is AMAZING! But, it's extremely sugary and fatty so beware.

Specifically for this location, they always seem to have good customer service, one of their redeeming factors. Their wait staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and professional. They're always quick no matter how busy they are. The hostesses are always nice, despite the chaos of large crowds. There is usually a wait varying from 5-90 minutes during busy hours. I went there today and the wait was maybe 5 minutes. When my name was called, I started walking up but saw someone else walk up to the hostess desk and claim herself as Sylvia. This other person may have heard wrong and something completely innocent happened, but when I finally made my way there and told them I was Sylvia, they apologized profusely for what had happened and seated me immediately. It wasn't their fault this happened, but I still appreciated the way the handled it."}

So when I asked her where she wanted to go for her Birthday , this is where she choose. Now we had not been to this location ever. 
Just some of the others around the Country and Hawaii.
Plus it had been well over a year since we had even visited Roy's, but they were the shiny star of my memories. Every thing you could ever want in a Seafood Restaurant.

When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, I told them it was Rachel's B day. When we arrived they told her Happy Birthday and gave us special menus on the inside it said Happy Birthday Rachel and the date. Wow, I thought that was pretty amazing.

Our server was an amazing girl that thought of every thing. The manager even came over to wish my daughter a Happy Birthday.
All the drinks were usurper! The food was truly amazing!! We had the Canoe for two for starters, even though there were 3 of us, there was more than enough. Plus, Mario got a salad which he said was delish!

We had the Butterfish , the Mahi Mahi , and the Old School combo,which was 4 fish dishes on one large dish.Mario had that one. Every thing was perfect, I mean everything. 
For dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle and they even treated the Birthday girl to a wonderful Creme Burle, with fresh fruit and chocolate cake. They even put Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce on her dessert plate.
Yes it is expensive but, at least you are getting what you pay for . 
Great service and Great food."}

This place is absolutely WONDERFUL! In celebration of my birthday a group of friends and I went to Roy's. A friend made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we were immediately seated. I opened my menu and to my surprise inside the menu was a flyer that was personalized for all the guest in my party wishing me, yours truly, a happy birthday. It was a nice keepsake. At the end of our meal we were also photographed and given the picture in a nice frame to forever capture the event....Anywho...on to the food.

For an appetizer I enjoyed the lobster roll. It was good. The seafood fresh and the presentation awesome.  My girlfriends had salt and pepper calamari and the other had szechuan baby back ribs (these were heavenly).

Main entrees we enjoyed the misoyaki butterfish and it was succulent, moist and melt in your mouth fabulous. My other friend enjoyed the rack of lamb and judging by the bones left on her plate they must have been pretty darn good as well. 

Dessert. I had the pineapple upside down cake and my friends had the apple crisp tart and the molten hot chocolate cake...orgasmic...lol

Oh, I forgot the sangria it was Wonderful as well...

This place is awesome. However, if you are looking for a $20 meal this is not your place. Be prepared to spend a little more than average here. It is worth every penny. Appetizers are roughly between $10 -$20. My dinner entree alone was $28.95 and desserts average what appetizers cost. Bring your credit card...lol 

I hear happy hour is wonderful with wonderful prices. I will be returning very, very soon."}

Every meal has been really, really, really good...I dream of them...lol

So this review is almost a review in comparison with other Roy's, rather than a review on the restaurant itself. The food was great compared to other restaurants, but not as good as the food at Roy's in the two locations in Hawaii (and we ordered the same dishes as I've had in Hawaii). Also, I saw later that the amount with tip charged on my credit card was $2 more than what we had actually signed for....so that was not cool :( Definitely one star deducted for that.

Entrees: 

Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi - Well prepared, but seemed under-seasoned than other Roy's preparation

Braised Short Ribs of Beef - This was on-par with Hawaii Roy's location preparation. My husband ordered this and I was trying to swipe as many bites as I could lol I was enjoying it more than my mahi mahi.

Dessert:

My husband ordered the cheesecake, which I actually hadn't had in Hawaii -- it was SO good! It was very rich, creamy and the crust was perfect. I ordered my absolute favorite -- the chocolate molten cake with the raspberry drizzle...YUM! And it was delicious as always, but they were skimpy with the raspberry drizzle here and the cake was a bit chewier than Hawaii's preparation. 

All in all, it was a great meal compared to other restaurants in general. But compared to other Roy's locations, the food was just okay (plus not cool for the tipping 'mistake')."}

I was persuaded to try it again for my husband's birthday. We attended the Wagner's Wine roll out. This was a special event with 5 courses and 5 different wines. We had a wonderful time. The service was spot on. All the Wagner wine was amazing. Wagner had both red and white wines. I would buy this wine at Roy's or Total Wines. The food was perfectly paired with the wine. Roy's even substituted out one item due to a food allergy for me. This event has renewed my faith in Roy's! I would recommended attending any wine event or having a wonderful evening out at Roy's!"}

The Pastrami is great too.  My favorite sandwich is their Reuben with Pastrami (you can get it with corned beef).  Their potato pancakes are served with applesauce and sour cream.  I adore them.  And don't get me started on their fantastic Jewish Sliders.

Now the negative the fillet was awful just disgusting. It was way too much pepper there was no flavor only pepper. I highly recommend staying away from the fillet mignon.

Some of us had this issue (4) of us out of the large party. We weren't going to complain because we have all worked service and it was not the waiters fault. But once something was said an incompetent old woman came to the table to let us know it was suppose to taste like butter.

We discovered there was one in Chandler and it just happened to be extremely close to our hotel.  We went for Happy Hour and had some drinks and appetizers.  My wife loves the pineapple martini, and I had the Kona longboard, which is what I had at the Roy's in Hawaii.  An authentic Hawaiian beer!  The spiced pork ribs are awesome and tastes great!  The spring rolls were good too, but not as good as the ribs.  I ordered the butterfish, which is a great, tender, mild fish.  My wife had the ahi tuna entree.  Both were delicious, properly cooked and tasted fresh (although I don't know if it was).  The sauce on the butterfish was great, although there was a hint of wasabi, which I didn't really like.  It also came with black rice, which tastes almost like risotto with a sweetness.  I didn't care for he rice too much, but my wife liked it.  And, of course, we got dessert.  Chocolate soufflé for me, and the pineapple upside down cake for the wife.  Both were delicious, but you need to order it early because it takes 20 minutes to make.

We need to give kudos to our bartenders, Justin and Samantha.  We sat at the bar and they served us dinner and drinks all night.  They were very attentive to our needs and chatted us up a bit when things were slow.  Truly professional, friendly, and both made great pineapple martinis.  Loved the drinks, food, and the overall experience!!"}

First off the atmosphere in here is nice but very dim and hard on the eyes. 
Ok now the food. I had the Crispy Cuban Egg Rolls. They were delicious, at the Scottsdale chain(previously went and had the sampler). 
The ham and Swiss is perfectly melted onto the wrap to make it melt in your mouth. The mustard sauce is the proverbial cherry on top. 4.5 stars. 

For dessert I got the chocolate mousse cheesecake. One word, delicious. It is one of the best cakes I've had here. The presentation of it makes it look like a 5 star restaurant, taste included. Biting in, the vanilla mascarpone is the first thing that hits the taste buds. It is creamy and rich yet not overwhelming. Next, getting into the chocolate. The mousse was delicious and not too overwhelming. Overall the flavors blend together to create a perfect dessert. 5 stars. 

My only trouble here was the service. If I didn't say when, then why did you stop with the mozzarella? 

Overall 3/5."}

So...the boyfriend and I headed out to this very posh place. The waiters were very attentive...like putting a napkin on my lap, refreshing water practically after each sip, walking me to the restroom, clearing plates as soon as we were done...like that. So we had lobster pot-stickers to start out with. It had a butter demi-glaze sauce (I believe) that had a spice to it and i don't think I can have any pot-sticker ever again that will be as good as this. These were so good! Second course I got filet mignon and the boyfriend had short ribs. Both excellent, cooked to perfection and came with buttery mashed potatoes, brocolini and small carrots. Seriously...the potatoes were amazing. I kept dipping the veggies in it to enhance their flavor. 
Dessert choice was a chocolate souffle for me and a cheesecake with blueberry sauce for the boyfriend. All in all, best service, best food and wonderful experience that I've ever had.
Need to try this place again....the pot-stickers alone make it worth while."}

I very much enjoy their deli sandwiches, and have yet to find anything that can come close to the options, price and most importantly, the taste.  The Corned Beef, it's lean, well prepared, piled high...
On the marble rye with Muenster cheese and mustard 
-for me, it's a dream date.
And before I forget, a half sandwich is more than enough.  The server told me it's like six ounces of meat on the half sandwich.
Come on, meat, bread, an accompaniment (coleslaw, potato salad, French fries, other).  How much more so ya need?!
The whole sandwich is eight ounces piled high on your choice of bread or roll.  Oh, and before I forget, they have a few gluten free options too.
Something to consider if you're in the GF train like so many are and more of us are learning we probably should be too.
But anyway, their deli sandwiches are probably the BEST in the Valley.  Heck, maybe even the entire state of Arizona ftm."}

It was mine and my wife's 4 year anniversary and so I made reservations here for 7pm on Friday. When we arrived, we were greeted by multiple friendly employees and I believe even the manager, who was walking around to make sure things were running smoothly, it seemed! We got walked to our table and were soon greeted by our server Eric. He was so kind, and so friendly. He made sure we were taken care of!

We started off with the Sunshine sushi and omg! Tempora, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, rice cooked to perfection, YUM! It was the best sushi roll I've ever had in Arizona! My entree was the shrimp and fried rice and my wife got the braised beef. Each dish was incredibly delicious. The shrimp was fresh, juicy, and plump. The beef melted in your mouth! The entrees did not disappoint! Last, the dessert was pineapple upside down cake and oh my... Let's just say that was gone QUICK!  

Overall, if you have a nice occasion and want to eat well, choose Roy's. It was one of the most pleasant experiences we've had and we can confidently say we'll be back! 

A side note though, it is more on the fancy side so I was surprised to see people in T-shirts and flip flops.... Cmon people! It's fun to get dressed up every once in a while. Let's keep it classy!"}

If I'm craving something sweet, I get the stuffed French Toast which is stuffed with whipped cream cheese and strawberry jam then deep fried. Unmatched! If I want something salty, I order the corn beef hash with two eggs. It's satisfying and delicious.
For lunch/dinner I can go for the Borenstein burger with bacon and sweet potato fries or the traditional Jewish sliders. Matzo ball soup is great, too. For dessert, I'll go for their 7 layer cake, brownie, or black and white cookie. Nom nom nom."}

While I waited for my food I took it all in.  I love the NY vibe, the walls with pictures of NY and all the great things about NY.  It made me want to get on a plane and take another trip to NY!!!

At 9:03 an older Hispanic lady bussing tables came to take our plates.

She slapped her hand on the table in some sort of angry protest at us too.  We weren't even the last people and we're still just waiting for our check.

I was a little shocked at our treatment. The waiter walked up just a minute behind her and was just as good as ever. As we left I spoke to a woman I thought was the manager and told her that if coming in at 8:30 was a problem they shouldn't  have let us know at the time and that it was fine.

The portions are huge, and the service is *usually* decent.

We went last night (Tuesday) after a rough day, neither my husband or I felt like cooking. Figuring this was our best option since it would have something for everyone, we went late hoping we'd miss any crowds. But its a Tuesday night in late May, why on earth where there be a wait?

Sure enough, we got there and it was a 5 minute wait. No big deal, even though we waited more like 10-15 minutes...and that is no fun with a hungry 4 year old, when its after 8pm. Probably our mistake as parents thinking we would get a quick meal, and be in and out. 

We were seated and it took another 10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. Our waiter did apologize for the wait but it was a very half-assed apology. Either be sincere or don't bother mentioning it. We also ordered our food since we had time to look over the menu. Drinks were slow getting out, another 10 minutes. Food was also slow getting out. We were probably here 40 minutes before we got our food. It was busy, but not that busy. 

Our waiter was nice but did not ask me once if I needed a refill on my drink, my glass was clearly empty. He did offer my husband another beer though and promptly brought that out. 

The service here just sucked, and its gotten worse every time we've come. I know losing us as customers won't make or break you, but we really are done with this location. If you must go to Cheesecake, opt for the Biltmore location!"}

Excellent sushi, pot stickers, ribs- yum! Roy's stands out as one of the best east valley restaurants and last night was no exception. Been here a few times and have never been let down.

There are a few salad dishes in their small bites or skinny menu that I have been wanting to try, so I ordered the fresh vegetables salad. When I received the order I was disappointed. There were no beets to be found. At first I doubted myself... thinking maybe I ordered something that doesn't have beets. So I didn't tell my server. I should ask a question but I didn't want to be a pain. The salad honestly was very plain. A lot of lettuce that I don't care for... I should have ordered the beets with Arugula. Oh well maybe the skinny menu is to blame. Hubby ordered the blackened shrimp on the other hand it was fantastic dish.

I do enjoyed my iced tea. Who should have thought mint leaves can turn an ordinary ice tea into refreshing and magical!?"}

Definitely not inexpensive and quite expensive for us.  We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary here this year.  I made a reservation online, very easy.  Saw their menu online, so I knew our dinner was going to be over $100 for the two of us.

Neither of us drink alcohol, so that greatly tamed our bill.  The ambiance is romantic and tropical, but noisy and fairly dark.  The staff there from the time we entered all treated us like royalty as well as the others.

They had a note for us in our menus helping us celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We really loved the personal touch.  Our water glasses were always refilled.  The food was scrumptious.  

For appetizers, I can't remember the exact names, we had some pork spare ribs (this was a lot and I expected a couple spare ribs but it almost seemed like 1/3 or 1/2 a slab of baby back ribs.  Very tender and cooked perfectly.  My husband LOVES ribs.  I ordered some type of beef spring rolls, but spring rolls for the Asian is not deep fried, rather they use rice paper.  They deep fried these "spring" rolls.  These were delicious, but the most expensive eggrolls I've ever eaten.  Still that's fine.  I think appetizers price can go from $7-$15.

Every plate that came out from the appetizers to the dessert were all beautifully decorated.  Different people other than the main server checked on us.  They made it very special for us.

For dinner, my husband ordered some stuff pork tenderloin stuff with pecans and dates with a bacon risotto.  We've never eaten not fully cooked pork before.  We were uncomfortable with eating medium rare pork and sent that dish back to the kitchen to have it cooked more.  They were fine and didn't treat us as if we were ruining the chef's creation.  My husband liked the pork well done and not pink.  This was probably in the realm of $28-30.

I had some butterfish, which is a black Alaskan cod that just melted in your mouth.  The sauce had a sweet taste to it and it was atop baby bok choy and a black rice.  Very yummy.  I think this was in the realm of $35+.

I didn't expect the portions of food to be so big.  I was thinking the portions would be more along the lines of French food, so by the time dinner was done, we were stuffed and had to take home some food.

This was more than enough food and we didn't have any room for dessert, but they surprised us with this beautiful plate of desserts with "Happy Anniversary" written on it with a trio of desserts on it - creme brulee, some chocolate thing and something else.  All very yummy.  Though we were stuff, we ate this and this really put us over the edge.

We gave a really big tip because they gave us way, way more than we expected with top notch service.  This won't be a restaurant we frequent due to price, but it is definitely worth doing on a special occasion.  

This was a wonderful date.  All the food was yummy.  Excellent service and worth every penny."}

Here is the story of a horrific lunch experience. We decided to eat at Chompie's for a graduation luncheon to celebrate with family and friends... What started out being fine with our drinks served transformed into a nightmare. 

Food was served...by the owner (did not know that at the time) I ordered their signature meal- the jewish sliders, others ordered the coney hotdog, potato pancakes, salmon bagel. Food looked fine but looks can be very deceiving. 

Everyone had at least a bite taken when I looked up and saw the mortified face of the person seated across from me. That look only means one thing...something terrible is wrong and it's on you! I looked down to find the largest cockroach I have ever seen crawling on my left shoulder!  

As a side note, I am not afraid of bugs... However a cockroach is far more then just a simple bug, and the size of this cockroach would give the heebie-jeebies to the toughest men.

Naturally, I swatted at it... Making it land close to the person I was sitting next towe both in reaction jumped out of the booth we were in ... The man that delivered our food just moments ago was there in an instant & to our shock grabbed this beast of a rodent by his bare hands.  My only thought is that the next table he served got a little extra on their plate! 

Not even having one full bite of my lunch the only thing the manager did was say he would take care of the meal... WHAT MEAL? We didn't get to get before our unwanted guest arrived, in my view absolutely nothing was done to rectify this absolutely grotesque situation.

This was no ordinary lunch, this was a lunch to celebrate a great achievement and enjoy each other company.  Now forever will these graduates will remember their graduation lunch with a huge disgusting cockroach oppose a celebration of their success as to what the lunch was intended for. 

Not only did Chompie's completely embarrass me, it also completely mortified me. 

I want you to image a cockroach the size of your thumb crawling on you right after you bight into your food... How would you react and feel?   Then add a special celebration to the situation.  I am completely mortified."}

The steak diane usually has a nice sauce also...NADA. The steak was completely dry. We also ordered the samosas appetizer and lemoncello cake for dessert...they were both delicious, as expected. Hence the 2-stars. Another HUGE thumbs down - no bread!

My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband had made the reservation online.  It was great because it asked if we had any allergies, so he could let them know ahead of time that I'm gluten free.  They also asked if we were celebrating anything special, so he let them know if was our anniversary.

As soon as we walked in the door and let them know our names, they immediately wished us a happy anniversary, and grabbed me a gluten free menu.  When we got to the table we found they had created personal menu inserts, congratulating us on our anniversay, brought us a complimentary glass of champagne, and let us know the chef had prepared for us an anniversary tasting menu (gluten free for me) if we wanted to go off the regular menu.  It was truly memorable.

The tasting menu was amazing, simply amazing.  The started with a shrimp & scallop appetizer.  Scallops are one of my favorite things, and this was cooked perfectly.  They brought us a small plate of steamed edemame, and the seasoning was super delicious.  The next course was ahi tuna poke.  It was a little spicy, but the cucumber and avacado they served it with toned it down and made it perfectly balanced.  We were then served butterfish bites.  I have to say, that is one of the best things I've ever eaten, hands down.  It served with a ginger glaze and a little wasabi.  I could have eaten a whole portion of that.  We also had a small salad of arugala, dates, panchetta, and a white balsamic dressing.  It was so light and refreshing.  All the flavors just exploded in your mouth.  The main course consisted of steak and a half lobster.  The lobster was buttery, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The steak was served with a red wine ver blanc.  The official dessert was their chocolate souffle, but as a surprise they served a mini dessert for us with chocolate cake and creme brulee.  They decorated the plate to say Happy Anniversay and took a complimentary picture for us.  Those mini desserts were divine.  Then came the souffle, I'd been eager to try it for about a week.  It did not disappoint.  The chocolate was rich, the inside was gooey chocolate goodness.

Between the experience of all the managers & our server catering to our anniversary and the amazing food, my husband and I are guaranteed to become regulars here."}

If you haven't tried Roy's before I suggest the many sampler plates, you will find a favorite! Mine is the Miso Butterfish, melts like butter in your mouth, with a flavor experience you have never had before! Less fusiony dish-The filet mignon is to die for! Service was sketchy, I had to refill my own sparkling water twice! We waited a long time  without a check in from our waiter in between orders!!! Hence, the 4 stars, not 5! Dishes were on small side so you will need an appetizer and dessert to be "full." I would eat here again, especially if I'm not buying, it's a little pricey but great experience!"}

The girl bussing our table was exceptional... filling water and clearing plates quickly. She is ready for promotion....she was probably the most polite  employee there.  Even the manager refilled our drinks once.  Everything was served quickly and with a smile.  The food was excellent!  I highly recommend the short ribs. My husband marvels at the creamy texture of the mashed potatoes. The only issue was that we had to wait for our table 15 minutes after our reservation time. A couple arrived after us but were seated before us. Even if their reservation was the same time or before ours, it's my opinion that you should seat waiting/on time people first. We will be back."}

Normally we go to the Scottsdale location which I will say is considerably better than the Chandler location. The Chandler location appears old, dated, dirty and not to mention service slow. It took a bit of time for the server to even come to our table with menus and then take our order. I think we were the forgotten child while waiting and waiting for our food, while it seemed other tables were getting their food before us even after they sat after us.

Missing my craving for Chopped liver, I ordered the appetizer portion that came with Bagel Chips and a slice of Onion. My friend ordered the Pastrami on Rye which was good, though the sandwich size was not piled high like the Scottsdale location serves. My Chopped Liver was a little too sweet for my taste which I never had that in the Scottsdale either.

Chandler location, service slow, kitchen slow, food OK, atmosphere: old, and dirty. Go to the Scottsdale location, I'm a 4 Star fan there!"}

We made reservations in advance and it was nice to be greeted with a "Happy Anniversary," along with a menu message.

Our waitress was very good. She answered our menu questions and obviously knew the menu.  We started with the lobster potstickers (recommend).  I ordered a Hawaiian martini; husband ordered the Maui Mule.  Wished I had ordered the Maui Mule.

Salads were excellent, perfect sizes and tasty.  I ordered the fish trio, which was just the right-sized portions of the butterfish (highly recommend), mahi mahi (tasty) and salmon (so-so).  Husband ordered the swordfish (so-so) and wished he had ordered the butterfish. 

We did order the soufflé; however, if we'd known we'd be getting a complimentary brownie for our anniversary (delish!), we'd probably wouldn't have ordered the soufflé.

All in all, a nice dining experience.  Our feedback:

Music: The music was too loud and not very classy.  Had a Denny's Restaurant feel.  Was expecting a classier décor.

Servers: As soon as we finished a final bite, the servers swooped in and removed our plates, making us feel rushed.  They even swooped away our desert plates and utensils, leaving us to use our fingers for the complimentary brownies. Not cool.

Food and cocktails were tasty. We'd go back."}

We've been here probably 40 times in the past 4 years.  What's up with not giving them some Yelp love?  

I think 37 of those times were for breakfast and we have worked our way through most of the breakfast menu.  Love the huge omelets and fried potatoes that come on the side.  Never had a bad meal here.

Most recently Mr. M and I had had a very long day of work and house hunting and were exhausted.  I suggested Chompie's because I was craving some soup.  I had the matzo ball soup and he had the clam chowder.  Both were delicious and we were passing those bowls back and forth.  I ended up keeping the chowder and taking a large bowl of it home for Saturday.  They only have the chowder on Fridays, but they have 5 or 6 other kinds of soup every day.  

I also had the Jewish sliders and he had a half sandwich with hard salami and Havarti on sourdough.  I can't even type hard salami without getting the giggles, let alone say it.  Their famous sliders were excellent as always and Mr. M's sandwich accompanied the soup perfectly.  

The bakery counter is amazing and full of all kinds of goodies.  I try not to look at it when I'm in there or I will get sucked in.  

Only once out of all the times we've been here have we had bad service and that was an older broad working the bakery counter who was ignoring everyone so she could chat with her friend about how things used to be in New York.  blah blah blah.  She needed a reminder that she was at work, BUT I haven't seen her in a long, long time so maybe she moved back East.  Usually the employees are very friendly and efficient.  I would say Chompie's is my #1 breakfast choice and then the Biscuits on Dobson.  Excellent food every time!"}

Not knowing how they serve it, we just ate it anyway. Also to add the Jewish rye for the hot (so called) hot pastrami was falling apart. Not more than 15 minutes of leaving the place my stomach started to hurt and I had to use the restroom. Safe to say we will not be dining here or other locations anymore. It's weird how one location can ruin it for all the other locations."}

I would definitely not return to this restaurant; although based on other reviews I might try one in a different city.  The service was not good.  We were seated by a very inexperienced host and our main waitress seemed to be very new and moved from "stalking us" to ignoring us for long periods of time.  In addition, the food was good but not up to par with the prices.  I had the seafood sampler and the lobster was on par to something you would get at Red Lobster (it was small and overcooked)-seriously.  My husband had the seafood quad (not on the menu) and said all of the fish (except the tuna which was served raw) was overcooked.  We did enjoy the beef spring rolls; although the presentation was really odd...they looked like three soggy cigars when they came out; but they were delicious.  Finally we had the chocolate desert that you have to order ahead...I had one bite; it was not worth the calories.  We did enjoy the wine...Fess Parker Ashley but we found by the second bottle that we needed to move it to the other side of the booth because our waitress kept over pouring our glasses...it was crazy. 

Anyway, hope you have a better experience."}

I wanted to go somewhere close to our house but didn't feel like steak.  A lot of independent restaurants are closed on Mondays so that is why we had to do a chain. I am not sure if that also explains why this place was so packed.  It may also be due to the fact that they have a great prix-fix deal on Mondays where you can get almost any appetizer, entree, and dessert combination for just $37.  Not a bad deal since we both left the place absolutely stuffed to the brim and we are both big eaters.

Overall, the service at this place is really great and the food is prepared well.  I really enjoyed our visit there but I would never really become a regular since for some reason I am just not a fan of their menu.  I love seafood, but most of their dishes come with a ton of sauce or crusted or wrapped in something.  I think if you have fresh, high quality seafood then you should just let the flavor of the food shine through.  That's just me.  I did really like the taste of the wasabi sauce on my butter fish entree. I highly recommend ordering that dish. And also, their cocktails. I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced.

I think Roy's is a great option for happy hour when you are looking for something a little higher class than your basic patio bar or for dinner when you feel like a taste of the islands. But I can't honestly say I'm a fan, hence the three stars."}

My lunch arrived in nine mins, with most of the menu pre- or par-cooked. That said, my fries were still crispy/fluffy. My patty melt was over cooked but still juicy. I like the grilled onion slice inside.

Service: staffs are friendly and approachable. This is my first time here and they walked me through the menu as well as dessert. 

Food: I was only here for desserts since we already had dinner before coming here. We ordered a mango flavor drink and it was decent. The huge chuck of ice makes it hard for me to drink through the small straw. We also ordered a cheese cake as well as Brooklyn 7 layer of chocolate cake. If you like the taste of sugar (I mean, nothing but sugar), you might like these dessert. Not only I do not taste the chocolate, I can't really taste the flavor of cakes neither. 

Rating: I will probably come back to try their sandwiches. But definitely will not order their dessert again."}

The Mac and cheese had a gritty texture that was quite gross.

The fish itself was Amber Jack and quite overdone.

if you are Polish and see that they have pierogi on the menu, don't get your hopes up--this is a Jewish Deli and the pierogis are overdone and dry and don't taste at all like you would expect.   Same if you are Mexican and get the Albondigas soup. Not dry, but definitely an odd flavor.

They do have some sort of a "boot camp" breakfast menu. I haven't tried anything on there at all.   The lemon bars were good the first time we went, but not the 2nd; I was told it's hit or miss with the taste of those.

It's a cute restaurant chain in AZ with 4, I think, locations, and a NY Deli-type theme. There is graffiti, license plates from NY, sports pix, etc all over the walls as decoration.

Mostly we haven't gotten good service here. It's been a pleasant surprise when we have.  And if you go on a Sunday around noonish, they don't take reservations or call-ahead seating and it's normally a 25 to 40 min wait.  And if you have kids? The waitresses mostly forget to bring the cookie they get as part of their meal at the end. I didn't know about it and was surprised, and asked what was that for? She said, it's part of the kids' meal. 

oh, and if you go to the Tempe location? the manager not only doesn't care, but he can't read the handwriting of the ppl taking your name down, calls the wrong name, passes you up, and then when you ask why it's been longer than they said and ppl who came in after you are getting seated, he gives you an attitide and said he called your name repeatedly. We were sitting right there--we went nowhere, including to their bathroom, while we waited.  Not sure if he whispered my name into someone else's ear, but I'm not deaf. I heard everyone else's name being called, including "Jake" when there was no Jake. I'm pretty sure I was Jake that day, but they denied it and said there was definitely a Jake. Funny I saw no one answering them when they repeatedly called Jake and moved on to the next person on the list.  And it's really a tight squeeze in the Tempe location; the tables/booths seem a bit too close together, especially if you have a baby and need to use a high-chair."}

I went here this morning with the BF and a couple of our friends for breakfast. So the coffee here is just as atrocious as at the other locations.... it is so bad. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee with only half a creamer, but here I put in two creamers and it still tasted terrible. I tried something new today and got the Cabo skillet. It has home fries with bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, green chilis, new mexican chili, tomatoes, and scallions in it. Then they melt jalapeno jack cheese on top and put some slices of avocado on that AND it has two eggs on top which I ordered over medium. This thing was good. I mean super good! It was just the right amount of spicy, it did not need any salt and pepper (and I love salt and pepper on my eggs) and it did not need ketchup. It was pretty wonderful and huge, I couldn't eat it all. This is definitely the best thing I've ever had at chompies. Oh, so it comes with a bagel on the side, and mine was a little burnt.... but normally the bagels here are pretty good. The BF got biscuits and gravy and thought they were a bit too sweet, but I don't know about that because I don't like biscuits and gravy and didn't taste it. Our friends got a different skillet and an omelet of sorts, and both said it was really good.   Overall, this was a Chompie's win, especially in comparison to the last few times I've been and it wasn't so good. 

Also, bring back the Lovie's difficult decision! That was the best thing ever! (a piece of kugel, a latke, a blintz, and a cup of matzo ball soup.... all of my faves on one plate.)"}

I went there last night and there was a great improvement over my previous visit.  We were seated promptly as the restaurant was about half full.  A waitress came over fairly quickly to take our drink orders.  We both had their "Celebrate Fall" special, consisting of an appetizer of breaded prawns on a bed of cabbage leaves and a great salsa.  Really delicious.  The crusted salmon was done according to order, i.e., well done for me and medium for my wife.  It was served on a bed of baby vegetables and was quite yummy, no complaints there.  I also ordered a wedge salad as my wife and I were both extremely hungry, pretty much having not eaten lunch.  The bread pudding for dessert was nothing short of outstanding, served with a garnish of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream.  So, all in all, the food was really good.

So if the food was this good, why the three stars.  Well, for me to give 5 stars I would have to visit a restaurant several times and have a predominantly 5 star experience each time, so I'm no quite there with Roy's yet.  As I pointed out in previous reviews the food and service seems to be spotty, so I'll have to keep an open mind and return a few times to see if their game has truly been upped or if last night was a fluke.  Sorry to be so pessimistic, but my experience has made me very wary, considering that Roy's is not bottom of the barrel pricewise.  Four stars might have been appropriate, but there were a couple of missteps.  

To start with, for some reason Roy's is a bit slow on the drinks front, which is odd as most restaurants make a large portion of their profit from the sale of alcohol.  That should prompt the bartenders and waiting staff to get those first drinks out ASAP.  Also, because we were so hungry I asked if we could order some bread.  The waitress told me they don't offer bread, but we could have some complimentary edamame if we wished.  I gladly accepted the offer, but the edamame never materialized.  I was also never asked if I wanted another beer - same comment about alcohol sales.  I don't get it.  (As an aside, Roy's has no beer on draught, just bottles, but I shall not hold that against them in the review.  Again, beer on tap may carry a higher margin than the bottled variety, so why not sell it that way?  I'll let you decide if this is a plus or a minus.  I do find it odd, though, since most good restaurants do offer tap beer and in larger quantities than a 12 oz. bottle provides.)  Lastly, I waited a full 15 minutes to get my bill.  I was basically ignored by the waitress and had to get another staffer to lasso her and get my bill ready.  Oh, yes, during our meal, a gentleman, who I assume to be the manager, did come to our, and everyone else's, table very briefly to inquire as to the quality of our experience.  I don't mean to be rude or mean, but his approach was more perfunctory than warm or cordial, but at least he made the rounds.

All in all I enjoyed the experience, but since 5 stars are out for the moment and since there were still a few hiccups with service, the best I can do at the moment is 3 stars.  I shall go back since the food was so good last night and the service has improved, but still not as good as it should be.   I would love to give this shop 5 stars, so I'll give them a chance to earn it."}

Cheesecake is not a place that my husband and I would choose if we were out alone.  So aside from the occasional lunch salad while shopping or getting cheesecake to-go, we haven't been here in a long time.

My #3 son chose Cheesecake for his birthday dinner.  Items ordered included calamari (same at all chains), fried mac and cheese appetizer (delish), Chicken Maderia (sweet, tender chicken), Low-calorie chicken and asparagus (boring, but served it's purpose), 4 cheese pasta with chicken(huge portion, but again same as any chain), buffalo blaster (fried  boneless chicken wing something), kids quesadilla (over priced for tortilla and cheese), farmhouse cheese burger (good, not great).

We had 4 cheesecakes...Key lime, red velvet, apple caramel struesel, reeses peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake.  All were FANTASTIC!

The cheesecake will always be the 1 thing that keeps us coming back.  I still think everything is overpriced, but at least they are consistent. 

Service was good this time.  When we left, they were on a wait, but there were tables open everywhere.  Clearly a staffing issue, but I am sure frustrating to customers."}

I have come to the conclusion that the Cheesecake Factory needs to find out what they want to be. Do you want to be a Mexican restaurant? A steakhouse? An American grill? Clearly this mix match of food and seven menu pages worth of choices has worked for them for a long time but my belief is that you can't do something great if you try to do 100 things at one time. Too many menu items! While variety is nice, the menu is overwhelming and the chef's have way too much room for error. My food has always been just okay here but it is clear to me why. I do love the cheesecake. It is my favorite dessert so that is of course ultimately why I come here. I generally decide to make a meal of it when I do come here and often just wonder why I didn't just go to The Keg across the street. Why have a mediocre steak when you could have an amazing one? For now I think I will just stick to The Cheesecake Factory's namesake. How did a dessert restaurant turn into a free for all of tex mex, steaks, burgers, pasta and seafood, oh my!"}

At the time I was planning my first visit to Hawaii, and I was specifically avoiding Oahu and making a beeline for the Big Island so the final competitions on the Big Island captured my fancy.  Roy was a major judge in the competition.

The loss of my job nearly four years ago caused a major shift in priorities for me, as in no more trips to Hawaii anytime soon. Ditto for dining on haute cuisine. 

Somehow I stumbled onto the website for Roy's and learned about the Aloha menu.  With a five dollar price ceiling for drinks and food, I reckoned I could once again sample food that was the culinary equivalent of transcendence without feeling guilty about the expenditure afterwards.
So, I cajoled my meat and potatoes Midwestern beau into taking me to Roy's for an early light meal and cocktails.

From the moment we walked in the door, everything was perfect and professional- very professional. I should know, once upon a time I made my living in haute cuisine restaurants. I've always said it's easy to find great food for a commensurate price, the trick is getting great food without a hefty pricetag. Aloha hour at Roy's affords a person such as myself the opportunity to experience innovative cuisine and cocktails without forfeiting a necessity of life such as electricity for a month.

Getting back to the staff, we were greeted and treated as if we had arrived in a limo instead of a Tundra. Once seated in the bar for Aloha hour we were not subjected to thinly veiled contempt from the server who realized that the tab was not going to merit the same gratuity as a several course meal.  The hostess, our server, and the manager on duty were  all extremely cordial, polite and provided seamless service and even better food.  

The original hawaiian martini I ordered was prepared with top shelf liquors, not cheap substitutes to reflect the reduced price.

We loved the salt and pepper calamari, Waygu sliders, potstickers, and the sushi rolls with a spin.  For a fraction of the price of the average degustation menu we sampled the gamut of appetizers and several drinks- well, I had several drinks, not the driver.  As for ambiance, we were seated at a banquette adjacent to a very large marine fish aquarium.  The atmosphere was subdued, urbane, comfortable and the staff was attentive, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Since we were on a date at the time, the server offered to take our photo. It was presented to us in a paper frame shortly afterward.  That is a ready indicator of the staff's desire to go above and beyond percentage-motivated tasks for guests.  

Kudos to Roy for bringing the true spirit of Aloha to the mainland along with his unique fushion cusine in a sophisticated atmosphere that reflects warmth and the highest level of professional service for guests regardless of the bottom line at the end of the meal."}

My dad says this is the must go place for the battered fish tacos, he thinks they are the best he has tried in AZ.

They even had a little Happy Anniversary card on the table and gave us a free desert (Key Lime) with it written on the plate.  It was awesome by the way.  We ordered the canoe for two and the Poke Bowl along with the pineapple upside down cake and we loved it all tremendously.

I don't like the Cheesecake Factory.  I've tried it a few times, and I'm not a chain snob.  Bring me some Bertucci's and I'm happy.  But here?  No.  Just no.  I don't get it.

The food is utterly mediocre (I suppose what does one expect, from a *factory*), and personally I find the portions an affront to good taste.  They are disgusting!  It's like a trough.  Anyone who can eat a whole plate of their food in one sitting needs to get help.  It's also waaaay overpriced.  I guess you're paying for quantity, not quality?  I mean you get enough food to feed yourself for a week.

The decor is so confused and charmless.  I feel like I'm on an acid trip when I'm in there--an acid trip that's gone very, very wrong and you've forgotten that life isn't a Lewis Carroll-ian hellscape.

One extra star for good service and good cheesecake.  But overall I can definitively say I won't be back to this particularly wretched chain."}

After we were served and grabbed a slider we looked at each other in confusion because the sliders were almost cold. We flagged down the server and asked if they should be hot, she said that yes they are a warm dish and said that the food had just came up and walked away!  We waited for her to come back around and asked to please take them back and warm them up. I would have thought they would have either taken the fries or served with new "hot" fries to go along with the sandwiches. The side of coleslaw is a joke. Compared to the fruit you get for the same price. The sliders are always good, but the temperature and service, is reason for 3 stars."}

As I am from MI., I came to AZ to visit them bringing my 2 grandkids on this road trip. Of course, being the good son that he is, we all went here on our last night in town. And I wasn't disappointed.
Walking into his establishment, I was amazed at the colorful decor. Splashes of vivid color in a Hawaiian themed restaurant were beautiful. The 2-D wall art was tastefully displayed.
Upon being seated, our wait person, Anthony, was informative and gracious beyond reproach. From the 1st glass of water until our last bite of dessert, Anthony made our dining experience over the top.
We began with calamari. OMG !! Melt in your mouth tender & battered to perfection. Piled high bite size pieces instead of rings.
I had the trio which consisted of Butter Fish, Ahi Tuna & grilled Salmon. Each fish was drizzled with a different sauce which complimented each individual fish. To die for is an understatement. The presentation of each of our separate entrees was nothing but classy.
After dinner, Anthony surprised us with their signature pineapple upside down cake & chocolate souffle. Both desserts were rich & delectable without being sweet. 
As each of us ordered something different, it would take to much time to tell you what we each had. I would just strongly suggest that you make a date to take that special person in your life to Roy's for an unforgettable dining experience. Just ask for Anthony to be your server.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
Kudos to Roy's Restaurant & its staff of professionals !!!"}

To be fair, they have a menu that could be mistaken for a small book, and it is filled with unhealthy delicious options. My friends all loved their unhealthy food and I looked longingly at them as I ate my salad.

And there is our headline. There is an ENTIRE MENU of healthy options, and I mean seriously healthy. Kale is involved, and when Kale shows up, you know healthy is about to throw down. The options included a lot of sandwiches, which didn't work for my carb-averse diet, so I requested the most obnoxious thing on the planet: a lettuce-wrapped sandwich with a side salad.

They served it, and it was what health nuts would describe as "delicious". I am working my way there, so as of now I can affirm that it was "food". Still, I was impressed with their response to the bad rap, and the many options on their healthy "Skinnylicious" menu. You can have very green meals here."}

The food is normally great.  5stars for the Matzo ball soup and for the sliders.  But seriously, where is management in this location?  Every time we walk in it's an uncomfortable welcome.  When asked, we say 2 for dinner.  And rather than a "please follow me", they grab the napkin set and a couple of menus and start walking off.  We never heard nor know to follow until they turn around, annoyed that they had to call you to follow them.  And rather than asking at the counter if you would like a table or both, you are awkwardly asking as you are standing in the middle of the dining room.  

It's VERY apparent that management has not done their staff justice in proper service training which in turn lacks in the service to your customers.  

I encourage the owners and managers to help make this place shine!  Show pride in your establishment and reflect the respect you have for it.  Be a leader and share your knowledge with your staff to set them up for success!  Right now, your not doing them any good and this reflects on you directly.  

Don't know where to start, I'd be happy to come in and show you!  This location can and should be the greatest and I'd do anything to see it shine the way it should!"}

The food is usually pretty good. The service is really hit-or-miss, but I guess that can be expected from a lot of restaurants. My dad was in town on Memorial Day and wanted a skillet, so I suggested we go to Chompie's because their food is pretty good. 

The first odd thing that happened is the hostess telling us "_____ will be your server, and he's REALLY great." We were all a bit confused by that because we'd never heard a hostess brag about the server before. Anyway. The server comes up to us and we tell him we're ready to order. He tells us that he can only take our drink order right now and he's going to take the order of the table behind us. We order our iced teas and he tells us, "Just so you know, guys, we've got a lot of people it's pretty busy here today, okay?" Despite there being empty tables around us, we went with it. Ten minutes later our drinks come out and we order the food, and again, he tells us "It's going to be a while because we're super busy, but I'll be sure to keep your drinks refilled." Sure, okay. Within 10 minutes we all had empty glasses. We watched him walk right by our table at least five times--one of the times he even bumped into me and apologized! I thought for sure that would get his attention but I guess not. Ten more minutes pass and as he walks by I try to get his attention for more tea, but I'm ignored. About forty minutes after we ordered the table behind us gets their food (the ones he had to help before taking our order). We wait fifteen minutes (still no refills) until someone else runs our food out to us, and it's ice cold. By this point we'd realized the hostess was probably playing a sick joke on us because she knew he was the worst sever ever.

Anyway, we're waiting for him to come to our table so we can pay for the drinks and leave, but he ignores us some more. He's standing at the table behind us and the guests ask how he's doing today, and he proceeds to complaint to them about how miserable he is to be working and how people are pissing him off. Then he walks right past us again and goes to the kitchen. At this point we just told the manager and left, who didn't even ask us to pay for the iced teas. I don't know why they'd let someone with such a horrible attitude even be on the floor. That experience really killed it for me and I don't think I'll be coming back."}

That meant we needed to scramble find a place for Christmas 2016 dinner.  Chompies was open and we called.  We confirmed that if we arrived before 6:30pm we would be seated.  Upon arrival at 6:10pm we were told that we would not be seated because the management had changed their minds about seating times.  We explained that we had called and were told 6:30pm to which we were told we were out of luck.  Now, typically this would have been an inconvenience but tonight we had our 89 year old grandmother with us for dinner. 

I immediately asked to speak to the manager and was visibly irritated.  A manager came out and I requested to speak to Mitch, the general manager.  Mitch came out and immediately apologized for the inconvenience, the misunderstanding and assured us that all would be handled.  The hostess staff informed us it would be approximately an hour before we would be seated, so we waited.  About 15 minutes later we were in a booth and ready to go.  

Drinks were served in a most timely fashion and dinner was fantastic!!!  It took a bit to get there bit  it was Christmas and the place was jam packed!!!  Absolutely will be back!  Mitch brought our food out and was an absolute gentleman!  We thanked him, apologized for our irritation and wished him a great holiday!  

Mitch - I'll be calling tomorrow to say thanks again, but you sir are amazing and a gentleman!  Thank you for saving Christensen Christmas dinner 2016.  Damn dogs."}

Service was monumentally terrible.  There were maybe 5 other tables of guests, so there was no valid reason, not that there ever is, for poor service.  Our waitress had the personality of a  paper sack and she may have been brand new.  Everything, from drinks to dessert was extremely slow in getting to us and some things had to be asked for twice, including a napkin that I did not have from the get go.  Food was okay, although our sesame cabbage salads had no sesame whatsoever.  It also seems that they consider ti sesame salad because the sprinkle a few sesame seed on it instead of using sesame oil in the dressing, if there was any dressing at all.  One order of fish was done properly and one was over done, both having been ordered medium.  My pork chop was very flavorful, albeit a bit dry.  I thought the panacotta dessert was great.  The restaurant manager was gracious enough to take some money off the bill for the two salads, since we had said they were disappointing.  I had been to Roy's before, once with terrible service and once with great service.  Seems to run a bit hot and cold."}

No server to be found. Upon asking of a server after being tired of waiting, we got one, who all night long was less than attentive. The only thing he did was take our order. Everything else; drink refills, food being brought out, bread, someone else did. It was as if we had 5 waiters. Our food took nearly 30 minutes. For two pastas. Which I will say, were amazing, I highly recommend the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce, it never disappoints. This location definitely needs some work though. And no, it's not that it is overly busy because it is at the mall, i've seen busier and bigger, some re training may be in order for the wait staff, or a reality check for management, since every table around us had the same problem even with different waiters/waitresses , and some even got tired of waiting for their cheesecake because they were "out".

Asked for the empty booth behind us and the hostess said that they don't have a server available for that table, due to current employee breaks.  Totally serious...it was not 5 minutes later that this idiot hostess sat a couple of 2 at this same booth that we (family of 4) could not have.  Finally, someone came to get our drink order and right away told us she is not our server but would get our drinnks.  Eventually we meet our server and first thing out of her mouth was "ready to order?".  We told of our booth incident.  She said sorry but tables are on a rotation basis.  What the hell this means, don't know or care.  She offers a booth for us, which we take and she walks off with an attitude.  We sit for close to another 10 minutes with no service.  Apparently, this booth is not her table so now we are back to waiting AGAIN.  We walk out obviously irritated over our terrible experience with Chompies and not one employee says anything to us.  We will never be back."}

It was a hefty gift card ($75) so I thought it would go a long way. Well, it barely covered our meal, which was during the time they called "brunch" that I was thinking would be like a brunch buffet. No, you had to order off a very limited menu, but the items on it were very good. Luckily they were able to accommodate hubby with a special vegetarian menu. I had a delicious mimosa (champagne and orange juice, I gather? Sorry, not a drink I'm terribly familiar with), they refilled hubby's soft drink before he even asked, I had the lobster omelette and hubby had some stir-fry dish with rice, veggies and tofu. We split a lime tart. I think it's a great, beautifully appointed place if you want to really dress up and go all spendy for a wedding anniversary or the like, but it's not exactly casual dining. Great for a once-a-year celebration spot."}

We decided to stay and eat so as I was looking through their large selectioned menu and opted not to get a bagel but pancakes instead. Not sure why, I should have stuck with just a bagel but nooooooo the fat girl wanted strawberry shortcake  pancakes instead....well nothing to brag home about. They werent bad but they werent the greatest either.

Large menu with lots of breakfast itrms and lunches, I will try this place again BUT probably stick with a bagel or breakfast item or even their case out front for a goody to take home ....There lunch menu wouldnt bring me back there.

Thanks to my server for being honest and confirming it was a glass piece. At least she was honest enough.
Another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes-there were broken glass pieces on the floor- one of the servers kicks them like he was playing soccer in his own field.  Smiles and walks by! Really?? Were they going to wait for the worst to happen! 
How does the management handle both these situations apart from bringing this to their attention? They don't!! Just ignored it!!
Had I cut my mouth or my tongue- they would have taken actions? What if I had consumed small glass pieces in my drink? Is the solution to these incidents to ignore them and console us by paying our bill? No. I'm really disappointed with them. And will always think twice before walking in there."}

This was our first time at this location, and we LOVED it!!!! We went for lunch, and were seated straight away.
We loved everything from the food to the service!
Our waiter, Tom, was awesome! Super cool, chill dude. I love when waiters are just themselves around you, no weird vibes like they're trying to play it cool or be fancy. So ask for Tom!
For the food, I have Celiacs, so I had to get GF. But man that was probably the best tasting gluten free meal I think I've ever had at a restaurant! We got the farfalle with roasted garlic, I think? And it was just amazing! You couldn't even tell it was GF! I can't express how AMAZING that was. And Tom even said that most of their pasta dishes (and burgers) can be made gluten free. Uh major bonus!
And of course I got the chocolate Godiva cheesecake (cause it's the only GF option). But man it was wonderful! Very rich though, so you gotta love that intense chocolate taste!
I just wish it were closer, as I live in North Tempe. 
But I will most certainly be coming back!!!"}

I called right before I arrived and I was told they will send somebody out immediately. 5 minutes later a customer arrives and within a minute, the attendant comes out and serves them. I immediately talk to that attendant and he says they will be right with me. Ten minutes pass and I give them a call again and they said they didn't know I was out there waiting. Fifteen minutes now and another customer pulls up behind me and is served. The waitress had no idea I was there again.

When I asked for the manager the manager came out and said there was nothing he would do to compensate me for my time. He said that it is my fault for not letting them know I was outside despite the fact that I called twice and talked to two attendants about having waited for someone to help.

I understand that mistakes happen in the service industry but to come out after 15 minutes of waiting and two different customers being served before me and have the manager tell me that I was at fault was not worth an overpriced 60 dollar cheesecake. On top of that, the cheesecake was still frozen an hour and half after I picked it up even though they told me they had left it to thaw two hours before I got there!

There is something for everyone.  LOTS of wine selections. Do not expect HEAPING plates. The portions are smaller, but I have never left even a little hungry. 

I love the Poke salad. They made the best BBQ ribs I have ever had anyplace. I did actually lick the plate because it was SO good. The sushi rolls are good sized. The pulled pork is tangy, but not to sweet. All of the fish is wonderful. You will want to came back and try it all.

It was great that they had misters, but they need to turn them down because I was getting soaked! At all the other locations I've been to, the first thing the server does it usually place a basket of bread in the center of your table and take your drink orders. No bread. I asked the server if bread was no longer complimentary and she said it wasn't, but offered to bring us out some pickles (Which she should have done in the first place, in that case). Pickles were not something that I was dying to eat as an appetizer. Next, we looked at the menu. What a jumbled mess! The selection is awesome, but they had stuffed WAY too many items on a single page. I ordered the stuffed cabbage and when it finally came out, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. It tasted way different than it did at the other location. The meat was super bland, and kind of grayish. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location."}

We never went a second without full drinks and every other extra we could possibly ask for.  (Yes ALL NINE of us...that is no small feat!!!). Our table had so many different things such as my fave, the Jewish Sliders, my husband's new favorite, (and maybe mine judging by what I stole off his plate!). the Chicken Fried Steak burger...WOW AMAZING!....there were many others the Monte Cristo, Smoked Salmon, Matzo Ball soup, potato pancakes and of course some sweet potato fries and many other amazing dishes, not to forget the endless strawberry lemonades!!!   DELICIOUS!!!  
Thank you Linsey!!!  Thank you Chompies!!!
Oh yea, and Thank you again Linsey for helping my mother-in-law get set up with the rewards app on her phone, that was super sweet of you!!!

Since we have family in town, we decided to take them here the other night so they could sample all of the awesome. 

We went for dinner around 6:30p on Saturday night and I was moderately surprised to see that they were quite slow for the time of night. We were promptly seated by a very bubbly hostess. Our waiter came by shortly later and was equally friendly. There were 3 adults and 2 children in our party and we split 2 meals between us. The meals are HUGE!!! We ended up with leftover after sharing the 2 meals 5 ways!!!

We ordered the Jewish sliders and the Monte Cristo Sandwich. Both were very good, but the Jewish sliders were REALLY something special. My husband is Jewish and was raised eating his grandmothers authentic Jewish cooking. He said that the sliders taste just like something his grandmother used to make.

Our server was very responsive and anticipated refills that were needed. The meal seemed to take longer to make then I anticipated considering how slow they were. Since we didn't have anything else going on we didn't mind the wait. 

Bottom line:

* Food is awesome and authentic to NY and the Jewish style cooking.
* Not a great place to go if you are in a rush


We will definitely be returning to Chompies for more of their Jewish sliders in the near future!"}

I haven't walked out of any restaurant, after paying, more dissatisfied than this place in over twenty years. I'd rather roll the dice on getting cyclosporaisis from a McDonalds salad than ever eat here again.

Wife got a seafood sampler plate with butterfish (favorite), salmon (close second) and Mahi Mahi (good but a little too fishy-compared to the others). 

Finished with a blood orange cake (shoulda done the souffle, live and learn) which was a little sweeter than I like, but still very enjoyable.

I've been coming about once or twice a month for the past 5 years, give or take. My recommendation- go ahead, take the time and read the menu. This place is known for their novel-length selection with literally hundreds of items and unique bites. Consistently mediocre service, great ambiance, and they always have exactly what you're in the mood for from sushi to barbecue. Oh, and cheesecake. Yeah that's pretty much the whole reason I love this place. 

Between friends and family, I've seen and tried a huge amount but my go-to is a dinner-sized appetizer with a few substitutions. It's called the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I substitute the noodles with avocado and the chicken with salmon. It's super healthy, the dips are to die for, and lasts me at least two meals. Some of my other favorites, and slightly less healthy options, include the Mac And Cheese burger and Chicken Bellagio (ask for extra sauce). You really can't go wrong with those. My mom swears by the kale quinoa salad and proclaims it's the best kale she's ever had. 

Okay as for the cheesecakes, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake is my newest favorite- replacing my previous favorite of Ultimate Red Velvet. It was seasonal this fall (2015) and became a part of the menu due to popular demand. I'm SO glad. I absolutely love cheesecake and have one each time I go. Other favorites include the White Chocolate and Reece's Peanut Butter Cup."}

We opted for the Jewish sliders and the New Jersey sliders. Each plate came with three sandwiches and we each managed two and took the remaining sandwiches home. We didn't have any of the corned beef but tried a sample and it was amazing! We ultimately opted for the pastrami, which was also excellent! We were also thrilled with the service; Jay did such a good job I asked to speak to the manager to compliment him in his excellent service.

It was a rocky start, which dropped them from a 5 to 4 stars, but overall, the experience was great.

First, we arrive around 11:30am and there are a few people waiting. There were 2 hostesses and 1 server (I think) standing there chatting amongst themselves. They didn't greet us or acknowledge us at all. I finally said EXCUSE ME do we seat ourselves or how does this work? The hostess took our name and said it would be a 10-15 min wait, which I thought was strange since it wasn't very crowded at all. 

We did end up waiting 10 mins and were finally seated. Hostesses = fail.

Our server, Roxy, was AWESOME. The menu is so long and there are so many choices. Being our first time there, I had about a zillion questions and she was very patient and explained everything thoroughly, made suggestions, really helped us feel comfortable with the menu. She brought out everything so fast. I asked for a different drink because I didn't like the Arnold Palmer I ordered, and she brought a replacement in no time. We needed extra plates, and extra set of utensils because my 3 year old dropped his, and Roxy was on it. At the end of the meal Foxy brought my.kids 2 huge cookies (she asked permission first). Really great service.

On to the food...

To start they brought us 2 kinds of pickles - kosher and sour. Both were really good and crunchy. After pouring over the menu we finally decided on the Nova Lox bagel plate and the Dave's deli eggs benedict. Wow! First of all, these plates are HUGE. Don't expect to finish your meal. I was impressed with my bagel and lox plate. Served very traditionally - red onion, capers, cucumber...everything was so fresh and crisp...heaven! The smoked salmon aux really good flavor and texture. And the bagel...very fresh, toasted perfectly, really tasty, as was the cream cheese. Awesome execution of one of my traditional favorites. My husband had the Dave's deli eggs benedict which was perfect because it combined a lot of things we wanted to try- corned beef hash, latkes, eggs benedict - it really all came together beautifully. Great flavor. My kids split a kids meal - bagel and cream cheese and fresh fruit.

In short, the service and food were outstanding. I will definitely be back. And if they tighten up the front of the house and get their hostesses in check, I wouldn't hesitate to give this place 5 stars all the way."}

The partner ordered the scallops and they were good but the park belly was more fatty than crunch. The fennel greens seemed out of place and didn't blend well with the other flavors. It definitely needed something else to make the marriage work. 
Dessert was ok. The lemon was a nice zing to a one note meal."}

Very nice decor!  We had reservations, but the place was only about a third full on a Sunday night. This place is very pricey, so if your not prepared to pay over $100.00 a couple for dinner, pass this place by! The wait time for every thing we ordered was a little much, considering they were not that busy. Had the Lobster Bisque, very rich, and could have come with a bit more Lobster, and less croutons. Overall, the food was very good, so I'm actually between three and four stars. The wait staff is pretty attentive and friendly. They are very accommodating with special request regarding any food allergies, or restrictions you might have."}

Granted, I typically visit the one in Tempe, but in my previous experiences, they've all been pretty consistent. Today, I ordered Chompie's Benedict. Poached eggs are always hit or miss at casual places, but I'd ordered this before with success at the north Scottsdale location. The plate came out sloppy, but that's not really worth mentioning. The problem was that one of my poached eggs was raw. Of course a poached egg has a runny yolk but runny whites? Nope. Not eating that. I sent it back and the manager came out to argue with me that sometimes poached eggs have runny whites and that's just how they cook them. Well, why was one of them ok and the other was a blister sitting on a piece of ham? She eventually only charged me for the egg I did eat, which is fine, but why argue with me for not wanting to eat a raw egg?

TLDR: Not going back to the Chandler Chompie's. Tempe and Scottsdale are still ok."}

We walked in, were greeted and sat promptly at our reservation time. We were happy that we were seated in one of the off shoot rooms from the front area, much much less noisy. Waters were poured, server had introduced herself, complementary edamame were placed down and drink orders were taken. We ordered a Cosmo and a Martini on the rocks with extra olives. The Martini, came forgot the olives and there was a lime wedge with the Martini, wrong, sent it back and was redone and all was well.

We started off with appetizers of Tuna Poke and a Signature Roll, both very good. For entrees we had: Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, and Tempura California White Sea Bass.

All were perfectly cooked and very good. I can't say anything bad, but for the prices, Roy's still had that "Chain Restaurant" aura about it. Can't put my finger on it, maybe the decor, the amount of tables, the scent or the lighting? I think its a great fine dining family restaurant. Would I come here for a romantic evening, maybe not. Service and Food very good."}

They did not serve complimentary edamame which I almost always receive.  We ordered the potstickers--overcooked and too crunchy on edges.  The waiter recommended the calamari--it came in a very sour sauce that was not good.  I wish they had served the calamari with a side for dipping.  Having lived in HI, I know Poke and I have never seen it served with green tomatoes and odd sauce--nothing close to authentic.  Butterfish and short rib dinners were both covered with the same tomato and onion topping--very strange.  My wife did not receive a birthday dessert.

I asked Alex what the best selling soup is, and he told me it was the chicken matzo ball soup. Something that is familiar, yet he described it in a way which made me realize it had been a while since I'd had any, and I've been thinking about it since! Guess I'll have to come back in for some!

I'm not a huge fan of reviewing store chains, especially restaurant chains. 

When I'm writing a review, I want to make sure I am adding something unique, that perhaps someone didn't already know. Since chains are everywhere, everyone has already tried them so chain reviews usually basically come down to rehashing information we all already know or become a report card on what we thought of the service.

It's easy to look down on chains or take them for granted because they're probably run by a giant faceless corporation or some big fat cat. 

One of the notable exceptions is The Cheesecake Factory. 

THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY: THE HISTORY 

The Cheesecake Factory started in 1978 from an idea that a son of a baker couple had to showcase his mother's cheesecakes, as well as to add a restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory has a certain je ne sais quoi quality and is impressively successful operating on such a grand scale. 

What do I mean?

AMBIANCE 

The Cheesecake Factory is stunning and huge. There is the main dinning room, the bar and bakery areas. Each could conceivably operate on their own. The high ceilings with all the art work is pretty amazing. The craftsmanship of the bar is gorgeous. The whole restaurant is very well appointed. (see pics)

THE MENU

The Cheesecake Factory menu is massive. Not just in the quantity of items, but the scope as well. 

The menu features:
Appetizers/Small Plates/Snacks
Salads
Pizza 
Glamburgers/Sandwiches
Pastas
Steaks/Chops/Fish/Seafood
Eggs/Omelettes

There are 2 new sections:
"Super" Foods & Skinnylicious

"Super" Foods are nutrient rich special recipes with high sources of antioxidants. 

Some of these include:
Falafel Salad
Super Antioxidant Salad
Vegan Cobb Salad
Kale & Quinoa Salad

Skinnylicious are a collection of fresh & delicious menu options all at 590 calories or less. 

Obviously, desserts include cheesecake. 
Like ALL the cheesecakes ever invented!

Drink menu is extensive & creative. 

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

The Cheesecake Factory has a pretty consistent high level of service. Occasionally, there is a surly server, but it is rare. 

CONCLUSION 

5/5 RECOMMEND 

OF NOTE

*The Hours: 11am - 12am

*Extras:

Catering
Gift Cards
Ship A Cheesecake

Now think of all of those things I listed and multiply by 5 Phoenix Valley locations. 
(Chandler, Mesa, Biltmore, Kierland, & Peoria)
To have 5 massive restaurants all in the same city (over 200 locations total) and to be as successful as they are, for as long as they have been, is impressive and rare. 

The ability to just stop in to an epic environment with constantly high level & varied products and excellent service is beyond impressive, which unfortunately can be taken for granted.

Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.

The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?

I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling. 

The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door."}

The service was slightly slow and disorganized yet not horrible.  The Ahi tuna roll was fresh, flavorful and filling. The Macadamian Nut Mahi Mahi was better than what I read on the prior reviews and the dish was accompany with crisp cooked asparagus and properly seasoned potatoes. The chocolate flourless torte cake was the best of all. As I cut my fork into the delicious piece in front of me, I see a warm chocolate center oozing onto my plate like lava exploding out of a volcano. The taste is perfection in my mouth and worth the 3 miles on the treadmill.

My corned beef on rye?  Like buttah.  Oy like I need a great corned beef sandwich 5 minutes from the office.

I loved the decor and the hustle and bustle the place already has.  Great NY scenes all around blended in with an open modern feel.

Bonus wifi room past the deli counter.  Yes, you'll see me there with my laptop, coffee and some of that divine looking chocolate ruglach I saw in the case.

Happy to be getting up early and getting some b-fast with my BF and even more excited to be getting out of our typical 5 mile radius.  Trying a new place was the cherry on top!

Chompie's menu is gigantic and I was only looking at breakfast.  So much to choose from, I almost felt lost.  Pulled my typical move of narrowing it down to two or three and ask the server.  He recommended the Athens Skillet (sauteed spinach, artichokes, mushrooms, onions, garlic, tomato, feta, and jack cheese topped with two eggs and served over potatoes). I knew it was going to be a ton of food, but decided I could take it home to enjoy tomorrow.

Three things made this experience not my favorite, mostly my own fault and having nothing to do with Chompie's.  1) Something was off with Google Maps, so I was not able to 'check-in' using the Yelp app, it said I was a mile away.  Bummer.  2) Attempting to take that first bite of my delicious skillet, I cut into the egg with my fork and received a explosion of yolk on my shirt and white shorts.  Ugh!  3) When leaving the table, I left my huge box of leftovers sitting on the table.  *tear*

What can we all learn from my mishaps?  1) If you choose to eat your egg yolk runny, pierce it softly before diving in or maybe use your had to cover much like squeezing a lemon into a drink.  2) Put your leftovers somewhere that you have to take them to get out of the booth, maybe in your lap?

So, while I wasn't happy when I got home from Chompie's, I am still excited to return and do it right this time!"}

We attempted to make a reservation for a party of 40 in their semi-private room for an event we were having five months later. When I called, I was put on hold for about 4-5 minutes for almost every question I had about the reservation because each person had to ask the manager. Why they didn't just have the manager speak directly to me or have the manager call me back at a later time was beyond me. 

Given the large number of our party, I figured would at least get the courtesy of speaking to someone who could give me pricing and requirements for the party - if not over the phone right then and there, maybe a few days later. But, instead, I got the "someone will call you a week before the party date" brush-off. I mean, c'mon - I was reserving FIVE MONTHS in advance! Could I at least get answers from someone well beforehand?! Needless to say, I quickly changed my mind and we decided to have our event elsewhere.

We were disappointed that we couldn't have our event there because we love the food ... But with how difficult it was to get answers, it just wasn't worth it. Subpar service like that would have ruined our celebration."}

I ordered a Navajo chicken sandwich.  My daughter ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and my friends ordered an Asian chicken salad and a chicken salad sandwich.  20 minutes later, my friends got their food.  And I wait and i wait, and finally 5 minutes later Megan and I got ours.  So we finally begin to eat.  The food was just okay, didn't really taste like much of anything.  Megan said her cheeseburger was ok.  Megan and I also both got a margarita, and for  $8.00 you get about 6 ounces of drink, and that's frozen margaritas, not on the rocks.  Glasses are TINY and the drink was not anywhere near good.   Certainly not worth $8.00.  Restaurant is so noisy you have to  yell across the table to hear anyone, and at night they dim the lights so low you have to really focus on the menu or you can't read it.    All in all a pretty bad experience.   The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the cheesecake is pretty good.  $8 for a slice, definitely not worth that, but it tastes good.  I won't be going back and if you don't go either, there's no doubt you have made the right choice."}

Someone needs to use the restroom. If you ever have the need preparers be disgusted. These are some of the nasties restrooms in the in industry. The floors are covered in grease, they smell, they look like they are never professionally cleaned. Check out the partially alive cock roach laying on the floor. Then you have to touch the soap dispenser and the handles and the towel dispenser. 

Sure few people wash their hands thoroughly for 2-3 minutes with soap in hot water but most people don't use enough soap and clearly don't rinse for 2 minutes and the rest of the people, kids included, leave the piss and crap on their hands...and all that leave this room with the cooks, wait staff, hostesses, dishwashers, etc. fecal matter EVERYWHERE because everyone has to touch all that stuff. 

Back to the ROACH...well if there is 1 there is at least 1000. If their germs aren't enough then think of all that poison that is needs to partially kill this one. It has to be all over this establishment. Picture to prove it...check it out. 

Someone needs to call the health inspector and they should bring the roach patrol. This place is nasty."}

We shared a White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. The crust of the cheesecake was a black cookie crust and was very good. The cheesecake came with two large  mountains of whipped cream, probably way too much whipped cream any person should eat in one sitting. Regardless it was a chill atmosphere, and the dessert was good. The whole place has soft music playing but feels very loud and is hard to talk while in there, not sure if it was the 3 other tables of people or just the architectural design of the place producing a lot of echo/feedback. I knocked it down a few stars for the service. Server did not come around often (or at all), had to get her attention before she would come take our order and again to get our check. Our drinks were empty and didn't get refilled. Overall, good cheesecake, bad service. No comment on the food."}

We went on Friday night and saw that they have an all you can eat fish and chips special. My husband asked the hostess what kind of fish it was, and she said, "cod, I would guess." Strange that she would guess about what they are having for the special.
We were seated right away and our server was nice. She took our drink orders and got the drinks quickly. She recommended the fish special saying it was great.
I ordered half of a corned beef sandwich with fries and my husband ordered the fish. While we waited for our food, someone tried to serve us the food from 3 other tables. I could see how that would happen once, but 3 times! 
My sandwich was fine. I ordered it lean, so it was a bit dry. Their fries are great - and they did not disappoint. The plate of fish and chips was heaping full. The fish looks like it's hand breaded as the breading was very puffy. But it was awful - the fish was really tough and nearly inedible. 
My husband left more than half of it on his plate, and the server didn't notice or even ask us how things were. When she brought our credit card back for signature, I told her that the fish was really bad, and pretty much inedible. She said, "i wish you had told me that before." That's all. She didn't even offer to share my complaint with the manager. As we left, the hostesses asked how our meal was and I again told them that the fish was terrible. They just kind of shrugged and said they were sorry - again, nothing was done to alert management or try to correct the bad impression left on us. 

Their prices are high for a casual restaurant, so they need to really do something to impress you to keep your business. They are not doing that.

I'll probably go back for sliced meat at the deli and maybe some baked goods, but not to have a meal on location."}

For desert I had the chocolate dish that takes 20 minutes to make (they tell you in advance, so that's not a problem) which was actually pretty good.

For the price the place is not worth it. It's ok for a date but not if you're looking for good food. Specially if you're not willing to drop $60 per person and leave unsatisfied.

Well I have been eating waaay too many salads this month, so I was really hard up for some meat and some tasty animal fat... wasn't wanting to go all out, but I definitely wanted a non-salad meal, heavy with protein & animal fat.  I didn't exactly pick this place (it was more of a group decision), but it would have to do.  

Our party of 4 got seated quickly during prime Fri lunch time and commenced to read the literary novel that is their 15 page menu (ok, maybe more like 8)...  'I want some meat, a big ass hunk of meat... ooh, there's a mile-high pastrami... nah.. OOoh, how bout sliders?.. nah, too much bread..  fish?...ooh, they have all-you-can-eat fish & chips today???... FOCUS April! you're looking for MEAT... alright... maybe a burger?.. yeah.. gluten free bread?.. hmm.. not bad.. why not?.. oh yeah, AND with BACON on it.. and some cheese!'  There! I had gone through all my meat-options on the menu and settled on a huge bacon cheese-burger with a Gluten-Free bun and side of sweet potatoes.  

When the order came up, it was ginormous!  Actually, ALL our orders were huge plates, plentiful with fries and those who got mile-highs were also stacked high with sandwich meat.  We all walked out stuffed and some with to-go boxes.  I tried the fish & chips and it was decent (not better than the fish I've had at FIbbers, but decent).  I wasn't underwhelmed with my Gluten-free bun.  It was tall and had a small diameter (like a muffin), so it was very awkward to eat it as the 'bun' when the huge diamater meat patty hung over... so I just removed it and had the patty, bacon, and cheese solo.. and of course some fries.  BTW, their fries were, across the plates at our table, soggy and not crisp (my table partners didn't like that, but I love soggy fries, so I can't complain.. apparently, soggy is not the popular vote for fries).

All in all: quick seating at lunch time, friendly waitress did her job, manager came by to great us, food was huge portions, soggy fries, odd GF bun, great selection of deserts, overwhelming lunch menu... immediate lunch food coma."}

First off, the service is awesome! Matthew is extraordinary at the bar! He is very friendly, super-attentive, knowledgeable and generous. I recommend dining at the bar if you have the option.

Next, the decor is very pleasing. Though the locations I've been to on the Islands (Kauai and Ko'Olina) are wonderful just because it is Hawaii afterall, the design of this location is more aesthetically pleasing and intimate. I've dined here a total of three times now - twice in the bar and once in the restaurant and I find it very enjoyable.

Finally, the food is consistent with all other Roy's locations, which is very good. Tonight I enjoyed the potstickers and had just an "okay" experience with the seasonal salad only because I didn't inquire about the dressing (didn't pair well with my wine). Matthew was kind enough to bring me something to clear my palate afterwards so I could enjoy the remainder of my wine. From my recollection of the other two visits, I remember the food to be quite enjoyable (I believe I had the butterfish at least once and maybe even twice).

When in Chandler, Roy's definitely ranks highly in my book. I almost went somewhere else to expand my experience when in the area, though am glad I didn't. 

I've dined at several other Roy's just for context: Kauai, Ko'Olina, San Francisco, and Carmel and this is one of the nicest. Who knows, I may be visiting the Ko'Olina location again in just over a week..."}

I asked for some green Cholula sauce but they only had green tabasco which is not nearly as good.  My husband's experience has been hit or miss.  Today was not outstanding.  He ordered his eggs "over medium" but they were served runny.  The server did not stop by soon enough to ask if he was satisfied, so he ate the runny eggs.  When she did stop by, she offered to have the cook remake the eggs, but he declined.  Nevertheless, she did ask the chef to remake the eggs and the second attempt was even runnier.  She then offered a free bagel for him to take home.  His chicken fried steak looked pre-formed rather than hand breaded and the gravy on top was so-so.  He really enjoyed the crispy hash browns and the jalapeno cheese bagel that accompanied his entree.  Prices are a bit high, so when food is not perfectly prepared and/or served, it is frustrating.  The server was adequate, but not especially accommodating or friendly."}

A friend of mine was in town but only had limited time to meet up, so a group of about 15 people (plus three small children) decided to meet for lunch.  We did the smart thing and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1:30.  We were seated in a "party room" which had a TV, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty.  Three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them.  The floor hadn't been swept.  And, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there.

So now for the real problem...  We were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in.  We all ordered food and drinks.  It became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed.  It must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks.  I don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pitchers of water and glasses during that time?  Drinks finally arrived.  Then nothing.  It was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table.  I'm not joking.  An hour later and our meals still weren't ready.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time.  Fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time.  Everyone was hungry.  Neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen.  When our orders finally arrived at 3:00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables (a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain).  The saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong.  The waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3:30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out.

The one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other Chompie's.  Which is excellent.  The ambiance is modern instead of old fashion deli.  But the service was a complete fail.  They knew a big group was coming, if they were unable to accommodate us, they should have warned us."}

Even thought I explained that everyone was on the way she would not sit the 4 of us that were there early.  

Upon sitting down, our waiter was very accommodating.  Brought us all waters and took drink orders.  After browsing the extensive menu items I choose a turkey sandwich from the skinny menu.  Food took a while to come out of the kitchen & my niece waited the longest for some kid sliders.  I was literally done with my turkey sandwich before they brought out her sliders.  Not sure what happened in the kitchen to forget about 2 small sliders.  I'm not a fan of the decor of Cheesecake factory or the sitting arrangement made for a large party.  I felt trapped where they sat us.  

After dinner was over we all ordered some cheesecake, because why not?  We opted for the brownie sundae and a slice of cookie dough cheesecake.  No complaints in this department.  Both good options for dessert.  All in all I wouldn't eat here again.  The food is OK and the service is OK.  Some people rave about this place, but for the price of the food I know I can have a better dining experience somewhere else."}

That in and of itself was a mistake as the place was extremely busy and required a 50 minute wait (hostess said 15-20 min). In the meanwhile we checked the place out and reviewed the menu to determine our order.

Finally seated and our waiter takes our order - brings us back our drinks and then disappears. Our coffee and soda's go dry. The table behind us locates their own condiments and refills. Oh, look our waiter returns - long enough to give us a refill and tell us he was bored. Yesterday was evidently much busier and today isn't even a challenge for him. WOW! 

So our order comes out and we have to give directions on what needs corrected. We wait while he re-does my wife's order. Which then comes out cold and still isn't correct. Seriously?

I was told how big the sandwiches are, so I ordered a half pastrami, thinking the $8 price tag isn't really as much as it seems, since the sandwich will be the size of a "regular" size sandwich. Um, yeah, that part didn't pan out. I got a small sandwich piled high pastrami and a little cup of cole slaw. The food itself was good, not great like the hype. 

Our waiter - yeah, he's missing again and we get no refills. I also noticed management was MIA. He returns long enough to give us the check. There's a mistake on the bill, which he corrects but we of course have to wait and wait.

 My final opinion? Too expensive for the sandwich I had and breakfast everyone else in my party had. The food is good but the price to quantity ratio is off. If this place didn't have the fanboys it does, I'd say it was doomed, particularly in today's more cost conscious economy."}

Normally I get amazing service and exactly what I want. Today was not the case. I asked for my usual with extra spread, and it was abysmal. I have always gotten what I wanted and offered to pay extra which I am never charged. However today if it were any lighter on spread, I would need to order more to cover the bagel. Please listen to your customers and give them what they want. So disappointing. I even offered to pay extra it's not a problem. Perhaps if you don't normally work in the deli area, you shouldn't be helping out."}

It's Hawaiian themed with a born of Asian influence as well. It's upscale inside with white linens and lighter woods that give it a Hawaiian feel. They have a nice wall of wine when you enter the restaurant.

Our waiter was very good and knew the menu well. He paced the meal very well and was attentive, yet not overwhelmingly so alike some waiters.

I started with the appetizer sampler (Asian ribs, chicken satay, tuna roll, lobster potstickers, and tuna roll). All of the elements were well prepared and seasoned appropriately.

Then I had the grilled Caesar salad. I really like that the salad wasn't drowning in dressing like lots of restaurants often do. 

My entree was seared ahi with rice. It was a perfect seat on he outside, yet tender and rare on the inside. The sticky rice was great as well.

The side order of mac and cheese was very cheesy and rich, loaded with bacon and breadcrumbs."}

this was a special occasion because it happened to be my birthday!! my husband and i decided to do something special and spend the weekend away from tucson and drive up to the phoenix area. i was excited to find a local favorite of mine from back home up here on the mainland. 

i made my special birthday dinner reservation and was even excited that they answered the phone with a friendly 'aloha'.

as expected, we were seated at a nice, intimate table. the one thing i love about roy's is how personalized he makes your experience. because they knew i was coming in for my birthday dinner, they made a nice little insert for the menus brought to our table. when we were done ordering, they rolled the inserts up and gave them to us to have as keepsakes. 

our server was gracious and kind the entire evening. 
the husband had a combination of two types of seafood -- fish and scallops (that were hugeeeee!!) and i got the filet mignon. everything was cooked to perfection. of course we had to get the chocolate soufflé for desert. you can't ever go to roy's and not get chocolate soufflé. it should be against the law. it has to be the best desert on the face of the earth [in my humble opinion]. to top that off, they even brought out their signature flourless chocolate complete with candle and our server took our picture and framed it to also take home.

we both left fat & happy. if i could have it my way, i'd choose roy's restaurant for every special occasion we celebrate because the people that work for roy always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. 

mahalo nui loa a hui hou, roy's chandler! hope to see you soon!"}

Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad.  For service, I give this location a 2.  We sat down right away.  It took about 10 minutes to get a drink order which one of the hostesses had to take because our waiter was too busy to take it.  When he finally came over to our table, the hostess was taking our order for our waiter, he started taking my husband's order.  They had to combine their notes to get the order straight.  It took about 30 minutes to get our sandwiches.  I had a 1/2 tongue sandwich.  The meat was  not just soft, it was gushy.  I also order a potato kanish, it was grumbling as I was eating it. It should have been soft. My husband loved his corned beef 1/2 sandwich. I guess that was the highlight of the evening.

We paid for our food and went to the bakery and had to wait 5 minutes for the guy at the counter to get our order for bagels and black and whites.  He actually was very nice and gave us a bag and put my leftovers from dinner and my black and whites into a bag for me. Actually this was the highlight of my evening.  

Chompies as a whole is going down in quality lately no matter what location you go to.  This is still the best location that I ever went to and I've been to Tempe, Scottsdale and this one. With the hit and misses that I have experience, I wouldn't go to any other one."}

The "small bites" appetizer, PORTABELLA, AVOCADO, ZUCCHINI FRIES came out and were so delicious. Here is our complaint. What happened to our server after the food came out?  She was not to be found. We wanted our check, a to go container, and had ordered cheesecake to go at the end of our meal. She forgot about our previously ordered cheesecake and when she finally brought it, we had been waiting 20 min at this point. Not everybody that goes out to eat wants to be there for over 2 hours. The waitress had a lame made up excuse that the dessert counter was backed up. What a lie as we could see it from our table and it was dead. She just waited so long to go over to get it. She never refilled our drinks. The actual cheesecake I ate at home, "chocolate chip cookie dough" was tasteless and dry. Maybe I should have given 1 star but I do love the Asian chicken salad and my husband enjoyed his filet mignon. Eating out shouldn't be such a pain. The acoustics are also bad. We were near a screaming, crying toddler who was out clearly too late. This gave me a headache.  We left at about 945 pm and now had missed the movie we had planned to see."}

A friend and I went for Aloha hour and it was awesome. Everything on the HH menu is only $5!   We enjoyed everything from the food, drinks, & service, that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu.

9/4/2010
My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying. 

For my meal I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It came with black "forbidden" rice and bok choy.  Each flaky bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Excellent choice!

This is where it gets ugly...
As our average service was about to conclude, the waiter drops our check off. I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect?? 
He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left.
Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!! 
The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying "May I say 'Sorry' to you?" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.

Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!"}

The bartender was a little rude, maybe just aloof...but definitely not put together. I don't understand why management wouldn't want their bartenders to look presentable especially when working at a nicer restaurant. Does it really take a lot of effort to brush your hair or put on a little makeup..she looked like she just rolled out of bed to go serve her local dive bar. Makes me feel like I'm at some hole in the wall place. Didn't help that another bartender or server who was tabbing someone out in front of me put the persons credit card in his MOUTH while he messed with the screen. Come on, seriously. 

Besides that the ambiance was fine, I sat at the bar on a Friday and while it was busy, you could still get a seat pretty quick. The ribs for $7 happy hour price were AMAZING. You get 4 and they slide right off the bone. Can't say enough good things about them and everyone was ordering them. The lobster potstickers were sooo good too, definitely will order again. We also tried the mac and cheese (didn't like them - it was more noodles with not enough flavor or cheese), and the crab fried rice (I liked there were big pieces of crab in them, would probably get again). 
It's a good place to try, I'd like to go back for their full dinner menu."}

During Customer Appreciation Week this year I went to the Chompies in Chandler 3 times for Jewish Sliders that were 2 for $5.  These were the worst sliders I have ever eaten.  They were not fresh, no cheese on them, super small compared to regular sliders, the gravy was way too salty and really dark compared to other times.  I have ordered the sliders over 5 times during non-customer appreciation week and they are always bigger, not as salty and fresher.  The first time I called back and spoke with Mitch and he said if I have another problem I should ask for a manager.  Next time I went I asked to speak with someone when I got my smaller than normal sliders for the second time in a row and I waited about 5 mins and no one came back to me.  Then I ordered them again on Friday July 27th and they were better but still super small.  Very skimpy, barely any meat, but did taste better and wasn't so salty.  Bottom line don't get sliders during Customer Appreciation Week it is a scam/sham, I don't like writing reviews and complain but this needed to be said.  If I had never gone to Chompies before I probably wouldn't have realized I was getting skimped on the sliders, seems like a small issue but this is not right and Chompies is already way over priced and expensive for the food they serve, we like it cause it is open on holidays and convenient.  I will be boycotting Chompies for a while.  They really don't appreciate their customers, this is a great example of them trying to make more money."}

Chef Patrick totally took care of us and made my mom feel so special on her birthday.  He was voted one of the Nations Top Chefs of 2013 for an obvious reason!  He's amazing!  The cocktails are scrumptious!  Yet the food was a journey of flavor, excitement, and decadence.  It started with edamame and we just kept building our taste buds with salads, calamari, pan seared scallops, pork belly, butter fish, kobe egg rolls, and dessert was heavenly.  We all felt incredibly spoiled by all these wonderful flavors and textures!  I'd recommend this restaurant even to those less adventurous foodies too.  The service was awesome!  t's just a treat for anyone.  GO!"}

The decor and ambiance inside is nice, the hostess greeted us quickly and showed us to our table and handed us our cloth napkins. For starters we ordered the calamari and the calamari itself was lacking seasoning on the batter, but the firecracker sauce definitely made up for it. It had an Asian flare and nice spicy kick. I ordered the filet mignon and what I got did not look nor taste like the filet mignons I've ever had before. It was a flat piece of meat that was overly charred and burned on the outside and covered up with some kind of weird sauce that didn't taste very good. My husband got the Roy's trio that came with ahi tuna, butterfish, and salmon with a side of rice. He didn't like the ahi and said it tasted funny and the other two fishes were just ok. Our server took forever to come back after we got out food to ask how things were and we wanted to ask for hot sauce and a redo if the steak but the time we waited for him to come back just wasn't worth it. The fries we ordered were nothing great. We saw on yelp pictures that other guests got really nice anniversary desserts and what we got was definitely not the same but I understand times change and it was better than nothing. Overall, nothing great and we probably won't come back."}

Without a doubt it has to be the worst managed restaurant I've been to in quite some time.

For the second weekend in a row I've tried to eat here and for the second weekend in the row I've walked out the door.

So what happened?

I walk in around noon and the waiting area is packed (as it was last week).  And as last week there were plenty of tables in the main dining area and as last week the dining area on the north side of the restaurant was completely empty (although in fairness I'm not sure I've ever seen it used).

So I asked the hostess what's up (BTW...why do restaurants insist on having very young people at this critical position?).  Her answer was that they have all of the open tables so they can give the wait staff time to service the tables they have.  

What the f@ckity f@ck f@ck???!!!???  Are you kidding me???  Did it ever occur to you to actually schedule the number of staff to handle the number of customers??  

One day after this places goes out of business, they should take the time out to see when and where  it all went off the rails.  Part of the reason will be because they can't manage to schedule enough staff to service their customers."}

It was soooo good.  The service was perfect and the ambiance fun and colorful.  My husband had the turkey dinner, so delicious.  Real white meat turkey, not a turkey roll like a lot of places do and the stuffing was delicious also.  The gravy was real (I know good gravy, I love gravy) this gravy was not from a can and it had bits of turkey in it, very flavorful.
We also had the onion rings with their dipping sauce, it reminded me a bit of Outback blooming onion and sauce, defiantly homemade, would have that again.
Looking forward to going back for another item on the menu."}

I came excited when I heard about New York inspired foods with a Jewish flare talked about on yelp. I was ready to enjoy knish, matzo balls and the famous Jewish sliders. Then I got lost in a menu straight from the labyrinth and things went south.

The potato knish was a sad sight. Overly cooked on the corners and it blurred into a mound of oil and disenchantment when cut into. Was I in the right place??

The matzo balls came next I know now they are supposedly made of fried matzo meal with eggs and oil, it made me think it was a fancy version of fry bread. However the texture was too odd for me. Having ranch as a side made these passable but utterly forgettable. Are they supposed to be really really greasy??

My Jewish and Western sliders where nothing to write home about. Although I will write to inform you good people that the bread was the best part. From there on the low quality meat really takes center stage as overly oiled fries with an odd skin( likely frozen) bitters a sweet idea with uninspired compromise. The onion ring batter was bland and the onions were so small I almost missed them.

The food missed the mark. The press this place got was undeserved today but even if it wasn't there were a few other things that would keep me away. But I will only talk about the one.

The Menu!!! What the hell? I need a subway map to navigate the damn thing, well over 80 menu options on board. Breakfast served all day. That's nice except I can't make up my damn mind without pulling out my reading glasses for this epoch of a menu. The items where strewn about with no coherent arrangement beside the common starter/entree array which is still convoluted. 

I walked out broke and disgusted with myself , like Vegas but less fun. I would say the greasy and flour loaded meals sound like a good cheat meal, but the only person who gets hurt is you...

Our eating utensils were dirty and spotty, we were told by the waitress that polished silverware is reserved for evening dining (unbelievable)! The manager returns to our table with the explanation, "you all caught me in the middle of polishing the utensils"...so she gave us a clean set. Then we wanted to try the grilled shrimp and was told the shrimp was for evening only, but she would ask the chef, and were presented with a large plate and four small shrimp for $16. she explained the small shrimp were $4 each, a price invented because the appetizer is not on the menu. Needless to say we will never return."}

I have to say, my experience tonight at Roy's was pretty fantastic.  Service was great.  The bar was quiet and not too full.  A menu full of unique Hawaiian inspired cocktails to choose from and wine and beer all for $5.  Six different, all delicious, $5 appetizers to choose from including lobster pot stickers, sliders w/sweet potato fries, beef skewers, ahi tuna roll, salt and pepper calamari, and one more lobster one . . . I forget.  The calamari and sliders w/fries were my favorite.

This is a great place to go when you want a good happy hour, but aren't looking for the crowded, busy spots.  This was a great place to eat, drink, and catch up on conversation.  

While we were lingering around waiting for our friends and after finishing our food, our server was great about checking in, but not too much.  Making sure we didn't miss happy hour, but not pressuring us either.  Never felt rushed or that we were putting her out by trying to get one more appetizer in just under the wire.

And the drinks were great!  Normally, the fruity drinks don't appeal to me.  But with names like Basil Cucumber Collins, or Cilantro Cucumber Margarita, Pineapple Ginger Mojito, Lemongrass Sake-tini, (the list goes on and on) I couldn't resist.  AND, the wine was great, had a glass of the Malbec.  BF liked his beer.

Oh, and all of this Aloha goodness . . . DAILY . . . 4:30-6:30!  Nice!

This place is a little loud.  Not sure why.  It wasn't even full.  But it was loud.  Nice ambiance other than the 'loud'.  An understated tropical feel. I could do without the TV's in the bar, or at least partition them better.  Made the place look like a sports bar (there was some sort of sporting event going on).  The fish tank is nicer but too small to see everywhere.

This was our anniversary.  I expected the place to be full so I made reservations ahead of time.  They asked if we were celebrating anything, and they do a few special little things for your event.  That was nice.  There were three menus.  They had a special three-course meal menu (which my wife ordered), a one-page special drink menu (I didn't really look closely at that one), and the main menu.  The main menu is probably about 1/2 drink menu (the first two pages at least).  The waitress was very professional and explained the different menus, and then made some recommendations.  I went with the grilled ono (a type of fish) because she said it was a house specialty.  I also got the poke appetizer because I like poke.

So the appetizers arrive.  My wife chose the calamari salad as part of her three-course menu option.  I tried it.  It was good.  Not extraordinary, but good.  I did think adding heat to it was a bit odd.  Calamari isn't a strong flavor and you're going to add jalapeño to it (or whatever chile it was)?  I know you want to set yourself apart, but that doesn't seem like an appropriate match to me.  I will be returning to this theme shortly.  The poke was good.  I thought a bit too much avocado with it, but I could taste the poke.  It came with chips which would have been good for scooping, but the chips overwhelmed the poke.  Maybe it was the combination of a lot of avocado with the chips that dulled the poke too much, but I just ate it with a fork instead. It would have been better to emphasize the tuna in the poke. 

My wife's entree was the mahi mahi.  By itself it wasn't really very good, but there was a little puddle of dipping sauce (green).  If you used that it was much better.  That flavor combination seemed to work reasonably well.  The kimchee pancakes that came with it were OK.  Not great.  Dipping sauce didn't help.  My ono was fine, if a little sour.  Delicate flavor that they didn't seem to do much with that I could detect.  Just grilled it, maybe some lemon juice (I assume since it was a little sour).  It came with a cheesy risotto that was too strong for the fish, but did counteract the sour.  It was good risotto, but I couldn't taste the fish at all.  So, again, we have a flavor combination that didn't seem to work right.

Presentation was impeccable for all dishes. They clearly paid attention to that detail, which is nice.  Service was pretty good.  Just about the time you started to wonder if they were going to check on you, they checked on you.  A little slower than other places, but at the same time they're giving you privacy for your dinner companion.

The last course was a chocolate souffle, and it was great.  A lot like a lava cake (really hot chocolate sauce inside).  It was probably the best thing we had that night.  My wife also really liked her mango "martini" (actually it was a mango-rum drink).

So in summary, we had flavors that didn't seem to compliment each other well in at least two things we ate.  Presentation was expert, service was good, the little extras for our anniversary were nice.  But I can't say I'm a fan, especially at these prices.  For the price paid the food should have been a harmonious symphony of flavors, not a dischordant attempt to partner mismatched flavors.  If you're going to try to be high-end and charge high-end prices, your food has to be high-end too.  And it just wasn't.  I'm willing to concede it may have been a function of what we ordered.  The mahi mahi with green sauce worked, but it's weird that two of our items didn't quite hit the flavor harmony that they should have.  I'm going with three stars (barely) because of the mahi mahi, the chocolate souffle, and the poke (without the chips).  But I would only recommend it with the caveat that maybe if you order something different you might have better luck with the flavor symphony."}

But the to-go bakery orders get messed up every time i come here. I'm talking, for years. Always someone different. It's like they just don't care.  

The last guy was completely apologetic, but not apologetic enough to get a manager to open the locked door after I discovered our strawberries for the strawberry cheesecake (you pay extra for them) were not in our bag. We were in the mall. The mall doors were locked, and we were trying to go back out the door we came in. He made me go outside around to their front door to bring me the strawberries. I'm glad some lady was coming out the mall door and held it for me to go back in, or I'd have had to walk all the way around the mall to my car in the cold w/o my coat or my family, who were way inside and I said I'd be right back.

People must like it despite the high prices, because it's usually packed and there's always a wait if we want to eat here. I've just had bad experiences getting the to-go bakery items."}

The boyfriend and i hit up Roy's on a Friday night. We didn't have reservations so we were offered a table in the bar. The bar isn't very big but it was full so it was pretty loud. The noise was a tad distracting so I might try the dining room next time.

But other than that we had a nice time. I ordered a Mai Tai to drink and the Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi for my entree. Boyfriend ordered the filet. The Mai Tai was yummy and rummy. Although a bit on the pricey side - $12. I did not order a second. My Mahi Mahi was served with new potatoes and gravy and asparagus. The fish was done perfectly and had a great texture and flavor. The potatoes were nice and tender and the asparagus was good too. The portion of the fish was quite large.
Boyfriend's filet was tasty as well. Slightly more done than he likes it but not overdone. The steak comes with mashed potatoes (with bacon!) and broccoli. He did not hesitate in cleaning his plate.

For desert we ordered the chocolate lava cake. Maybe I was just too full but I found this to be a little underwhelming. The ice cream was more like frozen yogurt and while the cake was full of oozing chocolate it just didn't have that decadent chocolate taste I was hoping for.

Overall I was very happy with my night at Roy's. I would definitely go back."}

That's what I thought when looking at the menu this afternoon. But, I was meeting with a former coworker and dear friend who had her perfect baby girl almost two months ago and she needed to get out of the house, so it was a date. She was running late so I ordered the ahi tartare, which is served over chopped avocados and soy sauce. This was very good, and helped to curb my appetite until she arrived. I ordered the lunch pizza, which comes with a salad. I try to go for a white pizza because red sauce some times tends to disagree with me. A pretty good pizza. The salad was fine as far as salads go, but the shredded carrots and cucumbers proved to be messy and I ended up with enough salad on my lap to feed a family of rabbits. Seriously, normally I'm not nearly as messy.

Heather, our server, was great! She managed to be attentive without hovering, an important yet rare quality that landed her a dandy tip.

But all that pales in comparison to my wonderful dining companions, one of whom I'm proud to call a friend and the other who will hopefully be calling me Uncle in the near future."}

I try not to visit chain restaurants as much as possible, but when Mom texted that she could meet me somewhere for a bite to eat, it was much easier to tell her to meet me at The Cheesecake Factory at the mall than it was to give her directions to try a local place in downtown Phoenix or elsewhere.  (Believe me, I've tried.)

Since we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.  

We decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead.

Great service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.  Why even bring stale, hardened bread to the table?  It's the reason why I downgraded from the previous four-star rating to a three..."}

Another amazing winner is their Avocado Eggrolls.  Every single person I have taken here is in love with this appetizer.

My family adores almost every entree we have tried here, sans the Cuban Sandwich.

Now to my most recent problem with them.  My wife and I took our daughter here for her 18th birthday dinner (at her request).  My wife told them in advance we were here for an 18th b-day, and then reminded the hostess upon our arrival.  At no point during our stay, did anyone come out to bestow birthday wishes to my daughter, although we did witness their singers at two other tables.

Great food, hit & miss service, and sometimes no birthday wishes... :("}

I take my in-laws here for dinner each Christmas, when I cash out some Amex points for gift cards. This is a nice upscale establishment, with an accessible waitstaff and bar crew. Everyone is very friendly and quite knowledgeable about the menu.

The group favorite here is the prix fixe menu, which gets you three courses. The entrees have varied - the last time I was there only one fish option was listed as the entree. (This is odd for a Hawaiian fusion place.) The short ribs I had instead where quite good, however.

The bar crew here is very good, and they make a killer mojito. No beer on tap, though, which is disappointing. (A nice draft Sapporo would go quite well with the fish.) 

The atmosphere is upscale casual, so you can get by in nice pants (even jeans) and a nice shirt. Don't be that guy in the baseball cap, though."}

It does take a long time to get in for brunch, especially on the weekends. Be prepared to wait, but it is so worth it. They have a deli/bakery you can peruse while you wait.

The servers are a bit stand off-ish, but that kind of adds to the NY feel of the deli. They have breakfast all day, as well as lunch/dinner options. I've had both, but today went with savory.

I started with their matzo ball soup...amazing. It's homemade, with light and fluffy matzo balls, a wonderfully seasoned broth, and carrots and onions. 

For my entree, I had the Nike high pastrami on rye. It was probably the largest sandwich I've ever seen in my life/ the homemade rye bread was excellent, and the pastrami was so well done and lean!! I could barely finish the sandwich given it's size!

One of the best brunch/breakfast options in Phoenix. If you're really hungry try the slider challenge that was featured on Man v Food."}

We had asked for water and hadn't received it after being sat for 10 minutes. I eventually had to walk up to the hostesses to ask them to track our server down.

My girlfriend wanted to surprise me with the start of my birthday week so she planned a surprise visit to Chompie's Deli. She had this on the agenda for some time and was so excited to have finally been able to put it in a day out to the mall. 

I was so excited when we pulled up because she had raved about this place and being I am from New York/ Staten Island, we were both so excited about this outing. 

I will say I am a New York critic to places that say they are "New York" so please understand my point of view. If you say your place is based on a place, it should be don't you think? I don't think places should make money off of s theme unless they are true to it.

We don't go out to eat much so the place has to be good for us to go.

My first impression was great with the bakery display of all the "goods". I wanted to sink my teeth into "one of each" but as soon as the young lady behind the counter spoke, we were disappointed. She lacked any kind of confidence,  happiness or maybe a smile, knowledge of the products or history of this place. I get we all have our days of not doing so good but I could tell this was her personality each day. That was the first impression of the people that worked there. We shrugged it off and went about ordering a corn beef sandwich, fries, cold slaw and pickle (or course). We ordered it to go and was told that we they would let us know when the order was ready. That never happened so I went up there to see if it was ready and they looked at me like "yes"? I shrugged it off, took the food and went and sat down. We thought it would be quicker to get an order to go verses "in" dining but we were wrong. We should have just ordered it "in" and maybe they would know we were here?  We proceeded to share this meal and I will say - the entire meal was great tasting however if I combined the poor service and the over priced meal - I don't need to return again. 

A place of business should never Always be in business just for the money and that's what I felt here. It should be about customer service, quality and price. This place didn't have all of that for me. I will say they pack a very good meal but  shouldn't it be about the over all experience? I feel it should be. I can go anywhere and just get something to eat. I don't mind paying a bit more if I have everything I want in a place.
If I'm not treated well at a restaurant, I just assume stay home. We as customers pay for empoyee's to work correct? We pay their wages so I feel if we are doing that, we should get great customer service. They also get a tip that should be worked for, never assumed. 

PS I also bought 2 poppy bagels for our breakfast in the morning and I don't need to buy them again either. This was not a New York bagel. I couldn't even taste the poppy seeds.

PSS If I would have read reviews before going, I would have never gone seeing a review with a cockroach!!! Yuck!!
I was pretty disappointed. No need for a revisit."}

I was hungry so I wanted avocado toast or a pasta but their bread and pastas have eggs baked in. One of their complimentary breads was eggless so our waiter brought a basket of that for me which was so sweet. I ended up ordering the falafel sandwich without any cheese. I didn't like it very much. The falafel did not taste very good, it was really mushy and tasted kind of sour.

I generally only eat lunch here, dinner on occasion and even at the peak of the lunch hour, I have never experienced slow or lacking service.

Today we were really hungry, so we started with Buffalo Blasts for an appetizer, these are amazing (see pics).  They taste like a fabulous combination of fried chicken and hot wings, served with hot sauce, blue cheese (the real deal) and celery sticks.  We both ordered salads, the BBQ Ranch Chicken (topped with onion rIngs) and the Chinese Chicken salad which has always been delicious.  We finished off the meal with a slice of Vanilla Bean cheesecake which is lighter than some of the other kinds, and absolutely delicious.  I could enjoy a big bowl of the whip cream by itself!

My vote so far that this event has been the best one attended.  If you are a foodie, want to celebrate and event, or just want to have fun, relax and enjoy a special meal in a small venue, maybe even meet some new friends which we did, this would be it.

Dusckhorn vineyards ran this event, throughout the dinner, giving a short history of each wine paired with each dishes. the 5 wonderful dishes were Hawaiian Kampachi, Lobster Dim Sum, Kurobuta Pork Kakuni, Shoyu Charred Ribeye and a Mille Feuille for desert. Every dish was presented beautifully and tasted superb with a wine (except for the desert).

Atmosphere: Roy's decor, but in a private room. Service: excellent, Food: excellent"}

First off, I ordered the veggie burger without cheese or mayo. My friends ordered pizza and shrimp pasta. By the time their food came out and they were done eating, my food still hadn't come out. I eventually had to just ask for them to bring my food out in a box because it was taking way too long. Additionally, my sister ordered Mac and cheese and it was never brought out. And throughout all this, the waitress never mentioned how long the food was going to take, and never apologized for the poor service. 

Then, get this. The waiter asked me if I wanted cheesecake. I kindly told her that I couldn't have dairy products and she told me she would bring me out a chocolate fudge cake. I was a bit confused if this cake was going to be vegan or not, but I let her bring it out anyways because I didn't want to make things complicated. But when she did eventually bring it out, it was covered in whipped cream. I never got much of an apology and no discount on my food, which would have made things a lot better. The whole experience just wasn't very great and I don't reccomend this location."}

Service at the bar was okay but kinda slow because they had to get the salt for my Margarita and that took longer than it should've.  There were vacant seats at the bar and a couple took a pair of seats to my left and the gentleman waited until I got my drink so he wouldn't crowd me.  Another lady swooped in and was rude, bumping and crowding me unapologetically so she could have the vacant seat I opted to not be sitting in while I got my order.
I was very glad to get away from that scene.
The hostesses got us a table in just over five minutes and seated us promptly.  There was a lot of activity there on this particular day because everyone realized at the last minute that today was the last day for half price cheesecake.  
Our waitress was sweet and kinda adorable too with her positive approach, bringing me water without asking, and helping to select menu options for hubby and myself.  I couldn't decide on dinner and asked for her to give me a recommendation.  
I went with a salad, I think it was their version of an Asian salad but truly I just can't remember.  I had asked if there was a salad with strawberries and chicken and what she suggested is the one I had, but she got the kitchen to add strawberries so it was more to my liking.  Excellent.
And hubbies pasta was served up as he had requested too.  Very nice.
French fries that were supposed to be part of my sons meal were overlooked and didn't make it to the table until he was almost done with his sandwich.
And the manager actually stopped by to apologize for the French fry oversight too.
Here we were enjoying each others company and the food, discussing the day and such -not at all in a fuss about the overlooked FF, so it was a surprise to have him check in on us.
It seems the spicy chicken sandwich he ordered was not what he had hoped for because it didn't have enough spice to really qualify as "spicy", but otherwise he said it was good.
Now the cheesecakes, omg, there are so many options it's difficult to decide.
I went with my first impression and got the Mango and Key Lime.  Not being a fan of Key Lime pie I wasn't so thrilled with that part but thought the Mango might make the Key Lime a nice blend.  Eh, not the case.  I felt I was eating a Key Lime with Mango cheesecake.
Still good and after a couple bites with some coffee I decided I should have the rest packed up and it was time to go.

Prompt seating even through there was a huge crowd.
Really good service, but the times I've been here before I guess this is standard and to be expected.
Yummy meal that was ordered up with specific instructions and delivered as such."}

The female manager was quite horrible though. Was ready to come back again soon because it was such a great experience but the manager made me change my mind. To the manager: if your staff represents a deal as being a certain way, and the patrons have already eaten the food, you have to honor the representation (especially when possible discrepancies had been brought up AND clarified before ordering). You cannot show up after the food has been eaten and say you can't honor the deal. Yes you can honor it, and you just embarrassed a patron, your waiter, and yourself by that useless confrontation.

Everyone was very friendly and eager to answer any questions we had as this was our first visit.   

The food was outstanding.  Great seasoning and excellent combination of flavors.  We started with the lobster potstickers, which were very good and u highly recommend.  My girlfriend ordered the scallops and pork belly and they were very tender and cooked perfectly.  I ordered the Braised Short Ribs. Wow they were delicious, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  The mash that came with them was just as excellent and the broccolini and carrots were simple yet a nice touch.  

We had mentioned we were there to celebrate an early birthday, and even though it still wasn't her bday Roy's still brought us a dessert and even took our picture from their camera and printed us a photo.

I've eaten at several Roy's, not probably in 5 years, but took my girls here for their first time for valentines and was definitely disappointed. The server was very nice and i don't fault him, but the kitchen definitely messed up this evening. Prix Fixe menu should make it easier to get people in/out with good food, but that was the opposite. The apps were good, but the next dish of soup and salad took forever. This is not the dish that should take a long time. Salad was the same temp as the soup, why wasn't the Caesar chilled and just waiting to add dressing? For the price I expect something other than bland non-seasoned white bread for croutons. Just seemed weird for a nice restaurant. The main dish was ok, wife's was amazing, mine which was the most expensive option was mediocre at best. The desert was ok, except the red velvet cake which taste worse than store bought. Cake was not soft and moist and very average frosting. Not what I expected when you say you have a master pastry chef. Small detail, but still frustrating, nice restaurants need to taste their water. When you serve water and don't ask if you'd like bottle or filtered than I expect the water to not have a bad after taste. This is an easy fix and overlooked. It took about 2 hours for dinner, about 15 min was our fault, but not worth the wait.

Last night I spent the same money for 3 people at another restaurant. We had more food, more drinks, and everyone loved their dining experience and couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. Had I known how far Roy's had fallen I would have taken my family to the place I went last night instead to ensure they had a special evening."}

Maybe they just wanted us to take in the fabulousness of the deli area some more and get impressed.

We were seated in about ten minutes. Not the cleanest area, but the service people were nice and we liked the pickles.  About ten minutes after ordering, food came.  My daughter was a big fan of the hamburger.  My wife liked her sandwich and fried.  The pastrami sandwich was good, though I admit I had to use a fork and knife because bread simply lacks the structural integrity to handle so much meat.

I will give it another chance, but at these prices it better be that "one bad meal"- or I'm done paying 100.00 for dinner here.

Decided to splurge for my birthday, so made a reservation for Sat night. Party of 1. 

Waiter was good enough, nice guy. He did give me a good recommendation on wine for my second glass. I was happy with him overall. 

Their "signature dish" Misoyaki Butterfish" is one I have loved - and ordered every third time I came- for probably 20 years now. 

I ordered lobster pot stickers, and they were very overcooked; slightly burned around the edges and slightly tough to chew. This is NOT how pot stickers are supposed to be- and I've loved them previously. (See photo) 

Not wanting to start my birthday dinner off negatively, I just ate them and moved on- waiting for the yummy butterfish to come! 

The thing about the butterfish has been the delicious Wasabi sauce- slight heat, and slight sweet- that yummy wasabi flavor. 

When it came the presentation was a 10! ( see photo) . Was very impressed. My first bite though, was fishy tasting. What? I've NEVER had that happen. Looking at the bottom of that half of the fillet, I could see that dark grey color- which always means a fishy taste. I moved to the other side of the fillet (thankfully the larger side) and had no taste of fishy. Whew!  The other thing is- NO wasabi flavor at all! Just very very sweet. I had loved it BECAUSE of that wasabi kick. WTF? 

I did mention this issue  to the waiter when he came by and asked me how it was, and he DID offer right away to replace the fillet, but I decided I would just eat the good part (which was most of it) and again, not have an issue on my birthday dinner. 

By now though, I was not happy I had paid $13.00 for hard potstickers and I think it was $42.00 for the butterfish. That's a hefty price for an average size piece of fish- anywhere you eat!

The waiter was sweet to pre order the volcano lava cake for me for birthday dessert (free), and it was perfection- as it had always been. He did then tell me he had taken off the charge for the appetizer due to the butterfish issue. That was decent I felt. 

With tip ( generous) it was still 130.00! (2 glasses of wine included) 
I think I hit a bad night- the chef/ staff was certainly off. 

I will come back- but I will NEVER again order the butterfish. The sauce change alone gives me reason to avoid it. 

One more "fair" $130.00 dinner and I won't be back again. 
I hope that doesn't happen.

UPDATE!!! Just ran across another review from late 2017 that complained the butterfish was gray and fishy on the bottom. I don't feel like I'm being overly picky now! Whew!"}

The decor is New York inspired and has the feel of a diner. There is a baker on one side and seating in the other. 

When you enter there are refreshments and bread with some type of spread. I assume this is for when there are long waits, by we didn't get a chance to try them. We were seated and our orders were taken pretty quickly.  

The coffee was very delicious. It was very hot and strong. Our waitress was attentive and even took our trash that accumulated from preparing our coffee. *My boyfriend and I both noticed it as one of our pet peeves is waiters who let sugar packet and tiny creamer pots pile up. :) 

The food was underwhelming. I ordered the buffalo eggs benedict. The bread it is served on was too hard and cold to enjoy, the hollandaise sauce was plain with the exception of a drizzle of buffalo sauce. My boyfriend selected a steak skillet breakfast. He really enjoyed it but the bagel given on the side was disappointing. He asked for a chives spread and was given cream cheese with chunks of chives. 

At the end of breakfast we unlocked the cookie offer and were positively surprised. 

Might be back but will definitely be trying something else. Overall this place deserves a 3.5 star rating."}

The huevo ranchero was decent but nothing spectacular. I would suggest skipping the ice coffee as well. The worst part was my sister in law asked if they had anything vegan and they suggested making her a skillet with different types of vegetables but when it was given to her it had cheese so she couldn't even eat it. The only reason I am giving them three stars is because they had some of the best bagels I have ever tried and their cream cheese with chives was amazing. Other then that I would not return here unless it was to grab a bagel to go."}

Their bagels are amazing - soft on the inside, just a bit crisp on the outside, and well seasoned. Beware though, if you get cream cheese, they will give you enough for 3-4 people! Their bread is also great, love their Jewish rye and pumpernickel. If I want to indulge for breakfast, I'll get the corned beef hash, which is made in house and is great! 

I get their matzoh ball soup anytime I am sick or if I'm missing my mom's cooking. Their sandwiches are delicious and outrageously large, and I love their house-made chips. The Jewish sliders are so yummy, definitely a guilty pleasure. My one disappointment was coming here for a pre-fixe Passover dinner one year - the food was all mediocre and just made me more homesick for a good holiday meal. But for a regular meal out, there is something here for everyone."}

I was super impressed with the overall operation of this place. 
This is my first visit to any cheesecake factory, and it was an excellent experience.
I feel i should mention, i was there to have dinner with my wife and daughter, and i had no time restrictions. I wasnt in a hurry. I wasnt looking at the clock. I also wasnt worried about the cost. It seems petty, to me,to worry about dollars and cents when spending time with people you like. So my experience is based solely on what happened, and no outlying factors.
We were seated promptly, and greeted by a friendly, nice looking server( i wanna say her name was rachel?, but like i said, i was here for family time) all of the staff appear clean, in clean uniforms, and nice looking. Drink orders, warm bread , blah, blah ,blah. Waitress was super patient when we werent ready to order, she seemed relaxed, and not at all hurried, even though the dining room is ENORMOUS. So we ordered. shrimp with angel hair and asparagus for me, chicken somethin for my wife, and plain burger for my kid. It was all good. Asparagus was perfectly cooked, uniform in color, crisp, but chewable. Pasta was 'al dente', which is exeptionally difficult to acheive in a commercial restaurant. 
Now, i honestly couldnt tell you how long the food took, or how long we were there, or what the servers attitude was like, because I WASNT LOOKING for those things. In my opinion, if your in a hurry, or concerned with your funds, maybe a table service restaurant isnt your best choice.
In conclussion:
As a professional in the restaurant industry myself, i was extremely pleased with my experience here, and i will go so far as to say, "cheesecake factory is pulling it off"."}

My server was nice but i think she forgot about me once my food came out but no worries. I dont need the attention. As for the food... UGH! Horrible. Ordered the carbonara with chicken and it was bland! The noodles were soggy and the chicken was boiled and was dry. I probably used a tablespoon of salt just to add flavor.

I've always loved Cheesecake factory for a lot of reasons, and have yet to find a reason to NOT love it here.  They have such a great menu selection, the decor is always nice, and I love how theres tons of space to dine, socialize and hang out.

Anyways, I got there first so we could get a seat.  It was busy, but thats not a surprise since it was a Friday night.  The girls at the counter were nice and friendly, and told me the wait was only going to be about 15 minutes.  (not bad!)  They gave me a buzzer and I waited in the lobby area for Andrea.

Anyways, I was seating rather quickly, which was nice!  Our server was friendly and cool, and immediately asked what we would like to drink. I got some water, and Andrea got some Iced Tea.

We studied the menu for  a minute, and I ended up getting the shepards pie.  I could really have almost any one of thier dinners here, and find that I will like what they serve me regardless.  I love the variety!  

Anyways, I was happy becuase I felt like our server was available, and even tho it was busy, she didnt make me feel like that, and that was awesome!

Anyways, I still love this place and its just awesome.  Great place to bring anyone! Parents, dates, friends, whatever.   I really don't think you can go wrong here."}

My salad seemed to be a smaller portion (they have summer portion of what I ordered) but they charged me the full amount.  It was average at best.  I thought the salad used to be served with some garlic toast or bread but nothing but the salad in a small white bowl was provided. 

The one star comes from what they served my 9 year old. She ordered french toast with bacon. They served her one slice of bread made into french toast and cut in half.  That's it! Literally a single piece of bread and water for $4.99!  Seems a little ridiculous?!  We asked for the bacon that was included which they brought 5 minutes later. I complained about the portion so we were given another piece of french toast bread.  My 7 year old ate the 3 chicken strips which were good.

Chompies has always been known for their generous portions so this was very disappointing!  The restaurant was empty so I would guess they are working on cost savings by providing less food.  Service was slow for an empty restaurant.  

PS - The pickles were all mushy and gross.  Not at all Chompies standard.

I expect this location will shut down soon....that bad!"}

We all had various combinations of the shellfish and salmon, and all were perfectly cooked and flavorful. For dessert, you will want to try their flourless chocolate soufflé.

Tonight, though the food was good, we were sorely disappointed with the latter. 

Our server did not smile once throughout the entire dinner, and he frequently seemed annoyed with us. I don't ask that servers are constantly cheerful, but this particular waiter's demeanor was sour enough to cast a cloud over the whole experience. He would ask the requisite questions, but always with a disdainful look on his face. He also seemed irritated that we didn't order any drinks, and he all but snatched our wine glasses away. 

Specifically, a few other things stand out among the general attitude of displeasure he displayed. We ordered the mango streusel dessert (from the prix fixe menu), and he brought out a pineapple dish and called it "apple pecan... eh... thing." We didn't realize it was the wrong dessert until we dug into it, so we didn't say anything. Then, when it was time to pay, we wanted to use two gift cards plus a credit card to cover his tip. We had some confusion about how to do this, and he seemed really impatient when we asked questions. Then, when we said we would think about how we wanted to split things up, he backed away with his hands up and stomped away. Lastly, when we had paid and wanted to double check that we had properly written everything out on the receipt, he just snapped, "That's fine." Again, I didn't expect him to fawn over us, but considering that we were trying to tip him (generously, might I add, given his rudeness throughout the night), he could have shown a little patience or at least said thank you. 

I want to give the server the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was having a bad day, but it's really a shame that the good food and atmosphere were tainted by his unpleasant behavior. Next time my family wants to enjoy a nice dinner, we will probably choose a restaurant where we can expect a server who doesn't sneer at us.

Edit: The manager saw my original review (above) and called to get more feedback. This impressed me and showed that Roy's really cares about its customers, and Emiliano was nothing but courteous and understanding when I spoke with him. He even sent a $50 certificate for our next visit. I really appreciate that he reached out and will be sure to try Roy's again soon."}

I had different servers picking up my plates and asking how things were going, it seemed like they were working as a team. 

I got the butter fish plate with the black rice. A bit to strong taste for me, didn't love it. But salad/dessert absolutely delicious. I'm sure if I got the steak or sushi I would've liked the meal a lot more. Again, know what you are ordering."}

The bad: When we arrived, it was probably a normal lunch crowd, full but with a handful of open tables. Hostess was really bad - barely acknowledged us and only mumbled. The hostess kept walking away and returning and pretty much refused to make eye contact. Seemed very strange and rude. And we weren't the only ones waiting that were irritated. Took quite a while to be seated. Once we were sat, the table and chairs were filthy. Hostess return to wipe it, but shouldn't have bothered. Eventually got someone else to clean the table off. 

The good: Ordered sliders, a side salad, and the roasted tomato/mushroom/goat cheese salad and they were all delicious and large portions. They also brought us blueberry muffin/cake before our food came and it was delicious too. Manager ended up bringing us some cookies and they were quite yummy too. 

Our waitress was very good and attentive, so hopefully the hostess and the cleanliness issue was a fluke. Will update my review if we return and this changes."}

The chicken tortilla soup was very hearty with big chunks of chicken and fried tortillas. There were also chunks of potato and onion. I'm a huge soup fan, even if it's 105 in Phoenix, and this was definitely tasty  

The turkey dinner was very dry. Since it took a while for the food to come out, I think it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The sautéed spinach was delicious but I enjoyed the latkes better, very crispy with moist inside and flavored with onion and garlic.  The stuffing was dry and the gravy needed some spices. 

My sisters corned beef and cabbage was outstanding!  The meat was so tender and melted like butter. I should have stuck with the Jewish food."}

Have heard so many good things about this place from friends, even Adam Richmond (Man vs Food) said it was good. Where to start....I love a good rueben so I ordered the Granpa Rudy with corned beef instead of pastrami, $14.99. The most tastless sandwhich I have ever eaten. The corned beef had NO flavor at all, the cheese was tastless and I am not sure if it even had dressing. It doesn't matter how much corned beef you pile on a sandwich, if it's tastless all you have is a big pile of tastless meat! My gf ordered the sliders. Again the brisket (I think thats what it was suppose to be) was bland as anything, the gravy was so heavy it ruined everything and the potato cakes were burnt, greasy and tasted like they were old. I even took some photos but refuse to post them and give Chompies free advertising. This was a "been-there-done-that" moment. Won't be back."}

For an entree I got the the original combo or whatever
It came with small portions of ahi, salmon, and butterfish

This is the #1 spot for real bagels here in Arizona, in my opinion. Make no mistake, I am not talking about the bagels that are sold in the supermarket.  They are not the same.  They must be made somewhere differently, because they taste nothing like the ones from the actual restaurant. They also have fantastic cream cheese varieties. We get the veggie one often but have also tried the plain, and chive and are all really good and fresh. If you are going to eat there, expect a wait if it is a prime time, and super friendly service. I would recommend breakfast fare (it's all good!) or if it is lunch time, go for the typical Jewish deli stuff like matzo ball soup (so good!) or a reuben sandwich. Those items really stick out as special to me, and are not easy to find here in Arizona. It is a great place where you can get whatever you are craving and everything is good. They give the kids a cookie with their meal which my kids totally appreciate.  Not fast though, be patient! Also, you can order egg sandwiches from the bagel area and they are delicious.  Gives me a little taste of the east coast which I love."}

I had the absolute worst experience in a very long time.  To be honest, the Butterfish was pretty good, but it should be at $38 dollars.  Here is where Roy's fell completely apart for us. The server was absolutely terrible, I told him that this was our first time at Roy's, but that didn't appear to matter. He never introduced himself, never told us about the specials and had a unpleasant attitude the entire time.  I overheard the server behind us introduce himself, being very professional, and explaining the menu in detail.  I can't remember the last time I didn't leave 20% gratuity, but quite frankly, the server "Brandon" deserved 0% and additional training. I'm not some kind of food snob, but Introducing yourself, and assisting the customer "who is a first time guest" isn't asking very much. We moved to Arizona 18 month ago, and Roy's left a terrible taste in my mouth. Awful Experience!

We didn't have to wait to be seated which is really surprising since this place is always packed. The hostess showed us to our table, and as we were sitting down, a waitress very rudely came to the table and told the hostess that someone was already sitting there. The hostess said it was okay to sit there anyway, so my boyfriend and I started looking at the menu. The waitress who said that someone was already sitting there was literally giving us the evil eye. The hostess came back a few minutes later and asked us if we would mind moving to another booth because there were other people who were waiting for that booth first. If that was the only problem we had, I wouldn't be writing this review, but it got worse from there. 

Our waitress was very nice and pleasant, and she in no way contributed to our horrible experience. We ordered our food at 6:45pm. I ordered the chicken maderia and my boyfriend ordered the Moroccan chicken. We waited and waited for our food, and at 7:15 a manager came to our table and said that an "overwhelming amount of people ordered pasta" and because the Moroccan chicken came with kous kous, our food would be delayed. She said something like 300 people ordered pasta and the kitchen couldn't keep up. I've never heard of this happening before. She said it would be a little longer until we got our food, but it ended up being another half an hour before our food came. I'm sorry, but waiting an hour for 2 meals is not acceptable.

The wait wasn't bad at all, maybe ten minutes tops. After being seated we were provided the complimentary bread & water. We both opted to trying a mixed drink off the menu: Whiskey Smash & the Ultimate Margarita. The Smash wasn't terrible, had decent flavor but did taste a little watered down after a few sips. The Margarita, however, was terrible- tasted purely of margarita mix & nothing else; pretty much had to force it down- no sense in wasting a $10 drink. We also ordered the Corn Tamale Cakes as an appetizer. These were kinda weird; flavor was more sweet than anything. There are 3 cakes to a plate, I barely finished one and we didn't even touch the third.

Our visit thus far was mediocre, but we decided to still order entrees. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken  Gumbo which was no gumbo at all. I grew up eating gumbo & have always known it to have a broth to make it almost like a soup; this was just gloopy and mush. There was absolutely no flavor, the shrimp was overcooked & extremely chewy and the rice was still hard. I took a few bites and couldn't force anymore down. It was gross. 

My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair. The description talks about all this lemon, garlic flavor with some marinara sauce. This "meal" had absolutely no flavoring. It seemed like they made the pasta, threw a hefty helping of bruschetta tomatoes on top and threw on 5 pieces of overcooked shrimp to it & charged us $17.95. There was no sauce, no lemon/herb flavor. My boyfriend took 2 bites and pushed it to the side. It was terrible. 

We immediately asked for our check & our server didn't even ask if everything was alright or if there was anything she could do. Nope, she just dropped our check off and that was that, even after seeing the full plates of food still. An $89 meal that was beyond basic and left us both feeling disappointed, frustrated and hungry."}

Horrible deli counter service.  This is the second time I've visited since its grand opening at the end of May.  

I was really excited as other locations I've visited were fantastic.  Unfortunately, both of my visits have left me unimpressed.

The first visit, we requested a booth. While we were happy to wait for one, they seated us at a table despite several gentle reminders of our request.  

We ordered breakfast, an all American and a two egg breakfast.  The service was slow and apathetic. The food was served lukewarm.

Well, we all have our off days so I figured we'd try again and see if things would be better this time around. 

Unfortunately, it was a bit worse with the exception of our server. The food was served late, cold and with hard bagels.  

Despite this, I love their bagels so after we choked down our breakfast, we headed to the deli counter to pick up some to take home.  While waiting patiently, we were ignored  and passed over 3 separate times. It took a total of roughly 22 minutes to get 6 bagels.  When we were finally served, it was with all the hospitality of Lurch. Sorry to put you out there, buddy. 

Anyway, it will be an unlikely event that I will return.

I then got a mango martini sans the mint. Oh my goodness also too addicting! So great and bubbly.  I tried their specialty drink that was infused in pineapple for 2 weeks. It was pretty good. If you like coconut you'll like this. 

We got the sampler plate. It was OK.  It had sushi, spring rolls, ribs and other food. 

I had the Mahi Mahi for dinner. It was great.  Not fishy tasting at all. One negative to the dish was the side dishes. It came with asparagus and sliced potatoes.  The potatoes were so disappointing because they were flavorless and tasted a bit too hard. Besides that the dish was very good with extremely flavorful sauce. 

We had pineapple upside down cake and the lava cake for dessert. The pineapple upside down was nothing worth writing home about. It didn't have very much flavor to it.  I've made a box mix pineapple cake that tasted better. It didn't even have that classic sugar crispness that you normally get from the brown sugar.  The lava cake was scrumptious. I do have to say the one negative about it was the raspberry sauce. It didn't taste good. The chocolate cake was still very good and very sweet.  

This place is definitely a special occasions kind of place as it is quite pricey."}

After seeing their menu here on yelp i was very excited (have you seen the size of those pancakes??!) and so was my husband because he's gluten-free. 

So i got the dippin sandwich. I'm torn between $16 for a sandwich???? and $16 for a sandwich plus fries piled high with excellent quality brisket. Tough call. But admittedly the meat WAS dry; it's good it came with au jus because it would've been too dry alone. My grandpa liked the pierogis (he's had better he said, not enough cheese i think) but my grandma RAVED over the tender sauce smothered cabbage rolls. 

My husband got the pastrami on a gf roll and he LOVED it!! He also tried the liver & onions for the first time and he said it was very good too. 

Our waiter was funny, polite, didnt get anything wrong and knew who ordered what. Refills were on time & correct. I would come back! Too bad they arent everywhere.

They gave me a regular menu so I had to specifically ask for a happy hour menu which I feel should be given automatically during happy hour along w the regular menu. Orrr at least ask if I'd like the happy hour menu. 

For happy hour some Drinks $5.95, some apps $5.95 and small plates range from $5.95-9 give or take. 

I got the JW Pink Lemonade. Which is my absolute absolute favorite drink. Soo delicious, perfect blend of sweet and tart. But the calories would make me sway away from it if I have never had it or if I'm watching my caloric intake, but it was a long day so I'm my head i said "treat yo self"

For food I got the sausage ricotta flatbread. It has sausage, ricotta, herbs, kale, and mozz(I believe). Tastes good, smaller than I hoped but it was good. 

Service was alright. They asked if I wanted bread, said yes but they forgot. Prob didn't need the extra calories but I did want it. 

Also don't ask them for recommendations. They always say everything "is good just depends what you like". Feel like they aren't honest. Just saying that whatever you ask about tastes good. Would like an honest opinions but guess that's their job."}

1,560 calories and 84g of fat for their carrot cake, and 1080 cal, 71g fat, and 100 carbs for a slice of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake.  And those are far from being the only unhealthy items on the menu. Seemingly innocent entrees like salads and sugar free cheesecake can also be calorie-packed diet-wreckers. For example, rumor has it that The Cheesecake Factory's Chinese Chicken Salad clocks in at about 1,600 whopping calories. And the 6 Carb Original Cheesecake has 610 calories and 57g of fat.

3 people, 2 meals that were good. We were told the food came to the table cold and raw (eggs) because we were sitting under the AC?? My plate was hot (mysteries of he AC workings, I guess ACs pick and choose what to air condition) and the other 2 plates cold.

2 of 3 plates sent back for being cold and eggs raw. Bald manager came out and was nice about it. Nice guy. Second order came out, and hollandaise on one plate was gross and thick and oh yeah, food cold. Complained to a different manager who rudely asked, "What do you want me to do about it? It all came out of the pot that way."
Asked if he could take it off the bill and just charge for the egg that was eaten.

Waitress came over and explained that the bill was discounted, then when questioned said we could just see the bill (she had no clue). Turned out they took the one meal off.

Overall attitude. Place is going waaay down in customer service. We used to eat there once a week and now, it's been more difficult to justify the return each time.

On the plus side, I had pumpkin cranberry pancakes and they were excellent and weirdly enough HOT the entire meal. Like I said, the AC must have avoided my plate and skipped to the others'."}

I'm writing a review based on this recent visit (last night) that just sucked. We were sat down right away which was the only plus I'll give them because normally it takes a couple of minutes or more to get a seat but this time we did get a seat fast. 

Let me say the biggest complaint is how cold it was in the restaurant, it was an ice box! Even my husband was freezing, we couldn't enjoy our time there to want to stay past the dinner to get cheesecake it was so cold! Our drive home we rode with the windows down having to thaw out! I get you have so many bodies in the place and workers moving a lot but that was absolutely horrible how cold it was! 

Another huge complaint was our server, I'm guessing Cheesecake Factory Just doesn't care about who they have as servers anymore because each time we have come in now, we have horrible service and it's a shame since we do love their cheesecake and food. Our server came by and took our order never said his name. We waited 15 minutes to even get bread, which he didn't even bring us the manager did after I asked her when she helped another table. But the sad part was a table who was sat after us received bread before we did. Once we got bread it was only brown bread and no sour dough because they ran out and was making more. Once we got our appetizer our waiter never came to check back on us for refills or to ask how the appetizer tasted. Then once we got our food again never came back to ask how our food was noting. And to mention he only had three tables including us. 

The final complaint is how the food was just not tasteful at all. I always get the chicken piccata and last night it tasted so bland just no flavor at all. Last nights visit was so disappointing I think we will be taking a long break from Cheesecake Factory for a while."}

Had planned to partake in Fleming's happy hour (had a giftcard), but came here instead when I saw how busy it was at the bar (and I didn't want to sit outside in the heat).  I knew Roy's had a quasi-HH (free edamame-- what kind of HH is that?), so I had resigned to have Roy's tasty Waimanolo (sp?) salad.  Surprise, surprise!  Roy's now offers four food items (ahi tuna, calamari, Wagyu sliders, and beef skewers!), as well as a few wines by the glass and ALL of its signature cocktails during happy hour for $5 each!  I've tried the skewers before and wasn't too impressed, but I knew the calamari was very good, so I didn't go for that (even though I really wanted to have some).  No, what I had my eye on were the Wagyu beef sliders, w/ caramelized onions and, wait... what else did I read?  Sweet potato fries??  Oh, yeah!  My name was all over this dish!  I also placed an order for chardonnay, but I changed my mind when I saw that I could try another of Roy's signature drinks-- the last ones I'd tried many, many months ago were my espresso martini and a friend's lemon martini I'd sampled.  I was doubly-excited when I spotted Roy's Hawaiian take on the classic sidecar!  This happy hour was going to be FUN!

The Fred and Ginger cocktail did NOT disappoint!  It contained Hennessy VS cognac and Domaine du Canton ginger liqueur w/ a candied ginger peel garnish served in a martini glass.  It was beautiful to behold and so very delicious to sip!  'Twas a shame I couldn't finish the whole drink-- had to save some room for the sliders and fries (and the dessert I hadn't even planned on having later on!).  I really liked the sliders-- there were two of them, one on either side of the mini-Chinese takeout box filled w/ seasoned crispy sweet potato fries.  The sliders tasted like Whoppers (back in its heyday in the early 80's) kicked up several notches (LOVED the crispy/chewy pretzel buns!), and the fries were seasoned w/ herbs and even had a bit of cheese drizzle here and there!  I would definitely order the cocktail and app again, and for $5 each, they're a steal!  

(I almost did not want to yelp about Roy's happy hour, bec. I wanted to keep this a secret for a little while.)

Thinking back, the cocktail and app would've been enough to satisfy me for the rest of the day, but I didn't really want to leave Roy's just yet ( had planned to write a review or two), so I broke down and decided to try the Chocolate souffle ($9.95), Roy's take on the chocolate lava cake, but w/ homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a raspberry coulis.  This item is baked to order, so if you are on a time limit, you should place your order in early, as it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmm...  I liked the outer edges of the chocolate cake, which had the chewiness of a soft, fresh-baked brownie.  The lava center was definitely gooey and rich, and it tasted like hot brownie batter.  I think I'd have enjoyed the cake and its lava center a lot more if the accompanying vanilla ice cream was of a better quality.  I didn't care for its texture (not creamy enough), nor its flavor (vanilla bean specks were absent and the vanilla essence wasn't strong enough).  This dish cost as much as the app and cocktail combined, and I didn't think it was worth the price.

Can't wait to go back here for HH w/ friends!"}

I had ordered it with gravy on the side so sadly it was too dry for me, but maybe some salsa would have helped. The restaurant was packed, but that didn't affect the service time which is a win in my book! The day old bread they sell is amazing and be sure to stop by the bakery for a treat to go before you leave."}

It would take 2 min. 15 min later my food came out.

I asked to talk to a manager at this point. It was our first time there and based on what had happened this far we weren't coming back.

We called ahead for a reservation and were seated right on time. Our server was very prompt, and took a moment to go over the menu since we were "first timers". We started with the lobster potstickers. They were fantastic. Substantial lobster filling and light enough to leave room for our entrees. I was struggling with what to order so our server told us the chef could do a split plate with two entrees. It was the perfect solution, and very unique compared to other restaurants. 

I had the blackened ahi and the prosciutto wrapped ono. Both were perfectly cooked. The ahi was spicier than I had anticipated, but very flavorful with great texture. The Ono was the better of the two dishes. Light with a great buttery flavor, and the prosciutto didn't overpower the flavor of the fish. My wife had the scallops. There were four large diver scallops in the order. The had a wonderful crispy sear, but were perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was very savory as well with great flavor. 

We finished with the chocolate soufflé. it was very light, but rich at the same time. Word to the wise, pre order this if you're thinking about it for dessert. Ours came about 10 minutes after we finished our entrees because we pre ordered. A couple next to us didn't, and they were waiting for theirs even though they finished their entrees before we did. 

Overall a great experience and we'll definitely go back. We'd love to make it in time for the happy hour and try some of the appetizer and cocktail specials."}

Our first visit about two weeks ago went well and we very happy with the food and the service. We went back yesterday and have no idea what happened. Our food was terrible and service mediocure . When we arrived there was only one couple there. the soup special was Albondigas , a Mexican soup I have eaten and made many times in my life, so I was excited. I ordered the white fish salad half sandwich with soup and my son ordered the mile high Pastramie with fries. My meal: the fish salad was the worst I ever had. The consistency was like a cream cheese smear with no flavor just fishy and salty It was like they put every thing through a blender (Terrible). The bread was cold like it was prevously in a fridge. Worse than the sandwich was the soup. It had no  semblance to Albondigas except it had a meatball in it. It had a thick tomato base broth with potatoes and carrots. I even called the server to see if they had made a mistake. She said no that it was the Albondigas. I realize a Jewish deli may not be the best place for Albondigas but if they don't know how to make it they should not make it a feature soup of the day. That was my meal now for my sons meal. His Pastrami sandwich liked like a pyramid. Meat was all in the middle only to make it tall and none on the sides, made it only a third sandwich at best. The Pastrami was cold and dry. Again the bread was cold. Even worse the fries looked like they were left over, kinda grey looking and again cold. In addition there was only one couple there, already eating and it took 25 minutes to get our meal. I would never go back nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone."}

We are regulars at many locations... The grande burrito is my go to usually and is actually quite wonderful with the secret sauce. 

I would give most locations 4-5 stars but for whatever reason both my visits to this location shared the same experience of drier than normal food with almost non of that wonderful secret sauce....

These places are usually packed as this one was and that is fine. For some reason this location seemed so loud though that both times I left with a headache...

I recommend the other locations above this one.... You have read why...."}

Now I'm not giving this place a 2 star because of that, my food was just not good. I ordered the white chili chicken, it sounded good to me so I wanted to try it. The waitress came with our food (she was really nice and her service was great). My food came out cold and not very good. The chili was mush with a little bit of rice, some beans, and chicken. I would have asked the waitress if I could get my food reheated but I was starving so I ate it anyways. 
Not the best experience but we will stick to our normal location."}

We went for date night before going to the movies because it is one of the places that offers a deal for restaurant week.  Instead of bread, they give edamame seasoned with sea salt, brown sugar, and togarashi (?) oh my are they addicting! The lobster potstickers were good even though there were only 3 of them, the sizzling beef app was tasty, but not worth $14.  The macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, YUM!  I would even pay the asking price for that!.  Even the blueberry  cheesecake was light and fluffy.

Roy's has their own cookbook and I would highly recommend purchasing it. Most of the recipes are relatively easy to make.

It's a fantastic place if you need a good variety menu. They literally have everything as far as type of food goes. I couldn't imagine them not having something for a very picky person.

This place is busy, and for good reason I'm sure. Customer service is good about 60% of the time. I think it really depends on who you luck out with. Or perhaps I may have just gotten a new trainee a couple of times. Long story short, we've been admittedly forgotten about at our table on 2 different occasions. I thought this was kind of odd. Took about 1 hour and 45 minutes from sitting down to finishing our food. Clearly this is uncommon and a mistake. Mistakes happen, I get it. This is unfortunately why I can't give this place a higher rating just yet. 

Cheesecake is of course wonderful, along with the rest of their menu. I haven't tried any drinks, but they also have a plentiful amount of what to choose from. 

Its in a great location, right by the mall. This could also be why its very busy at around Dinner times. Its close to me, so I'm sure I'll be back in the near future to try and get this to a higher rating! :)

Appies and cocktails (extra pts for having "skinny cocktails") for $5 each. You simply must try this place! 

Then...come back for dinner sometime when you feel like throwing down some serious cash for some seriously good eats.

I took a friend there last night as a "thank you for watching my dog while I was on vacation dinner" (her choice but I was totally IN) and she was SO happy! We started with cocktails: the Mango Mojito was nice but expensive but I REALLY enjoyed the equally pricey Coconut Frappe off the "Lifestyle--Under 150 calories" Menu. That little taste of cinnamon was inspired! And the sweetness really set off the salted/garlic edamame which is complimentary (such a nice alternative to bread, which always fills you up too much to enjoy your meal, no?).

We then proceeded to taste everything on each other's plates so I can personally attest to their 3-course Prix Fixe menu (app/entre/dessert for $37)--she chose the Pan-Seared Trout over Black Couscous (not fishy at all, a bit dry for my taste), the Dim Sum (which was nice but I needed a bit more of the Shiso Herb Purée, which was deelish), and of course the Chocolate Souffle (perfectly rich!). I opted for the Trio, which was on a Yelp special for 30% off ($24 instead of $36, yay! more $ for cocktails!) and featured a sampling of 3 of their most popular fish dishes: the Teriyaki Grilled Salmon (yum), the Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi (double yum!) and the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish (triple yum!!). I can't believe I ate it all! And that's after splitting a Grilled Pear Salad w/ spicy walnuts and blue cheese (dressing was divine!)...whew!

In addition to all this gastric happiness we experienced, our service (from greeter/hostess to waiter to table-busser) was wonderful. Attentive, prompt, suggestive and friendly. 

A wonderful evening!"}

I'd never been here, and bought a groupon on a whim. A buddy from work came with me, and gave me the rundown. I thought this place was like Blimpie's (yeah, that old place). It's not.

We sat down, my buddy ordered a half sandwich with fries, and I went Breakfast (heck yeah, all day breakfast!). By "breakfast", I mean Chicken Fried Steak with Gravy, Eggs, Hash Browns (really good), and a blueberry bagel (choose the bagel here, it's awesome).  Our big worry was that we would end up late for our meeting after lunch, but they got us our food pretty quickly.

The Half Sandwich was pretty much the size of a Toddler's head. The meal in front of me nearly made me nod off in the aforementioned meeting, being so huge and delicious. That sausage gravy set the whole thing off, and the bagel ended up a nice dessert.

After that awesome meal, we ended up only a dollar over our 20 dollar Groupon (both went with waters), and got back in time for our nap... er... meeting."}

However my husband got the Trio as did another person and they felt the Butter Fish was great but the other two fish selections were just mediocre.

She even delivered the check while we were still eating dessert. Without alcohol the bill for two people was $125.00 so it's truly a commitment to eat there.

Its not health-friendly.
Its not ideal for vegetarians.

So if you're budget-minded, health-conscious, or a vegetarian...this isn't the place for you.

That being said, I love this place.  Sure the waits on Saturday nights suck, but that's how it is any place you might venture into unless its a little known gem.  But for me, the wait is completely worth it.  I eat whatever the heck I wanna eat, no matter how much heavy cream is in the sauce or how much sugar is in the desert or how much fried is in the fried whatever.  And yeah, I pay for it around the midsection but hey.

Anyhow, the service has always been good, even close to closing time.   Bad service once in awhile is inevitable, and I'm sure I'll receive it here sooner or later, but so far we've been fortunate.  Whether we have a large party or just a couple of us, our food has come out in a timely manner each visit.  And none of us have had cold dishes.
One of my cousins even changed her order after she got the first one and didn't like it...the waitress didn't even skip a beat.

So far, I've had mostly pasta/rice dishes.  My favorite dish here at the moment is the something something Gumbo.  Its oddly rich and subtle at the same time, the kind of thing that makes you keep shoveling forkfulls in your mouth just to delight at this combo.  The sauce is creamy but not too heavy with just enough kick.  Like I said its subtle, but at the same time its a great flavor experience.
Other dishes I've tried are the New Orleans shrimp something or another, and another cajun type dish.  Both were extremely tasty with HUGE shrimp, pieces of sausage or chicken or whatever was in it.  

They DO NOT skimp on the portions.  I've read that some people are actually turned off by this.  I just think that if I'm paying money to eat, I should get as much for that money as possible.  And here, you do.  Last night, we commented on how a dish that costs only $13 could be chocked full of so many big fresh shrimp.  And recently, one of the kids and his dad ordered one of the burgers...this thing was a friggin' MONSTER!  It could eat a human.  And sure it would make any health-conscious person run for the hills, but for the rest of us, this burger would make your eyes get so big your eyeballs might fall out of their sockets.  Let's just say Red Robin's burgers look like White Castles compared to this.  Sadly, this specific burger is no longer on the menu, and to custom do it, they would've charged extra.  So that wasn't cool.

And I think that is the only negative point I might have.  Seriously, I love this place.  Its only got 4 stars cause its not somewhere I can just up and say "let's go!" because of the prices.  Well......let's rethink that.  See, I HAVE to have cheesecake.  After all, it IS the Cheesecake Factory.  Its their defining thingy.  And cheesecake (plus a beverage) is what really rolls my bill over the line.  But is the cheesecake all that???  Oh my friggin goodness, yes.

I cannot speak for all the cheesecakes on the extensive menu, for I simply cannot get past the Banana whatever cheesecake.  This is just the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth.  I won't attempt to describe it, just know that if you like anything to do with bananas, this is for you.  You two were meant to meet.  Destiny.

And about that extensive menu...yeah its big.  Soooo many choices.  They've got pastas, rice dishes, platters, burgers, steaks, seafoods, pizzas (the littlest in our fam ordered a pizza and it was 2 times as big as his head)...and then of course all the appetizers, drinks, and deserts.  I don't know why someone would ever complain about a big menu.  That's beyond me.

So what else?  Uhm, its a good place for a date...although I must say there seems to be so many complete hotties here at any given time, that some unfortunate glances my inevitably happen....so be warned fellas.  I suggest you wear sunglasses.
Uhm, the bathrooms were clean each time I went.  Although this last time there was a big line....with food this rich, that is to be expected.  
Atmosphere is enjoyable.  Some people may think its a little uppity, but coming from a guy who wears jeans and a t-shirt most days, I'd have to say its ok.  A lot of the teen crowd and early 20s, but its not an obnoxious atmosphere at all.  Its a family place.

So...yeah.  If you can stand to spend about 20 bucks a person, don't care about the calories, and want some really good food and a lot of it, come."}

I usually dine at the location in Tempe and after my experience at this location probably will stick to the one in Tempe only. This was an all around poor visit. From the greeting as we walked in to the walk out the door. The atmosphere was so dull, my food was warm not hot, the service was slow, there was no attempt to make for a great visit. Everyone seemed to be so disconnected. We didn't receive silverware when we sat down and actually had to get up and get it from a station set up on a table next to use for servers to roll silverware. We also saw other tables doing that too...
The worst part about the visit was the manager's actions. He was very short when we arrived. We never saw him talking to tables. And on top of that, in the middle of our service he was in our view while outside smoking a cigarette and plying on his phone in the front of the restaurant. 
Like I said, we'll stick to one in Tempe after that."}

My husband and I went here for a date night (a rarity for us). The ambiance was lovely: Hawaiian without being like we were in a theme park. The service was attentive-- as it should be for an establishment with this price tag.

We had Lumpia (like an egg roll) for an appetizer, and it was very good. My entree was a different story though. I had the Chicken with Gorgonzola and I thought it just good-average. Dave had the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and loved it (but how can you screw up salmon?). The portions are rather small, although the presentation is very nice.

We're not accustomed to eating out so 'finely' on a week night, but this has been a rough week for dear hubby of mine and I wanted to treat him tonight.

We showed up a bit early before our reservation, so we sat at the bar and were tended by a couple of lovely gals.  I had a very delish grapefruit martini and he a Jameson... then we were taken to our table and commenced the 'feeding process'.

WOW, it's been over an hour since we ate and I'm still 'stuffed to the brim'!  Their portions were very impressive: 
Appetizer: I had the Tempura Crusted Spicy Ahi Roll appetizer, he hadthe Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs - consensus: roll was outstanding, accompanied by a fantastic buttery miso; ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor coating was finger-licking yumminess. 
Main Course: I had the Mac Nut Mahi Mahi and he had the Beef Short Ribs.. again, flavorful!  Mahi Mahi is a little too dry for me (it was cooked more rare, which should have helped this already dry meat) and besides the Lobster essence, there wasn't that much excitement going on.. no spark, no za-zamm...(BTW, HUGE portion on the Mahi Mahi).. his short ribs were scrumptious, especially with that braising sauce to smear it with... his dish was way better than my dish.
Dessert:  We tried both the Souffle and Cheesecake.. the cheesecake BY FAR outdid the Souffle.  The Souffle was just too rich and too chocolatey... unbearably so!  but the cheesecake was creamy, slightly rich but well balanced with the fats in the crumb base... ugh, so good!

Overall we enjoyed it!  Service was great and I appreciated that Roy's participated in Restaurant Week and had such impressive dishes and delivered on all ends (well, except as noted)."}

If you are in the mall and are hungry, check to see how long the wait is.  If the wait is short, give it a try.  If the wait is long, check Yelp for other options in the area."}

Went in for National Cheesecake Day for 1/2 price cheesecake and they did not disappoint! We went in late to avoid the crowds though it did a little while still to get our cheesecakes since many ppl were still seated, I'm sure getting their desserts. But once they arrived at our table all was forgotten. These cheesecakes have the most delectable flavors. I couldn't care less what their calorie content is. Everything in moderation and this is the perfect place to splurge! 

The flavors of every single piece was ABSOLUTELY perfect! I'm not much of a S'mores fan but these flavors blended so well from the sweet light crunchiness of the graham cracker crust to the delicious light airy Hershey's chocolate cheesecake to the rich chocolate ganache topping and toasted housemade marshmallow. Kahlua is my usual choice for cheesecake and was spectacular as usual. My son ordered Hershey's Chocolate Bar and it too was delicious and he even had leftovers for me to enjoy the next day! Love love LOVE!"}

We were offered a table in the bar area but what was the point of making a reservation for that.  Once we finally got to our table it was another 15 minutes before our waitress bothered showing up.  Before we could place our drink orders she disappeared.  

Once we finally got her back and placed our order, things went better. The drinks were Devine and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend their signature drink that comes in the metallic pineapple. We just had to laugh how comical the service was. If I'm going to spend over $100 for a meal, I would at least like to be waited on a little.  Hope this place can get its act together as it really does have a lot of potential."}

Service alone deserved 5 stars!  Our server didn't even bat an eyelash when I asked for specifics on dish preparations (though, she did go to the back a couple of times to get the info), and the manager even apologized for the noise coming from the bar area due to NBA basketball finals- he even offered to move us to a quieter section if that was our wish!  

We started w/ complimentary edamame, then onto the wonderful calamari http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw#nqSeC4BhUb4SVYbZlctbiw and continued w/ the Sweet Home Waimanalo salad (loved the creamy herb dressing- so tasty, we would've been happy to order a plate each and call it a night!), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw#roCbXZ4rpCLb104MFuoZOw and finally to Roy's Trio (hibachi salmon, blackened ahi, and misoyaki butterfish).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roys-restaurant-chandler?select=Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA#Y2CqA0n2v7LOl7eE2Vz8vA  For another $4, we enjoyed a serving of macadamia nut-crusted mahi mahi, too.  These beautiful servings of fish offered about three to four bites each of pure bliss!  They came w/ their own sauces: salmon/Japanese citrus ponzu; butterfish/forbidden black rice and sweet ginger wasabi; ahi/spicy soy mustard butter; mahi mahi/lobster butter.  These bites took us through varying complex, lovely, fun aromas and flavors AND textures (from melt-in-your-mouth salmon to steak-like mahi mahi!).  We enjoyed our meal so much, it didn't feel right to order dessert.  Does that make any sense to you?  I hope so, bec. I'm at a loss to explain further!

My husband and I went for breakfast to the Chandler location.  We got there at 7:30 in the morning on a Saturday.  We walk in and the hostess asked us how many in our party.  It was just the two of us and she said ok, hold on a sec.  So we waited while she went to get menus and then came back to seat us.  We were two of the maybe ten customers in the place.  Not sure why we had to wait when the place was empty.  Kinda weird.  Our waitress was very nice, took our order and was all around a great gal.  The food however was not that great today.  I ordered the Cragel Riser.  A cross between a bagel and a croissant.  There was nothing croissanty about it.  It was a bagel, period!  And a very dried out bagel at that.  It was awful.  The eggs were very dry and folded in half and you could barely find any bacon in it.  I left most of it on the plate. And it is too big for the plate.  The top part of the Cragel had to be placed on a napkin on the table, not good.  Just put it on the bigger plate!  My husband had the whole grain pancakes.  He said they were ok but the butter they gave him to put on it was in those little prepackaged squares and it was ice cold and hard as a rock.  Can ya just put some soft butter in a little cup and serve it that way!  Terrible presentation skills as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe I am watching too much Top Chef but I know how something should be served.  Cold butter on pancakes is just not good.   The coffee was decent, but that was about it.  Not sure what the deal is here but food is not good anymore.  The last time I bought the rugelah from the bakery they were stale and hard.  I complained about it when I got home and they offered to give me some new ones.  For 15.00 bucks a pound they should be fresh and tasty.  Now I know why I won't go back, unless the food improves immensely.  They just have too much on the menu to have good consistent quality food."}

My favorite dish on the menu is the herb crusted salmon. It's served over mashed potatoes with grilled asparagus. I've ordered this before during both lunch and dinner. I would say the serving is comparably the same amount; however, lunch is significantly less priced.

I felt I had to work to be treated like I belonged there commenting on the food. The lack of a sommelier is a noticeable miss also since there is an extensive wine list but nothing but up sellers pushing the most expensive options without real pairing consideration.  We found a pretty nice South African wine called Excelsior which was a less expensive cabernet sauvignon which matured in  stages.  It really went well with the all the fish with initial fruity tones of fig and a peppered wood. Sophisticated if you wait a good 30 minutes.

I got the combo trio plus one that is not on the menu but available... butterfish to die for, seared ahi ahi, teriyaki salmon, and a lovely grilled fish ( cannot remember which it was but it sat royally atop a lovely prepared potato slice).  Impeccable sauces and vegetable pairings were just the right thing to set this place apart from other fish houses.  

I could not help but also try a guiness chocolate cake special.  If it sticks around, definitely try it if you want to skip the souffle.  But who skips souffle unless they've had it every day for a month?! 

I have to acknowledge my servers, Ben and Erin.  They really worked hard to try to answer questions and were attentive to my needs.  My only note for improvement has to do with setting the tone initially.  There was something lacking a bit to make the experience warm from the start.  Perhaps it seemed too rehearsed and not genuine.  It was all redeemed after it seems Erin relaxed and was herself and got to really participating in our dining experience versus just serving us.  Does that make sense? In other words, by the time we were leaving I felt like she really did care that I had a good experience.  Still, it was good and I will return."}

With the discount I felt I could try a bit more and started my meal with an appetizer. I had the Ahi Poke, similar to a caviche small cubes of ahi came in a martini glass seasoned with some soy and garnished with a wasabi mayo. It was good but quite small. 

For my meal I selected the "Roy's classic trio" consisting of Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi & Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish. It came out with 3 small I mean small plates in a tasting style display. The Ahi was great, the spices went well with the cool raw interior. The Butter fish was nice too with a sweet miso glaze on a bed (or pillow in this case) of black rice. I thought the salmon was a bit over cooked. After I had finished the three 2oz tastings I was still hungry. 

I am probably not the only one with this opinion as on both weekday visits we were one of two tables.
 
I think if they want to increase the plate count they should lower the prices and or up the portion size."}

My husband and I visited for our anniversary and enjoyed the experience overall. 

Our waitress was so nice and very informative about the menu. My husband and I normally don't drink when we go out to eat but he decided to go ahead and order a beer. He asked for a "Dos Equis" and they let him know that they didn't carry that brand. He decided to go for his other favorite beer, Blue Moon, which they did carry. Sadly, the beer never came. Our waitress must have forgotten. The group that she was serving next to us was ordering so many drinks and so many menu items so she might have felt the tip over there was going to be higher and proceed to neglect us a little bit. Not a big deal. 

The food was really good and we, of course, ordered the chocolate souffle. Unfortunately, when I cut into the souffle, the chocolate didn't ooze out like it normally does. It was certainly over-baked. Again, not a huge deal as I've had it in the past and it's always been incredible. I'm sure it was just a fluke. 

Could our service and experience been better? I think so. Will be go back? Certainly!"}

The native New Yorker/bagel/pastry lover in me is always satisfied when I come here. Today's experience was nothing less than great. My bf and I came in around 5:30 PM and sat at the bar which is always open seating. We weren't too hungry but needed to have dinner and because our resolution is to make "healthier" choices when eating out, so we went with the crispy chicken salad (has a more specific name but I can't remember). I told our server we were sharing and when it came out, it was surprisingly split in 2 generous dishes. This made me wonder how huge the salad is unsplit because our respective dish filled us both! And the salad was deliciously made with fresh greens, tomatoes, corn, cheddar cheese topped with breaded chicken and their famous onion strings (my favorite part of it!). It comes with chipotle ranch and we were accidentally served with regular ranch on the side so I asked for the chipotle ranch which has a much tastier flavor in my opinion. I do love everything and anything chipotle. Our server was nice and attentive. After our quick dinner, I looked through the pastries to buy some whole wheat bread to take home. I also picked up the black and white cookie for dessert to-go. It is sweet goodness! A huge sugar cake cookie with half chocolate and half vanilla (I think) icing. The cookie itself to me has a slight lemony flavor to it. Yum!! All good things, all good things."}

Glad they finally got a printed kids menu.

Kids pizza was extra greasy, came out 25 minutes before my entree salad. For almost $17 I was hard pressed to find any chicken or bacon in my chopped Cobb salad. Zero blue cheese. I would have told the server but he disappeared until it was time to flag him down for our bill, which took him two passes by our table to drop off. Thank goodness I had correct change so I didn't have to endure another 1/2 assed apology/long wait.

Had high hopes.  Family of 3 ordered the chefs tasting menu.  Watermelon salad consisted of 5 bite size chunks of melon with a fresh cheese spread & dot of vinegar to touch melon in with a few sprouts atop.  It could have been much better.  The plates sat near the heat lamp too long and were quite warm along with the melon.  I was expecting cold crisp melon.  I really don't like to complain. 
  The 3 of us ordered flank steak atop sesame spinach with mushrooms.  The other orders of same dish looked appealing.  My entree was quite charred and when I took a bite I realized they covered it with soy sauce to try to soften the charred beef up.  The spinach was also covered in soy sauce.  The two other same entrees were not swimming in soy sauce.  I couldn't eat that.  I did bring it to managers attention.  What kind of chef would let that strap of leather flank steak leave their kitchen?
  Molasses tart with vanilla ice cream was good.  Extremely sweet center.  So sweet I couldn't eat all of it.
Been there tried it won't go back."}

We have dined here multiple times, one being last night (6/30/2016) about 90 minutes before closing. My husband ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano and was served the Chicken Carbonara. He received the correct dish after I finished eating. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles, which were over-fried. The mashed potatoes were reheated so badly that they were glued to the plate. At that point, I didn't even have the energy to complain about my meal since we already had to send my husband's order back since it was incorrect.

It is the second time I have been to this location.  We were seated right away and went ahead and ordered right after we received our drinks.

We waited for a very long time for our lunch to come.  I ordered a chef salad with the fat free honey mustard dressing.  When I looked in my dressing, there was this lump of something in it.  I poured it onto my bowl and it looked like a long rubbery lugie (sp?) or snotty thing.  I was immediately grossed out and was trying to find our waitress to help me out.  We hadn't seen our waitress in a very long time - we even had to call her over a couple of times for refills.  Well, she never came so then we saw the hostess coming by, so we grabbed her and showed her what was on my plate.  She made this horrible face and said she would take it away.  The manager came over after that and said he would expedite another one and tried to explain that the dressings come in a large gallon bucket and so that was rubbery ball was in the gallon of dressing (I actually own a restaurant that serves salads and have never come across something like that in 18 years).  

Well, after 15 minutes I finally got another salad.  When we were all done eating, the waitress brought our check to us.  On the bottom of the check it said that there was a comp for a salad for $9.99.  I thought this was a great way to remedy the problem (again, owning a restaurant myself, I would have done the same thing).  HOWEVER, when looking over the entire bill - Chompies staff/manager went ahead and charged me for TWO salads, comping only ONE them!  This way, it looked like they were comping the salad, but they really got paid for it!  We only ordered ONE salad!!

We asked the manager who was standing by our booth, if he meant to charge us for two salads, taking only one of our bill.  He was a bit stunned!  What a sneaky way to do business.  We payed the bill in full and WILL NEVER RETURN!!!!!!"}

Who knew that applesauce & sour cream would be so good together as a topping, obviously someone did & they were right. If you've never had matzo ball chicken soup, I suggest you try it. Note: it's the best when you are feeling under the weather! Also tried Rugulach - don't even know how to pronounce that correctly, but it's very similar to Baklava, so if you like that you won't be disappointed & it comes in a variety of flavors.
I have to say I like this Chompies better than the one in Tempe for a number of reasons.... but mainly because it's so much closer to my house! Lol :)

Go somewhere else......save your money."}

Through out the week we had several different items off the menu, potatoe latke, the french toast, bagels, and even some items from the bakery, and never dissapointed.

My experience here was horrible starting off with the seating arrangements. I asked for an extra large booth because I came with a party of 3 which included My mother whom just had knee surgery so  I asked for extra space to accommodate her legs and knees, the person upfront told me it would be a 5-10 minute wait which I was okay with. When the time passed we were seated to a regular booth. I told the staff members I specifically asked for a extra large booth, she then takes us back front and we were advised it would be another 20 min wait I was okay with that except I was promised the extra large booth from the beginning and now the waiting time exceeded the promised time. So I asked to speak with a manger. Brett who is the manager at this location asked me what was wrong I told him that I was promised a extra large booth for my party of 3 from the very moment I made the reservations. Needless to say I asked him if he would accommodate me and my guest for having to wait an additional time frame, he yelled and embarrassed me. While I kept a professional tone I was not about to let Brett get the worst in me. I told him I'd email the general manager he replied with "I DON'T CARE." That was the last straw from me. I don't know how a manger in his position was able to be rude and speak at unprofessional tone. I won't be returning to this location! After all I spent $100 on my bill to be treated with such poor costumer service. The waitress was extremely nice I must add but for the manager I would say fire him. The Cheesecake Factory doesn't need people like him. Don't love your job? Find a new one buddy!"}

That being said...it wasn't a disaster...just didn't live up to my expectations from previous visits to other Roy's locations. 


For an appetizer we got the Szechuan Pork Ribs which is still a favorite of mine here and I swear I would eat a whole rack of that. No complaints there. For the entree I got Ahi tuna and my date got the butterfish from my recommendation as I remember that being really good. I understand quality food takes time...and maybe I was really hungry as I was at the gym prior to coming here but it felt like ages before we got our food....seriously like 30-40 minutes or so from when we ordered it...I feel that is pretty long. I think our server forgot to put our order in until like 15 minutes have gone by. 

By the time our food arrived I was full on bread but I can always make room for delicious!....problem was...they forgot the delicious in my Ahi...it was dry and bland...I was disappointed...I tried to like it...I even didn't send it back at first even though my date kept insisting....but after taking a bite of her butterfish I realized what i was missing...so I sent it back and got the butterfish....which was just as good as I remembered. 

For dessert as allways...the chocolate souffle which is always a favorite. 

All in all the reason I'm giving 3 stars is the speed of food delivery and the blandness of the Ahi. I will come again and will re-review when I go back...i just hope for a better visit next time. 

PS: Both my drink and my date's drink were delicious. I got the pineapple mojito and she got a melon margarita."}

We have been to the Factory a couple of times before.  We were greeted very promptly and cheerily.

We asked to sit on the patio, the restaurant was fairly full and only one other table outside.  The patio at The Cheesecake Factory is fantastic!  The tables are spaced nicely, nice water feature in the center, greenery encloses the patio and misters run down the center of the patio as well as the outer edge.  Not that they would be used for a while, but the patio is equipped with heaters for winter night patio dinning.

Hannah was our server.  She suggested several items and very patiently took care of two of us adults and the kids while we waited for two others in our party to arrive.  Hannah was very attentive and engaged our kids too!  This is always great from a server because our children are a big part of our experience and they comment to us on restaurants, services, hotels and entertainment.  Sometimes too much.  Our daughter loves the bread the Factory brings to your table and of course the Godiva Cheesecake!

Our other dining guests arrived, with more shopping bags then we left them with, and we proceeded to enjoy the palate creations from the menu. We decided to try multiple appetizers for a variety of flavors. We ordered the fried artichoke hearts, avocado eggrolls, Tex-Mex eggrolls, ahi tartare, shitake asparagus bacon pizzette and Thai lettuce wraps.  The kids enjoyed mini corndogs and bowtie pasta.  Our son loved the mini corndogs because they came skewered and he had sticks to stab his fries and anything and anyone at the table. 

The different flavors and textures were wonderful.  Our table have been/are in the food business and we enjoyed discussing the sauces, what we would change, how it would affect the items they came with and just plain enjoyed the entire meal.  We also enjoyed the drinks, particularly the sangria.  It was very fruity and extremely refreshing on the patio!  

We ordered cheesecake, the Godiva Chocolate, for our daughter of course, the Dutch Apple Streusel and the Caramel Pecan Turtle.  Hannah and several other staff members graciously accepted our request to surprise our daughter for her birthday.  They wrote in chocolate Happy Birthday and added several confectionery candy dots to her cheesecake lit a candle and sang Happy Birthday.  They were great!

Thanks Hannah and the staff at The Cheesecake Factory for helping us celebrate our daughters 8th birthday.  We will be back!"}

Both were fabulous. This has become our new favorite place to go for special dinners or anytime dinners for that matter.

We were attracted by the huge variety of food choices on the menu online. This location is across the street from the Chandler Fashion Mall. We were seated right away.

I had the soup and slider combo ($8.99). I chose the chicken noodle soup (average) and two Jewish sliders (excellent). The sliders were stuffed with tender beef brisket, cheese and a potato pancake on Challah bread rolls (also excellent). There were sides of a creamy cole slaw and brown gravy. I can't say the gravy added anything to the sandwich, so I ate one sandwich without the gravy and took the other sandwich home.

My friend had the corned beef Reuben mile high sandwich with cole slaw and fries ($14.99) and was only able to eat half of the meal and took the rest home. She loved the flavors, but found the mountain of meat daunting to eat. She ended up attacking it with knife and fork. 

When the server asked us if we would like some dessert we both looked at him like he was crazy since we both stuffed with just half the lunch. The dessert case was within eye shot and looked tempting, but alas no room left in the tummy for those temptations.

The theme of the food, decor, and menu seems to be New York City (I supposed because it hosts a plethora of Jewish delis). The seating is a little crowded, but the place seems clean. Service was good, but not very speedy (OK for this visit since we were not in a rush). Parking is plentiful and we found a spot close to the door. We would recommend this Chompie's deli and will likely return in the future."}

A nice perk of making reservations here online is that they offer 1000-point Opentable reservations for certain times and days.  This will put you half-way towards redeeming a gift certificate!  

After we got seated and were poring through the menu, we received a plate of steamed edamame to snack on.  They were nicely seasoned with a sweet-salty-spicy mixture.  They currently offer a prix-fixe menu, where you get your choice of 1 out of 3 appetizers, entrees, and 1 out of 2 desserts for about $36.  Our waiter recommended a few a-la-carte items for our meal, which is what I ended up ordering (Go with what the experts know!).  

I started with the lobster potstickers.  They had a nice crunchy pan-fried outer texture to contrast with the ginger-lobster filling.  The lobster was nice and tender, and had a delicate flavor that went pretty well with the sauce and glaze accompanying the dumplings.  My husband had ordered the prix-fixe menu, and decided on the citrus salad, which was served in a beautiful presentation, with bright, vibrant colors, and refreshing flavors.  

As for the entree, I got the recommended misoyaki butterfish.  The butterfish was indeed a tender, buttery melt-in-your mouth texture.  The glaze seemed more heavy on the "(teri)yaki" side rather than the "miso" side, and as a result it was a bit too sweet for me.  There was a small bed of a pico de gallo type mixture on top of the fish which helped balance out the sweetness of the glaze somewhat, but I would have needed more of it to go with the rest of the fish since it was a limited amount.  The presentation was beautiful, as the darkly glazed fish was perched on top of a bed of bok-choy and forbidden black rice, surrounded by an emerald green wasabi sauce.  I also tried some of the prix-fixe pork shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender, excellently seasoned with a lovely broth-like sauce.  

We shared dessert, which was the chocolate souffle.  The molten dark chocolate in the souffle was nice, and the cold vanilla ice cream was a good complement to the deep, rich chocolatey hot souffle.

Service was a little sluggish, but friendly.  If you feel like splurging on a good meal, Roy's might be a good choice if you want an upscale Hawaiian experience in Arizona."}

Menu is large with three pages of breakfast items alone. I however chose to have non-breakfast (cup of vegetarian split pea soup and a half lite albacore sandwich). It was nice that lunch was available that early. Portions are quite generous. My brother had the biggest pastrami/corned beef/brisket sandwich I've ever seen. I submitted a picture. He loved it. Our server was prompt and steady. 
What compelled me to write this review was the bakery/deli section on the other side of the restaurant. I submitted a picture too. Dessert selection was great and everything looked delicious. I asked about a decadent looking chocolate cake and the very nice man running the deli took out a slice and gave me a large piece to sample. Then he gave me another chocolate pastry he thought I may like. After that I didn't need dessert! But we bought a few pastries to take home including a very intricate minion cake. This gentleman was so friendly. I think that is a great way to get people's business. All the desserts we brought home were very good. If I lived here I would come back again and again for the desserts alone."}

Sadly, I saw a family leave without ordering cuz they waited so long for service. My server greeted me right away. 

My lunch arrived in seven mins. I guess pickles are a big thing cuz each party received a tray of dill spears. I never liked them so they went ignored. My bagel sandwich was served open faced on an 'everything' bagel. 

There was plenty of meat on the sandwich, along with melted cheese and a hint of mustard (more at the table). The flavors were all there but it was a very difficult sandwich to eat. Even open-faced with a knife and fork, it kept falling apart. I think the bagel was over grilled. I'll try a different dish next time."}

It seemed like the cooks didn't know how to use the spices correctly with the pastas because the Louisiana chicken pasta that I ordered didn't have much flavor to it, but the chicken was good. 3 star pasta

The burger was undercooked. My friend said he would take the Whataburger burger over the burger he ordered at the Cheesecake Factory. 2 star burger 

The only thing that tasted for what we paid for was the filet mignon. 4 star filet 

We also had eggplants which were really good and they came with a side dish of pasta with pesto which was completely tasteless. Probably the worst pasta I have ever tried anywhere. It was almost like eating pasta with water. The manager came over replacing the pasta with a pasta Alfredo which was excellent. 3 star eggplant

Our server was very young and very tall, he said he turned 21 just 2 weeks ago. He started off really bad and didn't even smile. Later on it got better. We gave him a hard time ordering which he handled pretty good but kept forgetting somethings and misunderstood some other things. 3 star service.

So it's a little bit but it miss with how good your food was. Except for the burger. 

I would say let the Cheesecake Factory keep on making cheese cakes and not full restaurant menus. For me the first and last time eating out here. 

Also one thing that raised my concern was that my friend saw one of the cooks spit to his side. We couldn't see if he spit on the food or on the floor or he just had a gum in his mouth. Ether way, I don't believe you should ever spit anywhere when you handle the food."}

This place is always busy and I've never been able to understand why. If no one ever gave me a gift card here, I would never eat here.

The service varies from very good to awful, but the food always never exceeds "well, it didn't make me sick."

Today's meal failed even that low standard. As an appetizer I ordered some mini-corn dogs. I *love* corn dogs. At the fair, from Weinerschnitzel, from frozen at home, and so on.

These little balls of corn meal enriched pancake batter were deep fried to near burnt and yet managed to soak up enough grease to squeeze out nice puddle of oil. I only ate one, but within five minutes I was nauseas. 

The California omelet was not much better. Sour cream shouldn't curdle, right? The veggies and cheese were barely cooked.
It was more like a salad wrap, where the wrap happened to be egg.
If I had wanted a salad with egg, I'd have ordered a Cobb, not an omelet.

The banana cheese cake was good according to the spousal unit & I enjoyed my strawberry lemonade.

Still have $10 left on the gift card. I think that'll get me a couple of lemonades."}

The special dietary request on the tortilla salad... no... avocado sauce on salad... well it was on salad. Add chicken.... waited for chicken to come as it was forgotten. 
The manager did come by about the chicken but did not address the stuff in my tartar sauce that grossed everyone out that we packed up to leave. 
This company does not have child friendly cups. What we got was a flimsy plastic cup with a lid and a straw that was so soft it implodes in the hands of a two year old. No coloring placemats, no crayons. At least that's what our waiter said. There were so many kids in the restaurant you wonder why they don't make any effort to make it kid friendly. We ordered the child's chicken grilled. It had so much pepper on it and spicy she threw it up. Spicy grilled chicken for a toddler?  Luckily we tasted it but it was too late. Oh the Manager?

My most recent experience at the Chandler location hit rock bottom.  I was here with two friends and everything just seemed to go wrong.  No joke, at some point during the meal all three of us had to send our meals back to the kitchen (something that none of us had ever done before).  One friend received her meal about ten minutes before the rest of us (she didn't want to be the only person eating so her meal got cold).  When my other friend got her tacos, they included an ingredient that she specifically asked to be omitted for allergy reasons.  The highlight of the evening was what I found in my chicken Madeira .  What I thought was a burnt mushroom, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a piece of CARDBOARD!  Bizarre, right?!?  On a positive note, the food itself (when we finally got it ~14 minutes later) was tasty and the waitstaff was very apologetic.  For our troubles, we were comped the dinner, but I'm not sure that'll be enough to make me revist the Cheesecake Factory any time soon."}

We were half an hour early for our reservations, but they took it in stride. This may be the best service I've ever received from a restaurant staff. They were very into the "special occasion" and went WAY out of the way to make it special for us. They had their hands full, as the restaurant was busy, and I know there were at least 2 birthdays within earshot (no they don't sing to you). The food was FANTASTIC. We started with a spicy shrimp roll, it was VERY GOOD. My wife had the surf & turf (steak & lobster), she gave me a bite of both, and the steak may have been one of the tastiest steaks I've ever had. The lobster was also great, not overcooked, good flavor. I had ribs, done more like roast beef, it was also very good, a little "fatty", though that can be expected with ribs. I was also served something I'd never had before. It was like a hard boiled egg (yolk still runny - similar to over medium-like) then peeled, and fried like chicken... I had thought it was a hush-puppy or something similar, so I was surprised, but it was great! They gave us a free dessert, and a $20 gift card. We left with a great experience, bellies full & a framed picture of us that they took while we ate dessert. We will be recommending this place to our friends. Thank you for your wonderful service. I rated the food a 4/5 star, and that is probably harsh. The ribs were fatty, but still very good overall. I also rated the ambiance a 4/5 which I feel is fair. The tables are pretty close together, and the restaurant overall got pretty loud. It was a romantic ambiance, just loud. Everything else was worthy of 5 stars in my opinion."}

I loved this place when I was like 8 years old and they were only located in california. Now, it is just a strange experience. It's strange because people line up to come here and wait an hour sometimes.... for what? The food is mediocre at best and it's incredibly overpriced. Anyway, my brother had given me a gift card to this restaurant for chrisanuka. So I finally got around to using it last night. I was in class until 8 and needed to go someplace that was open late (and since we had the gift card, this was the place). The first thing I really hate about this restaurant is the menu size. It is totally unnecessary and every time I go here I just sit and stare at the menu for ever before figuring out what I want. And it's not because it is all too good, It is trying to figure what type of food do I want, what isn't going to be incredibly ridiculously unhealthy, and what isn't 15$ because that is just too much to be spending on a mediocre meal in a chain restaurant. I could go to a pretty good local restaurant and pay the same. Also, with such a big menu I wonder how much of it could possibly be fresh... everything on their menu can't be ordered everyday...? I don't know. So last night I finally decided on the Saigon chicken sandwich with a side salad and the BF got the club. Both were fine, at least with the sandwiches the portion size isn't quite so crazy. 

Kind of on a side note, our waitress last night was really strange. I think she was putting on an accent and she kept including herself in her questions ie Would we like some pepper on our salad? (um I don't know, would you, creepy waitress lady?) Also, I don't know if the restaurant changed, or what, but she spouted off a 5 minute speech when we got there about the menu (and on page 5 you will find this item, and on page 7, this item).... that was really strange. I have the menu right in front of me.... it is large, so maybe I need direction around it, but generally I can read.

So anyway, for two sandwiches, no drinks, we paid 27$. That is insane. But we had the gift card, so it turned out alright.... but seriously... why do people eat here? I do not understand it! What is the appeal!!!?!?!?!?!


Ok sorry for the rant."}

The service is impersonal. The food is sub-par, from limp bacon to undercooked eggs. I also don't understand the $7.50 price tag for a single Belgian waffle. It wasn't particularly big or tasty. 

I'll still keep coming for the sliders and the bakery, but I hope this location someday can match the quality of the Tempe Chompies."}

As an avid Roy's lover it is exciting I can now enjoy one of my favorite restaurants for lunch. Not many people must know that they are open because when we went a couple weeks ago it was only us and one other party. But not a problem for us as it granted us excellent service! We started with the lobster potstickers (a must in my book) and the lobster bisque (not pictured) which were both amazing. The lunch potions come on cute little plates served with soup, and side salad, and white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. I got the Shrimp and Pineapple Fried Rice which was enjoyable, but I've definitely had better entrees from this establishment. Great dining experience, will definitely be back!"}

Bottom line is I thought it was OK.  Nothing special and not bad; just OK.  Pricey for a two course meal @ $36 per head.  Drinks were not on special and they charged $9 for a well bloody mary and $9 for a mimosa as well -- high priced IMO for the ocassion.  Some of the dishes were well done and flavorful; some mediocre at best.  Fruit poke starter (fruit cocktail) was uninspiring and very, very small.  However their starter of chopped chicken salad with blue cheese and lemon grass vinaigrette was of a nice size and very good.  I had the ramen starter and that was good and of a nice size too.  Entrees of chicken karaage were also of a nice size, however, it was not chicken karaage but chicken katsu -- get it right if you are supposed to be an Asian fusion restaurant!  I had the rib steak with an egg on top with kim chee.  Nice 8 oz piece of meat cooked rare, the way I like it.  That was good and worthy of the price.  Kim chee was over fermented, but OK.  However, the so-called short rib hash was a real disappointment.  3/8 inch cubes of potatoes plain fried with small pieces of meat that didn't really look like, or taste like, short rib meat.  SIL had macadamia nut pancakes -- three small (about 5 inch) pancakes with mac nuts and powdered sugar on them.  Certainly NOT worthy of the $36 price accompanied by about an ice cream scoop of the fruit cocktail starter.  Each table was supposed to get a $20 gift card as a kickback.  Our server knew nothing of this and had to go ask the manager.  Only then did we get our $20 gift card.  Bad strategy if they are hoping people forgot to ask for the gift card or don't know anything about it.  All-in-all, it was OK but next time I will look for a more interesting and worthy dining experience for a special day or occasion."}

I had their special which was four smaller servings of their butterfish, mahi mahi, salmon and seared ahi tuna.  I enjoyed this a lot, but the ahi tuna did not have a lot of flavor and others at the table who had the same thing agreed.  I also had a mango mojito that was perfect!  I did try a couple of bites of one of their signature deserts... it was a flourless chocolate cake with a creamy chocolate center and a hint of raspberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream it was soooo good!

My most recent visit (last week) was pretty typical. FABULOUS service from a Lady who knew exactly how to successfully wait on a small party. As usual, her impeccable service made the experience all the more enjoyable.

I always have a difficult time NOT having The Butter Fish dish. It had been voted as one of the Top Ten Dishes in Las Vegas when I lived there a couple of years ago and, although I have never eaten Butterfish anywhere else - OUT OF THIS WORLD!

On this particular visit, our party had a couple of Appetizers (Pot Stickers, Sea Scallops) and two salads (Chopped, Maui Wowie Shrimp) as well as the aforementioned Butterfish entrée our other entrees included, Salmon and both of the available Mahi Mahi dishes.

EVERYTHING was prepared superbly and I can honestly say, that outside of Legal's (East Coast) Roy's does fish better than any other Chain, and better than most Independents specializing in fish.

A great treat every visit and this past one was as good if not better thanany!

He cared that our food came out correct the first time, loved my grand kids and treated them as his own, to which they still ask about him.  We have not gone back since that Saturday over a year ago when I asked to sit with Dave and the girl said he wasn't in today? I was perplexed, as this was a Saturday and busy and he was always there, to which I stated what day was he coming in, and was told not anymore, they let him go!  I was genuinely saddened, as was my entire family to find out that he was no longer a server there, as was many other long timers who were also gone?  Dave was the best waiter, and made all of us, even my picky Jewish mom from Boca... feel at home like in a Brooklyn diner! Chompies food is sub-par but we only went there for Dave, so for them to let go of the best waiter they had, that brought so many customers who enjoyed him, and put up with the food, is beyond me! Also, Dave was such a good waiter that he even made you feel like you had a friend to eat with, when at times I would eat breakfast alone after a good hike.. I miss those days with Dave."}

Well I decided to try Chompies for breakfast today and I got portobellas again so I must be a gluten for punishment.  I was actually seated in the front today which was cool and my waitress was very nice, but the eggs benedict was not what I was expecting.  The Portobello Benedict is more expensive than all but the one with lox which was kinda sad since I am vegetarian.  They have departed from the standard eggs benedict with not a appealing result.  It comes on a bagel that is supposed to be toasted which is wasn't. So it was cold and chewy and a whole lot of bread in comparison to the rest of the toppings. They also decided to add cheese to all of the different combos which when you combine it with the hollandaise is not a good thing.  And there were only two tiny pieces of mushroom on the whole plate.... so I am not sure what I was charged extra for. Very disappointing there are far better eggs benny in the area ( see my other reviews )  Maybe this place is just not for vegetarians.  If you do go and order the eggs benedict do yourself a favor and get the english muffin ( tell them to toast it ) and skip the cheese.

For Lunch:

When I ate here with some friends in the middle of the afternoon we were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant.  We kind of laughed it off wondering why we were shuttled away to the dark lonely bowels of the restaurant.   I can only guess they have a weird seating chart or the waitress was being punished for some reason.  They were pretty dead so you would think they would want to keep the travel distance to a minimum.  Another group was seated about 10 minutes later across the room from us and they actually had the server move them.

The food was just average at best.  Nothing really stood out on the menu when we were ordering. I got a pretty tasteless Portabella/Goat Cheese salad.  The service we pretty slow, but it might have just been due to the 30 minute hike to our table.  Maybe I'll have to come back by for breakfast."}

Recently, though, they cut down their portions. The sandwich used to be huge, so huge that I only got a half sandwich (and I can put away half a pizza and a dozen wings).  Now, it's small, And they serve the fries in this little, white fruit cup. Weird, and small. This the only reason I didn't do a 4th star.

The bakery is good, too. They have tons of good stuff there."}

Alone on a Friday night. *sigh*
Tonight I walked in at 8:59 pm (they close at 9:00pm. Yes, I'm that guy) and they still sat me. I ordered some soup and shortly after could hear some people in the kitchen hustling to make it for me because they had already started cleaning things up. I could tell they were shutting down and I felt a little bad.

Then my waitress, named Kara, was the bomb. She was extremely friendly. She didn't rush me at all. She even said, "Don't rush, we still have work to do." Her genuine cheerfulness made me feel better about coming in so late. She also offered me water as I left.

I gave her a good tip, but after I left I realize I added it up incorrectly. I checked the transaction online just now and they didn't put my tip on it at all. Maybe this is because she felt bad that I initially felt a bit rushed? Or maybe this is a policy that if the customer (me) adds it up incorrectly they just take it off completely? I'm going with the former.

The food is always good and my soup was very yummy, as was my cake.

Kara rocks. She made my evening."}

However, since we stayed at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass, we tried the Roy's in Chandler. As far as ambiance, the Desert Ridge location is better since it is located in a resort and their patio seating makes you feel like you are in Hawaii (think palm trees and tiki torches) The Roy's in Chandler location is located in a mall area. The food and the service at the Chandler location were excellent. I got my usual which is the Ahi and hot chocolate souffle. Everything was delicious. We were celebrating some birthdays and the staff made us feel special with birthday desserts and a group picture. Would definitely return if we are in the area again. Rating 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the mall location. We have dined at many other Roy's restaurants all over the country. Many other Roy's locations have great views, this one does not."}

I have had all the sliders and Original are the best. That said, you can't go wrong with any of their breakfast choices, but the stuffed french toast is more like a dessert than anything.

Avocado Salad,  Fresh and delicious.  Not overdressed. 
Chicken Piccata with pasta and plenty of Parmagiano Reggiano, grated right in front of you.  
Delicious and perfectly made.
Eggplant Parmagiana with Pesto Pasta,  Really delicious.  Sauce was great.  Pesto pasta was not overly aggressive with garlic.  It was just right.  
Kobe Burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms and sweet potato fries. Had this because there were no turkey burgers.  The Kobe Burger was OK but nothing to write home about.  Sweet potato fries were good.  
The bread was delicious but we had to ask about 3 times before we got our first service of bread although the place was not packed.  Tasty bread.  Other than that, the service was good as they kept our waters refreshed.  
I will admit that I was shocked by how good their pasta dish was.  I normally don't even try italian dishes at non-italian restaurants but the waiter, Jesus, convinced me it was a wonderful dish.  
It was refreshing to go to a Cheesecake Factory and have a meal that I don't have to complain about.  I just want good food and good service and I got it at this Cheesecake Factory."}

After 20 minutes a waitress finally stopped by to tell us that she was off and she would see why no one wanted to serve us. After another 10 minutes we got up and left. 
On the way out the door I stopped back at the hostess and asked why there were 10+ people working and yet no one cared about helping us. She replied "uh, (pause) sorry. Where were you seated?"  I was seated right where you sat me!

My wife and I dined at the original location in Oahu when we got married; that's how much we enjoy Roy's. We plan to go back for our anniversary dinner each year.

Each location has a slightly different menu so when I was in Phoenix for a business trip I wanted to make sure to get the chef's specials for this location. I had the lobster sushi roll and lobster pot stickers for appetizers, and the Himalayan Sea Salt Ribeye with a side of scallops for the entree. Although I love Roy's I have to say the steak wasn't that great. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the cut of meat had too much connective tissue I had to work around. The scallops were wonderful, soft and tender and very flavorful.

It's chicken with bacon, mushrooms, onions, garlic in a thick white wine Riesling sauce served with buttered Parmesan pasta! The BOMB!#A new fav!

We just finished our meal at Chompie's and I felt I had to write my review while the memory was still fresh, unlike the food. It was my worst meal in a long, long time. 

Our server asked if we were ready to order as soon as we sat down, which is odd considering the menu is 6 pages long. Tip one: don't eat at a restaurant that has a big menu because it means they don't do anything well. 

I ordered the Biltmore Benedict with a potato latke side. The Benedict was SALTY. It was salt-lick salty. I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. The latke was a tasteless potato puck, only harder. 

I guess it's partly my fault because if I had wanted an "authentic New York Deli," I should have gone to New York. My bad.

If you're a patio person, come during the evening. The whole ambiance just seems to be romantic, that is if you're out on a date. 

As soon as we sat down, our waitress came and introduced herself. It was a little difficult to hear her with all the Music and people there so maybe they should alert their staff members to speak up. 

Our order was quickly taken along. If you don't know what type of food you want, come here. They have so many food choices to pick from for instance, Mexican, Italian, American etc. I went ahead with angel hair pasta with shrimp which in fact satisfied my appetite. 

After dinner, you're going to be asked if you want dessert. I didn't know what kind of cheese cake to try so I asked our server what new comers normally try and are pleased with. She suggested I try the red velvet cheesecake so I went ahead and ordered that. It was probably one of the best cheesecakes I've had in a while. A little on the sweet side but I scraped majority of the frosting off. 

Looking forward to coming back to another Cheesecake Factory, I might even come back to this specific location. 

Great environment, friendly staff, and tasteful food. 

(I'm giving four stars because our server was really nice until we left. It felt as if she was being nice to us up until we signed for the bill.

I was contacted by someone at Chompies who's important enough to man their yelp account, and told that my name was on a "list" and they'd "make it right" on my next visit. So,  here we are 3 months later and my daughter wanted a bagel - so against my better judgment,  we thought we'd give Chompies a chance to do what they previously promised to do, and make it right.
Keep in mind we arrived at about 1:30 in the afternoon and the place was half-full at best. Low and behold though, we had a case of some serious dejavu! After 10 minutes of many waiters walking by but not stopping or saying a word to us -  I thought I'd go over to the bar area where they had a host, a waiter, and some girl with a name tag on but was sitting on an actual barstool, all having a great time. I told the host that we'd been there for 10 minutes and Yada Yada yada..and asked if there was a waiter that could assist. He said he get one for us, and another 5 minutes go by, still no service to speak of so we left.. again!! I was able to speak to a manager on the way out and voice my concern and she said she even remembered this happening to us the last time we were there. It boggles my mind how naturally it comes to practically everyone working there, that their customers don't matter. Well played Chompies,  well played."}

I have read a lot of the other reviews on this site and I wonder if they ate at the same restaurant I did?  In my opinion an "authentic" deli does not sell Boars head meats in their deli.  They make their own meats, smoke their own etc.  They don't buy it from a wholeseller out of the back of the truck behind the store.  Strike one.  Ordered the Pastrami and was beaming from ear to ear when it arrived as I have been looking for a huge stacked Pastrami since I moved to Arizona in 1980.  Unfortunately the Pastrami had absolutely no taste.  So disappointed.  Strike 2.  I then asked for some spicy mustard (hoping it would help with the taste) and was told they don't have that kind of mustard.  Strike 3 we're outta here.  I will give them a point for being as close to a real deli as I have found in Phoenix, but I will definately continue to look and I will definately not be back to Chompies."}

Its crowded, more so on the weekends,  but have you ever been to a deli in New York? They always seem to be packed, sometimes with lines out the door. The crowd doesnt bother me. 

The only thing that really irks me here is we have regularly had bad/slow service. Like a drink never refilled or a side of something we didn't get that we served just before the bill after reminding them. So I am a little more agressive about flagging down my service here. 

Again, I love it, its comfort and home food that I don't have to cook. I don't have friends who cook Jewish food, so this is my only shot in AZ unless I'm making it myself."}

Begin with the Miso soup, you will not be disappointed. The Lobster was broiled to perfection and the Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked tasting better than any steak I've had in the Phoenix metro area in recent memory. We were at Morten's last month and this blew them away. Last trip to Morten's for us. The service could have been a slight bit better although she was swamped and held her own with the help of the ancillary staff.  Our server was very friendly and kudos to her for the recommendation of pineapple upside down cake with toasted coconut ice cream. This was one of the best desserts I've EVER had and I love dessert. Our party of 4, 1 of which is quite a cook herself, was indeed impressed.

Our other waiter, Corey, did a phenomenal job of helping us with our dessert options (he made a plan with my husband to surprise me! How cute!!!!).

The only problem I have with Chompie's is that the menu is so big, it's always mind boggling to figure out what you want to eat. The portions are big, their cream cheeses are all delish ( I particularly love the lox and the chive).
Their potato latkas are hard to pass up. They are a jewish style potato pancake.  Their mile high sandwiches are HUGE. The meat is just piled up and fresh and you really can;t go wrong. I've also enjoyed their GIGANTIC salads ( with a leftover serving or 2 for home), The Cobb salad is definitely my favorite. It's enough for 2-3 meals and costs about $11.

I gotta say eating low carb, this is one of the best restaurants that is reasonable priced with several options. Sure, it's hard to ignore the delicious smells of fresh bagels wafting around, and the awesome dessert display when you walk in, but if you can make it past that, you will have hot coffee refilled promptly, or order a nice bloody mary and enjoy some simple, large portions of food.

Now the bad:

-Seated at a dirty table
-Tea tasted like sewer water
-Eggs were cooked the wrong style (not what I ordered), and one was so undercooked that the eggwhite ran with the yolk. Not a good sign, didn't eat it.
-Hollandaise was not lemony, rich, or buttery. It was worse than the stuff you make at home out of a packet. It basically tasted like someone made a roux and dyed it yellow.
-General lack of interest in service 

I did report the egg issue as politely as I could to my server, who empathetically said "Awww," and then walked away. 

If you review the glass-enclosed pastry area, you may be surprised to discover that literally everything in the case has been mislabeled- the fun game is trying to figure out what is what! (seriously, that's what we did while waiting for our dirty table.)

I had the lobster bisque which had an amazing flavor but it upset my stomach and I was unable to enjoy the rest of my meal. I ordered the lobster omelet as my entree and was very underwhelmed. Not worth the high price tag. There was very little flavor and very little seafood in the omelet and a lot of onion, which I am not a huge fan of. Those in our party that ordered the steaks and short ribs were very pleased with their meals. The service was good, they changed out our silverware between each course, which we ended up laughing about by the end of the meal. I've never used so many different forks and spoons and knives in one sitting. The lighting was incredibly dim for a mid-day meal. I would understand if it was dinner time and they were trying for an intimate atmosphere, but it was 12 in the afternoon.

I've been here a few times before when travelling in the Phoenix Area.

It is good, honest deli food.  It's not quite like a real East-Coast deli, but close enough that most folks won't know the difference.  The menu is about a mile long, as is traditional for a deli.  The food was pretty good.  Our server was a little new, and I think a little confused.  But that's more a training issue than a service issue.  They did a nice job and I was satisfied.  I'd been going through "pastrami withdrawl" - had the mile-high.  It was good.  I also had the split pea soup and got to try the mushroom barley.  Both are also good and I'd recommend them highly."}

We sat in the bar area. Pretty noisy but we are not to particular about that. Partly because we enjoyed the food so much that day. My boyfriend and I shared an appetizer and a 3 course meal. We started out w the lobster bisque. SO delicious! Creamy and the lobster tasted fresh. For the course we had a calamari salad. It was not greasy and had a ton of flavor. They didn't have a sauce probably because it wasn't necessary! For the main course we had the shredded pork and rice. I'm having it as leftovers 2 days later for lunch and it's still soOo good. So tender and it melts in your mouth. The rice was soft and fluffy and it came w a boiled egg that was fried or something. Just amazing. I'm not a big dessert person but we had the chocolate soufflé w ice cream. Pretty good and I'm assuming it was because my BF finished the whole plate. I will be back any times more if the food is consistent. Oh.. Almost forgot.. Tried their Mai Tai.. Again I'm not a fan of sweets and their Mai Tai was too sweet for my taste. The server said it was made all at once and offered to make me another one to my liking. He took it off my bill and was very nice about taking it back. Love this place!"}

When you go to a bagel place you expect a good bagel and it surprised me that they even survived it to him.  Well mistakes happen and that is not the reason for the 1 star.  the reason for 1 star was the response I received.  It was near closing time when the food arrived and they said that all of the bagels had been put away so they could not replace it.  The waitress offered a discount of $2 off the bagel part of my son's mean (his meal was $12 total).  He did eat the rest, but that is because he was Hungary and the rest of us were started eating.  It was not about the money, but I was not happy with them serving him a burnt bagel, being unwilling to get a new bagel for him in the back and only offering $2 off so I asked for the manager.  The manager said she would comp the meal, but when the bill came it was only the $2 off.  I paid the bill and give a less than normal tip, but its really disappointing that they would not either (a) give him the bagel that he wanted (meaning getting the put away bagels out for him), or (b) comp the whole meal.  This really took away from what was a nice evening with the family.  The food was actually pretty good, but with service like this we will not be back."}

Good service and great price for the specialty beer (Kona Brewing Co. Fire Rock Pale Ale) which happens to be my favorite.  This beer is only priced at $3 during Happy Hour and a few select drinks at $7.  My GF decided to have Kahlua and Cream and that was $10 -- a little steep IMO.  Their Happy Hour menu is $7 per small dish; but with only 4 or 5 things on the menu you don't have much of a choice.  We had the Wagyu burger ($10), the ahi roll, and the crispy pork in steamed bun -- they were all good.  We ran up a bill of $60 and were going to leave and use our $20 gift card and were told that the gift card cannot be used for Happy Hour......WTF?  They never said that when we got the gift card as a kickback for spending more than $200 at Mother's Day!  So we had to buy an entree at $32 to use the gilft card.  So the net is that we spent $72 for Happy Hour.  Bottom line is Roy's is OK, but nothing special and their prices are high.  Make your own Happy Hour at some small bistro or some quaint Italian restaurant and it will probably be better and cheaper!"}

If you have a sweet tooth, I recommend ordering the Stuffed French Toast. It's delicious and huge! They take their Challah bread and fill it with whipped cream cheese and strawberry jam and deep fry it. Then, they top it off with jam and whipped cream. This order comes with fruit and they will allow you to substitute some ingredients. Example, I have swapped the whipped cream cheese with peanut butter. That makes it stuffed peanut butter and jelly stuffed French toast. It is awesome! I love their sliders and the corn beef has skillet with eggs sunny side up. Best brownie in my opinion is the black and white brownie. So many great options!"}

This is the first time we have dined in the main restaurant. I had made Sunday dinner reservations for a party of 3 at 7:00 p.m. I was pleased to see how busy it was on an off night. Eric was our server took very good care of us.

We started off with cocktails, the 1988 and Pacific Cooler while we perused the menu. For appetizers we ordered the Crispy Togarashi Calamari, Ahi Tuna Poke, and Lobster Bisque. Entrees were: Classic Four (Hibachi Grilled Atlantic Salmon - Misoyaki "Butterfish" Blackened Island Ahi - Roasted Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi) and the Pistachio Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb.

Just to note: My friend was settled on the Hibachi Grilled Atlantic Salmon, but was told after we ordered that there was no Salmon that day, that included the Salmon on our Classic 4. I would like to suggest to the restaurant mangers, that maybe when the customer is seated and handed a menu, up front your service staff should say "we apologize that we do not have salmon on the menu tonight." In stead of customers having to go back re-look at the menu especially when you specialize in seafood.

Other than that the drinks were delish. The appetizers were good. The Lobster Bisque was excellent. The main entrees were very good. I shared the Classic 4 with my friend and it was perfect. Nice to get a tasting of all the seafood. 

Atmosphere: nice, Service: very good, Food: very good"}

Last night we dined at Roy's. Our server, Bruce, was quite slow and forgetful. 3 other couples that come in at the same time ate and left before we even got our entrees. To start we ordered drinks, which were quite slow to arrive. Our menus were already closed but we were not asked if ready to order. Instead Bruce explained the chef's special then rushed off. He returned some time later but walked right by us without a word and proceeded to take the order of the table next to us, who were seated after us. Finally he returned, explained the chef's special once again and then took our order. I ordered my meal and a glass of wine and requested it come with my dinner. Bruce explained that Edamame was served by request only now and we said yes we want some. He also mentioned the usual desserts that take extra time and we let him know we would on fact want the chocolate lava cake. My husbands sushi came out first, but no Edamame. Finally I asked and Bruce said 'oh, you want Edamame now?' as if we hadn't already requested it. He then set out plates. 20 minutes later a busser came to clear those plates, yet we had not received the Edamame. He quickly had this error corrected.  I had my usual favorite, short ribs. But the wine did not come until I was almost finished. The short ribs were dry and lacked the usual flavor. My husband's dessert arrived a while later, but Bruce never asked if I wanted dessert. Finally, to end the evening we had to flag Bruce down for the check. He lacked the attention and service we usually get at Roy's. And with the less than par food, this experience left a lot to be desired."}

The restaurant is beautiful and you are greeted by a huge fish tank with exotic fish near the hostess stand.  Feels like a little bit of Hawaii!

I did not know this place would be so "intimate" as in dimmed overhead lighting with candles on each table.  It would make a great place for a special date night.

As for the food, I tried the tempura ahi tuna roll appetizer, the short ribs entree, and the lemon blueberry cheesecake.  My favorite was definitely dessert!  The cheesecake was thick and creamy with a sweet graham cracker crust and topped with lots of whipped cream and TONS of blueberries.  The ahi roll was good, although I would have liked it even better if it had not been fried and had just been a regular roll.  The short ribs were also good and very tender, but sooo rich and fatty.  I know that's what you should expect with short ribs, but it was almost to the point of being TOO rich.  And the flavoring/marinade on it was a bit strong and salty.  I think it would be good with a lot of bland potatoes or something to balance it out.  It did come with a mashed potatoes side, but not enough to counter all the strong flavor and fats from the short ribs.

I also like that they offer online reservations, makes it so simple and easy to plan your night out."}

My son had the hibachi steak which was very good. And my daughter had chicken alfedo. Then the waitress made an unforgivable error. After she took my daughters left over plate (to pack in a to go box), she first stopped by a dirty table to clear dishes. She walked back into the kitchen with my childs plate of food in one hand and someone's dirty dishes in the other. Total cross contamination!! YUK!!

It took forever to get anything we ordered. After saying we were not interested in dessert, she proceeded to spend 15 minutes telling us about the new items on the menu. She brought out our check without asking if we would like to split the check. We gave her 2 cards told her to put $X on one card and the balance on the other. When she brought it back, she had done the opposite. A few days later when we looked online at our bank accounts, she did not charge me at all and charged my friends card twice.
It was just a miserable experience and I hope it doesn't speak for the chain as a whole and the types of people they are choosing to hire to represent their brand."}

I *definitely* recommend the trout, it was the best I've ever had. I was expecting Roy's to be sort of chainy and cheap, but it is incredibly classy and unique.

The atmosphere in Roy's is wonderful. Hawaiian meets mid-century modern. Love it. The wait staff was very attentive, and even when they messed up our order (more than once actually), they fixed it immediately so that it wasn't a problem at all. Everything arrived quickly, even though they had a huge party in the next room.

We split the fixed price menu and added an extra appetizer, although we really didn't need it! One order of the fixed price menu is enough for 2 people unless you've just hiked Camelback or something. We started with the calamari, which was perfectly done, and came with a macadamia nut bruschetta-like topping and a spicy dipping sauce. We also had the pork tenderloin on the fixed price menu. Very tasty, but the calamari was better. Our entree was the trout, which as I said was phenomenal. The desert was the cheesecake, which I thought was a little overly rich. But, still, this was the best meal I've had in Ahwatukee/Chandler,"}

The infamous and most popular Reuben sandwich left much to be desired. This restaurant apparently he feels the need to make up for average corned beef by giving you more average corned beef.  The proportion of beef two other ingredients was inadequate.  I had to ask for extra thousand Island dressing just to finish the meat portion of the sandwich, because it was dry and relatively little sauerkraut on top.  

The server suggested I try the turkey sliders, which I believe I might do next time, but I do not believe that I will be ordering the Ruben at Chompie's again.  

Suggestions:
Cleaner restaurant
Ceaner bathrooms
More quality meat
More toppings on the sandwich

We then had the Asian soft tacos which weren't personally my favorite however John loved them. I ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and originally when it came out it was super salty I could barely taste anything else at all. I let our waitress know and she was very quick to fix the issue and brought me out a whole new plate and it was amazing, nice, flaky, and moist it had great flavor. I had also ordered a side of the pesto risotto and that was tasty as well. John ordered the white truffle and black pepper sea scallops which were cooked to a perfect medium as he had asked also served with the risotto. Both meals were so good we had to force ourselves to stop eating just to save room for the pineapple upside down cake which was to DIE for. It was made fresh to order and served with homemade coconut ice cream(which I could of ate a whole bowl of alone lol) Overall I had a great experience here and while there was a little mishap with the mahi mahi at first they were quick to fix it and the manager even came by and apologized and took care of our dessert for us."}

Greeted quickly by the female bartender working, and drinks and food were served in a timely manner. 

We ordered Thai lettuce wraps and fire roasted artichoke, and both were amazing. Couldn't of been happier with our decisions. 

What bothered me was not being offered another drink well after I was done with my first and about to take my last bite of dinner, so I wasn't really in the mood to order another one anymore. Next, I looked at my bill and was charged for the more expensive of the two wines when I had asked just for the house wine which would be the cheapest of the two at most places, so I was kind of disappointed that she decided to just give and charge me what she wanted. It was only $2 more and the wine was actually very good, so I didn't mention it since I had finished the wine, if I had ordered another, maybe I would have brought it up. 

Female bartender leaves and now left with the male who was working the well the majority of the time we were there. He's very nice and checks to see if we want dessert. I tell him I'm going to look, and decide to just order espressos for my fiancé and myself. Five minutes go by after ordering and I excuse myself to the bathroom. I come back and still no espressos, and he says they are being checked on... Now well over 15 minutes, he says they are being checked on.. Comes back to tell us they aren't ready... 25 minutes go by.... Tells us again they aren't ready but ensures us that they are coming. I'm over the espressos. I ask him to cancel and rering my card without them. I go outside and 5 minutes later my fiancé tells me they are there. I appreciate getting them being taken off but I honestly didn't want them anymore and they were not very hot, and not offered any sugar or spoon for the drinks. It wasn't the bartenders fault but just disappointed in 30 minute espressos... And pretty upset that it took longer to get the espressos than the time it took to order and eat our dinner...

My fiancé said the manager came over and apologized for the espresso while I was outside, and had removed them from our bill, but didn't seem to want to make up for taking so long on what should of been a quick after dinner drink.."}

The cabbage roll was a bit sweet and the potato pancake was dry.  I tried my friend's home fries and it didn't have much flavoring.  The glazed carrots were tasty though.  It was my first visit so maybe I should have tried the matzo ball soup instead."}

We waited for about fifteen minutes for our waitress to come over, and when she did it was to take a quick drink order and rushed off. We had to flag her down again to order our dinner, which was probably about twenty minutes after that. 

We sat many times with empty drinks, and as the restaurant began to clear out we thought the service would improve. We were sorely mistaken. The icing on the cake was when she never came back to see if anyone else wanted a dessert (one person at our table ordered the pineapple upside down cake which takes longer to cook so it is ordered with dinner), and when she delivered the dessert she asked if anyone else wanted one. Really? 

It was such a disappointing dining experience, and sadly we will probably not go back. Pricey and poor service is not a good combination."}

We came in for the second time on 5/9/15 to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, and Mother's Day. The food was good, but our server was a bit awkward and pushy, which I was not fond of. 

I asked him if the lobster bisque risotto was more of a full dish of risotto, or if the risotto was merely a side--he responded by telling me all about the Ono fish. I had to ask my question again and he still wasn't getting it. I did end up ordering the dish and he said that I should have the fish cooked medium, I responded that, "Unfortunately, I cannot have any undercooked food because I am pregnant and it's not safe for the baby. I need it well done please." Again he insisted that the chef recommends it only cooked to medium, and I became very frustrated at this point and told him, "I don't care what the chef recommends. I'm pregnant and cannot eat it unless it's well done."

If I have to tell you TWICE of my consumption needs and you still don't get it and insist on me eating it a different way, I'm not happy. Under normal circumstances, I would love to have sushi or medium-cooked fish instead of a well-done filet. But when I tell you I'm pregnant, stop trying to force a piece of food down my throat that could make me sick and possibly terminate my pregnancy!!! 

Also, the risotto was severely undercooked--I love risotto and pastas to be Al dente, as they're meant to, but this was completely raw grains of rice in some areas. 

5/19/15 UPDATE: After posting my review, I was promptly contacted by managers from the restaurant to discuss the issues we had, which translated into better informing employees about sensitivity with pregnant womens' diets and not trying to force undercooked food on them. We were also sent a very generous giftcard to give the restaurant another try, which we will. The service we've received from the management staff has earned them another "star" in my rating"}

If you have aged eyes as I do, bring reading glasses and a light! It's dim in this place. I could hardly read the menu without assistance. Lol
I ordered a 'slimilicious' veggie salad. It sounded good, however, it had very little flavor. I had to dress it with the light salad dressing, that came on the side, just to add flavor.  It was bland. I've definitely had better. If they had grilled the veggies it would have moved it up a notch. It was boring to my tastebuds. 
My friend ordered the nachos and I will say they were pretty good. They were toasted before serving, making them very crispy and yummy.  
The restroom was relatively clean and stalls were private and well supplied. 
I'm sure I'll return though I do wish they'd come up with a gluten free low fat/sugar cheesecake. Then again......I guess cheesecake should be a deviliscious temptation"}

When I came at 11:30 to pick up my cake, they did not have my name on any order, and they did not have any whole cakes defrosted.  The cashier took my order right there and gave me the requested cake, but then proceeded to ask me "Are you going to eat this cake right now?"  Telling her that our party was at noon, she proceeded to tell me "You are going to have to wait 1.5 hours for the cake to defrost."  What??  She did add in a quick "Sorry" but in that "Sorry, but deal with it" tone.  Due to this location's poor planning and bad customer service, we were unable to have the cake for the lunch party.  Since we were at work, we could not wait 1.5 hours for it to defrost since we only had a small block of time to serve it and eat.  I'm never getting anything from this location again, and if you get anything to go, I'd be wary of ordering any whole cakes from them."}

I think I'm used to be greeted better? By the hostess and the waiters? Specially at this kind of restaurants where yo pay $60-70 per person right?
And well I was expecting at least more friendly and attentive service.

The ambience is just ok, nothing fancy, and dark, very dark I hate how the pictures from the food came out...

Also I can tell the place must be old and they haven't invest in renovations for a while... the ceiling had some problems with the rain or the a/c I wasn't able to tell but there was a hole on the ceiling and the paint was coming off... one of the plates that I got was really scratched and still being used..I mean I will not complain if this is a Hole in the Wall cheap kind a restaurant...but we are paying right? 
The music was annoying, very repetitive and the rhythm was accelerated like music that you hear at a fast food place... I don't know I was expecting a more relaxed and soft kind of music...
We visited on a Sunday, arrived at 4:30 by 5:00 the place started to get more costumers and became noisy...so keep that in mind. Besides that the kitchen is on a corner and they don't have doors which makes you listen all the noise of the cooking and the handling of the plates...yeah my romantic dinner was romantic because of my husband, that's it the environment didn't help it to make it a perfect celebration how I expected.

The food was salty and I wish they added more vegetables

It was lovely because nobody was there and we got the whole dining area to ourselves. But the best part was just the food. The service was pretty good to say a little more.

I had trouble choosing because the menu is quite extensive, but I finally chose an artichoke spinach omelette with a bagel on the side. I was in bagel heaven. My friends both had sandwiches. My partner had the beef brisket and said it was to die for. My girlfriend had a pastrami. It was piled so high she wasn't sure how she was going to add her mouth around it. It was flavored just right and she said it was amazing. They also bring a little plate of pickles to put in the middle of the table. The cool thing was there was several varieties. 

Lately I have been out for breakfast or brunch several times and this is the best omelette I think I've had in a long time. It had succulent artichokes, lots of spinach and just a really good fresh flavor with spice. My bagel was toasted and buttered. Even when I was almost full I completely finished it it was so crunchy and chewy. I live in Tucson and I haven't been able to get my bagel craving satisfied. This one did it for me. I'll be back for sure!
In fact, We all left quite satisfied."}

I came here with the party of about 15 a few nights ago and was thoroughly impressed with how accommodating they were to our needs. They were quick to seat us, bring us waters and provide us with bread while we waited for the entire party to arrive. They checked back frequently for all of us to arrive and was ready and waiting to take our order when we were all present. Also, they had no problem initially separating our checks during ordering so we wouldn't have to worry about splitting the check later on. Which was GREATLY appreciated and made checking out that much easier. Now, everyone knows how overwhelming Cheesecake's book of a menu is. I didn't mind waiting for our late friends because it takes that long to decide what to order. They also have a separate "SKINNYLICIOUS" menu that I've never seen before! This is news to me. We are usually pretty healthy eaters but this particular night was a "cheat" day for us. We ordered off the regular menu: fried avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom starter and the avocado egg roll appetizer. They were both great. In attempt to be somewhat healthy, I ordered the almond crusted salmon kale salad on the regular menu and this dish is not good at all. I gave it a chance and took a few bites hoping that the salmon flavor would kick in or the dressing would save it but I didn't taste anything. It was very bland. I had to ask the waiter to take it back because I didn't even want to take it home. I hate doing that and wasting food but I had to and he was so nice to take it off our bill. Thank you so much, I really appreciated it. Thank goodness my fiancé ordered the salmon and steak plate because it was enough for both of us to share and the flavor profile of this dish was wonderful. The steak flavor reminded me of adobo and the salmon was cooked to perfection. I had no more room for dessert which was a bummer because I love almost every dessert I've ever tried here. But I did have the privilege of trying my friends lemon cake/strawberry cheesecake and it was SO GOOD. I will need to get it the next time I go in. I also like that Cheesecake Factory is one of the few restaurants who stays open late. I'm not big on chain restaurants but Cheesecake Factory is always a viable option in my book."}

He said everything tasted good and he had no complaints. I had a bite of his corned beef hash and I totally agreed with him. Plenty of corned beef and seasoned really well.

The biggest complaint - OVERPRICED!!!!  $70 for lunch for 5 is stupid expensive.  The portions are really big, but taking a to-go box in Phoenix in the summer just isn't possible.  I would rather have paid less and gotten half as much food.

There isnt a thing on the menu that I dont like.. I havent tried everything.. but whenever friends from out of town come in.. This is one of my first suggestions.. My fav is the butterfish.. and the pineapple dessert.. all the other things are wonderful ... In other words... your not gonna go wrong here. Hey its Roy Yamaguchi..  for Gods sake.. and he can fuse and cook like no other.."}

Bread is always good, and the new celebration cheesecake is a must try to anyone contemplating ordering it.

I wanted to go light and the Pastrami sandwich selections did look marvelous but I opted for the Sheila's (I think that is the name) BBQ Chicken salad instead.  This was very tasty although the price was a little overwhelming with only three strip pieces of chicken in the salad.  I think for 13 bucks a few more pieces of meat could have been offered.

The manager stopped by to mention she understood us to say this was our first visit and she mentioned the weekly specials.  Was very nice although bad timing.. we had just been served and honestly, we both just wanted to dig in already and playing pleasantries with the manager was difficult.  

We did need to ask another server for our check but I'm sure this was due to our server being spread a little thin in sections.  We left her a sizeable tip as she did deserve it in our opinion.

We left satisfied and will return again for another selection on the menu."}

We arrived for early dinner on Sunday evening, the wait wasn't long about 10 mins so we got a glass of wine at the bar while we waited.  We got seated on the patio shortly after but we ended up leaving the restaurant after waiting 25 mins for a server to attend our table.  During this time neither of the two servers working the patio made eye contract with us. Eventually the servers busily joined tables near to us to accommodate a party of 5, as soon as the party were seated the server attended their table, we got up and left.  On the way out we stopped by hostess stand to ask to speak to a manager, at first the hostess' saw us but turned back and continued their conversation, eventually we got their attention and spoke to the Manager whose name was Robert.  I explained what happened and he apologized, didn't offer to make up for the poor service and could only say sorry.... This isn't acceptable....  

We returned this evening for dinner for a friends Birthday, Cheesecake Factory was their choice not ours!  Since we still had the $50 gilft card to use we agreed to go...  This time things were a little smoother although while checking in we didn't get asked for our preference of seating.  I ordered dinner and asked for half to be boxed before bringing my plate out, the server said that would be fine.  When my food arrived it looked like a really big portion... I was disappointed my dinner hadn't been split as I requested.  The server stopped by and said she will bring my boxed portion out later.  Great I thought as the portion I had was quite generous.  As I was finishing my dinner the server came back with my to go box, it contained half a portion of rice.... no chicken or shrimp...  Unbelievable! why would she think I that I wanted to take half a portion of rice home... besides rice is the last thing that you want to take home in a togo box as it can harbor bacterial really fast if not refrigerated right away or when not heated up properly...  

Really disappointing! will not be going back!  There are tons of great restaurants around, no need to spend money here and be disappointed."}

Ordered appetizers, entrees, dessert. The summer sangria was awesome, really nice drink, well mixed.  Appetizers came out, decent presentation but NO PLATES .....glazed ribs too messy to eat over myself or the cloth table cover. Just was awkward trying to eat until finally flagged someone down. 

Hand cut sirloin with corn/chile mash potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was cooked, nicely seasoned.... Mash was a nice bold flavor contrast. 

Teppanyaki shrimp.... BLAH.  Shrimp were 30-40 size and tasted and looked like they came out of a bag of imported frozen shrimp from Walmart. Bland and severely disappointing. Fried rice was mushy and bland again, like a Bird's Eye microwave bag of rice and vegetables. 

Dessert.... Molten chocolate lava cake with ice cream and raspberry cheese cake.... Might serve the same thing at Red Robin.   I would have hoped for an island dessert, something more related to the "Hawaiian" menu. 

Doubt will ever go back.  I think some may think I'm crass but for $100 for two people it should have been somewhat a special experience."}

I have lived in AZ for almost 25 years.  My conservative estimate is that I have dined out at least 100 times at The Cheesecake Factory.  I can say that the last 100 times the food was great and the service was as well.  Tonight at the Chandler location was horrible.  At 8:50, we sat down outside on the patio.  My wife was happy since it was cold inside.  
We ordered a blue moon, a Caesar salad, and two chicken dishes. Mine was the spicy cashew chicken, that I have probably had 50 times.  Well, the photo attached is my empty plate that I stared at for over 20 minutes after getting our bread.  No salad, no additional bread and no ask if we want another drink for well over 20 minutes.   I finally flag someone serving water and ask where our salad is and bread.  We finally get the salad and more bread.  it and about that same time, our waitress informs us she is going home for the night and someone else would be handling us.  I'm thinking great.  Well eventually my food comes and another first for me at CF.  My spicy cashew chicken is over cooked and burnt/extra crispy.  I  aske the waitress if this is normal and she says absolutely.  Well, even though I know different I just go with it. yes it is usually crispty but not like this. It taste terrible.    Well I hear the table next to me complaining about his steak being way over cooked and tasting terrible. I ask him and he says yes.  I just want out of here at this point.  After I pay my bill, I tell my waitress you might want to pass on to the manager that the kitchen having problems tonight. She responds I would have had it remade if you wanted.  Well when I asked If this was normal you said yes.  You never offered to remake it you simply quickly replied yes.  I hope this is not the new norm because I have always loved CF and have had many a work party here as well. #tonightwasterrible."}

The heavy traffic makes for bathrooms that seem like they should be at a street festival or state fair.

I recommend grabbing your baked goods or bagels and heading home to enjoy them...far from the chaos and grime."}

You can't really go wrong with anything on their menu, though my favorites are their skillets. Nearly every dish here comes with a bagel and cream cheese, and you really can't go wrong with any of them. And guys, they have a CRAGEL - croissant bagel. This is not a drill. Throw some honey almond or strawberry cream cheese on there and I'm in heaven! They also have a couple solid breakfast specials during the week if anyone is thrifty like me - standard eggs/potatoes/bagel or bagel and lox. Make sure you stop by their deli/bakery counter for some goodies before you leave - the cannoli and the rugulach are SO GOOD.

Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.

The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  

For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  

Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night."}

Makes sense, since the family that owns Chompie's is from Queens. 

Since then, he finds any excuse he can to go, and we've had a variety of delicious items: the aforementioned soup; turkey sandwich; turkey dinner; potato knish; Mish Mosh Soup (Matzoh Ball, Chicken Noodle, and Kreplach mixed!) rainbow cookies, black & white cookies (free with Yelp! check in) Linzer tarts, butter cookies, fruit tart, onion strings, and kashe varnishkes. Only the last two disappointed: the strings were oil logged, and Scott didn't care for the varnishkes. 

I had their bagels a few years ago when I was in Scottsdale for a conference, and they were super. They offer a wide variety of flavors, gluten free options, and lots of delicious cream cheese varieties. Their lox and whitefish offerings are stellar. They have extensive catering options and make custom cakes for special occasions. 

They serve Gulden's mustard :) We are fans!

A rich, buttery sensational taste that is not for the calorie conscious, but that's what it takes to get flavor in any dish.   Lately, I've been enjoying their burgers.  Today I had the Classic burger which was simply one of the better burgers I've ever had.  A side of blue cheese smothered salad and I was in heaven.  Service always depends on the server you get.

I sat at the bar, though small, it obviously wouldn't be a place I would sit and have a few drinks after work. I was reminded by the manager that they now have a happy hour with $1 off drafts! Good to know. 

I had the Hot Pastrami sandwich with a cup of Tortilla Soup. The size of pastrami was very generous and I barely finished half. The pastrami was stacked 3 inches high and was so tender and juicy. I liked that it had a nice crust of peppery goodness on the edge of each slice. Slap that on Jewish Rye and you're in business!  The soup was good, not great, but good. I don't think it had enough flavor, it was missing a hint of spice and more generous pieces of chicken. It didn't stand out to me.

My only gripe was the NY prices. Out the door with tip was $21, so not an average lunch. I think that would be the only reason why I wouldn't frequent this place more often. Jason's Deli is right across the street and whereas Chompie's pastrami sandwich is better, sadly I don't think it is that much better to warrant the price. 

I'd definitely give it a go. Next time I'll try a reuben!"}

This review isn't about that. This is based on my incredibly disappointing dining experience.
I ordered the peppered shrimp and plantains and I was really excited because it had plantains and I love plantains. But when it came-- late I may add-- there were no plantains. Finally I flagged down the waiter and asked where the plantains were. He said they were "backed up" and he would bring them second. So, I waited. And waited. And waited. Twenty something minutes later, my plantains came. Everyone else had already eaten. My food was then cold. 
I know it wasn't my waiter's fault, but my food did not come out as it was supposed to. And when I asked to have it comped, he acted like I was being ridiculous. He made a face at me and all but refused to send a manager over.
If you don't love plantains like I do, it might be hard for you to understand, but basically I paid 20$ for shrimp and plantain curry and got only shrimp. To me, it was not unlike ordering nachos and having them come without the cheese. Or ordering a salad and having it come without the dressing. Not acceptable."}

They have really good everything. Sandwiches and breakfast items. They have a lox and bagel platter for two that is great. Their pastrami sandwiches are awesome. So good. We have ordered sandwiches for meetings for work from here and at lest one person has be come addicted to them.
This time I had been craving pancakes for awhile and I had some time off and was looking for a good place to fulfill my craving. I remembered Chompie's had good pancakes. So off I went. What a great choice. I got the Breakfast of Champions which is two pancakes, eggs and bacon. I also got a side of sourdough toast. Boy did that hit the spot. It was so good I ate all of it. Don't think I ate anything else the rest of the day. The pancakes were nice and fluffy just what I had been craving.
They also bring out a pickle sampler plate with some new pickles and regular pickles. They are so good.
I will definitely be back to order more bagels, lox, pancakes, sandwiches and everything. Oh the pastries in the case are to die for too if you have any room left."}

Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I was neither friends nor family at that point (I was discussing a book event with Wendy), though in typical tribal fashion I was adopted by the Borensteins and made mischpucha (translate: family for the non-Yiddish speaking and goyem). Anyway, since that evening I've been there six or eight times. It's always terrific.

Though I always order a lean corned beef on rye, I've had a number of things with family and friends. Everything has been fantastic - the traditional comfort food I ate since emerging from the womb. Though I will caution about the matzo ball soup; it has a sweetness I don't care for. We've had blintzes, latkes, fish, knishes... The list is longer but that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Everything has been terrific.

Same with the service. I've been treated very well every time I've been there. For good or ill there is now a Chompie's closer to my house. The jury is still out on which it is, I mean, nobody ever said a "latke a day keeps the doctor away." You know what I'm sayin'..."}

To start we sat down and didn't have a bowl of creamer for our coffee (no big deal), so we grabbed the one from the table next to us.  The bowl of individually wrapped coffee creamers was COVERED in ants. We told the waitress and handed her the bowl and told her that the table probably needed to be wiped down. She said ok and didn't even look at the table. We told her again thinking she was just busy but she still didn't even look at the table. Then they sat people
At a table infested with ants without even a wipe down. Blah. Next we ordered the Chompies Benedict and it was disgusting. It really looked like they slapped an egg on a bagel with a chewy piece of ham and poured cheese-wiz all over it... It was dis-gust-ing.  To make it even worse, the coffee tasted like cigarettes. We left having taken three bites out of our meal and the waitress didn't think twice. We paid the bill and went and ate breakfast somewhere else. It was a sad morning. I would NOT recommend going to this Chompies. Terrible experience."}

Cheesecake factory is ok.  For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said...

I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her.

The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking.

I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo. 

I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad. 

I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic. 

It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant.

Then this past Wednesday it turned out that both Mr. M and I were dressed nicely at the same time (usually I'm working from home in my "Hoptimistic a cold beer is in my future" t-shirt and some old shorts), and we decided to go to Roy's.  I have eaten at several different Roy's, but it's been a few years, and my Mr. had never been to one.  

We started with the surf and turf app from the Chef's Selection menu and this was absolutely delicious.  Two grilled shrimp, cooked perfectly and slightly smoky.  Then there was a 3-4 oz. bacon-wrapped filet on top of a light potato puree.  Oh my.  If we go back anytime soon, I want one of those all to myself.  That disappeared very quickly.  

We also ordered some cocktails and I had the Buffalo Trace Manhattan and he had the Rye Me a River.  Both very nice and well worth their 12 dollar price tag, but remind me to hit their happy hour sometime so I can afford to eat and drink here more often.

Then for our entrees my husband ordered the Himalayan sea salt ribeye off of the Chef's Selection menu and I ordered the Roy's Trio, which our server offered to make into a quad with the addition of the Ahi for $3.95.  Heck yeah!   

We had decided not to take our phones in, and just talk and have a nice meal so I don't have any pictures of the main meal, but suffice it to say, it was all perfect.  The way they prepare the fish here is just amazing to me.  The ahi and the butterfish are so light they melt in your mouth, and the macadamia crusted mahi and salmon are so flavorful.  We also really enjoyed sharing the ribeye which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  

Our server, Anthony, was the most gracious host and when I mentioned we were sharing our food he brought a couple of clean plates right away so we could pass bites across the table, and was very prompt with drink refills.  

We don't usually order dessert, and were too full to have the chocolate soufflé or the pineapple upside down cake while we were there, but I thought it would be nice to take something home for later.  On the specials menu they had carrot cake listed and that always sounds appealing so I ordered a piece to go.  When I asked Anthony if they put whipped cream or anything on it, he said "yeah, they put all kinds of cream and mango or pineapple something on it....."  I asked him if we could just get it plain and he said, "Sure."  He got it all boxed up to go and put it in a bag to carry out.  

When the bill came it was $140.21 before tip, as expected, so I was really glad I had the gift cards.  The only disappointment came when we got home, and I totally take the blame for this.  

When I got home I decided to take a look at the carrot cake and was totally shocked I paid 9 bucks for 2- inch and a half square pieces of plain carrot cake.  See picture.  Nothing else.  No cream cheese frosting.  No nothing.  Ah I should have known.  A great deal of enjoying a meal at Roy's is the presentation.  I'm sure they take these 2 little squares and really doll them up.  9 bucks.  4 bites of cake.  Well, live and learn.  Next time I'll ask more questions or look in the box before I take it out of the restaurant.  Overall, I would definitely go back to Roy's sooner rather than later."}

I've been to Cheesecake Factory many many times and always left satisfied and happy to go back. Our waiter was just ok. First initial meeting he just seemed like he was bothered. When we originally were to be seated we would have been seated in a different section, however we asked for a booth and was seated in his section. Now I don't know if he knew that and that had anything to do with it or what. The food seemed off. You could tell someone different was cooking because I had just been there a week prior and ordered the same thing. The bread on my sandwich was hard and had no flavor (Chicken salad sandwich), my salad was soggy underneath a crisp bed of greens, and my daughters fries were way over cooked. At the end, our waiter packaged up our food. We were going to package up our bread that he had dropped off earlier and didn't get a chance to touch, but was waiting to get back our containers to put it in the bag. As soon as he came back he dropped off the bags and check and reached over me as I was about to grab the bread and took the basket and walked away. My husband and I looked at each other pretty stunned. He watched him grab our bread basket and hand it to another table. First off I'm pretty sure you should not be giving hand me down bread to someone that was just seated. How do they know I haven't touched that? I'm just getting over a cold, what if I had? Completely gross. Also I know it's not required for them to ask if we wanted drinks to go but 75% of the time they do and it's an added bonus that I will definitely tip for. He didn't care. Just wanted us gone. Of course will plan to go back but will definitely ask to move if he is our waiter again."}

They will go to great lengths to seem like they're busy, just so they don't have to help you. On top of that, when they do decide to help someone, they just pick a random person out of the crowd, not who got their first. Second, they are always out of whole cake. I like to buy a cake now and then from them for occasions, but I am better off just going to the Scottsdale location at this point. Third, they are unclean. I watched a chick lick her fingers and then handle my food; that is disgusting. Finally, their pastries don't taste the same as other Chompie's and the chocolate rugelach is always burned.

My wife and I have been coming here almost every week for 10 years now, but last night was our last visit. Once again, the wait staff was completely new. Gone are the old days when we knew the names of our servers and they knew us too (David, Jey, Amanda, Jessica, Zach). So last night, service was slow even though the place was only half full. Other customers were complaining and the servers were saying that they were using a new computer system to track the loyalty points and it was not working. I wasn't buying it because the slow service has become the trend. Again, the servers are doing the best they can. They're just new and overworked. As a result, when we did finally get our food, it was almost cold. Our server did apologize on the wait, even though we did not mention it. 
We will be searching for a new hangout. Chompies of Chandler has become a good candidate for next season's Kitchen Nightmares."}

Although friends of ours rave about the seafood their so I bet it's a great meal as well ! 

Our waitress on the other hand was just okay ! 
As it got busier she seemed to stop by less and less I had an empty glass sitting in front of me for some time ! That's one thing that drives me nuts . Just fill my glass before its empty especially if it's just a simple glass of soda ! I would have tipped her a lot more then I did if she didn't have a waiter in trading or what seemed to be the buss boy offer us dessert and such !

I have never been to NYC so I cannot speak to the authenticity of both the ambiance or the food but its hard to find a good pastrami on rye and I would venture to say that theirs is pretty solid - also I think they offer something like 5 different types of rye bread. Breakfast is good, too. I had the Guanajuato Benedict and the avocado Hollandaise sauce was tasty as well as the chorizo.

We were curious as its hard to find a decent place where we live that isn't an hour long wait looking at folks finishing up their walk of shame in appearance.  Anyway, we were told 20 minutes to be seated it was about 10 at most.  Nice location we were seated and David was our server.  He was humorous and we even joked about some dishes that crashed in the kitchen of which everybody heard.  My husband and I both ordered the Chorizo and cheese omelet which was wonderful but AGAIN a little skimpy on the meat for the price.

I have worked in the food and beverage industry for about ten years so I like to think I am very reasonable when it comes to my expectations as well as being understanding that things will- and do go wrong daily in this business. My last experience at The Cheesecake Factory was unacceptable. I have never felt the need to write a bad review after a bad experience but I feel compelled to address this particular situation in hopes that it will never happen to myself or any other customer again. My boyfriend and I frequent this restaurant as it is one of our favorite places to dine and while out for my birthday a couple weekends ago a series of unfortunate events occurred making it hard to want to ever come back. From the beginning our server seemed like he was in the weeds and struggling to keep up, I could tell because another server asked if he needed help and he was frantic while talking to us and the tables around. Like I mentioned before I have worked in this industry and have served many years so this particular part didn't bother me as much, but maybe he should have more training or an easier section on a Saturday night for the sake of the customers. Where it starts to get messy is after we ordered. I had ordered the four cheese pasta and my boyfriend had ordered the Filet Mignon. I am not sure if things were sent to the kitchen at different times or if there was a mistake in the kitchen because my pasta had been delivered to the table a minimum of 20 minutes before the steak got to the table. I had completely finished my meal (with some help from my boyfriend since he was starving) and was done before a steak came to the table. While very understanding that things happen in restaurants I am baffled by the fact that nobody communicated with us on what had happened. Our server was blatantly ignoring us, avoiding eye contact and didn't explain anything. The whole time this was happening our drinks were empty, never being filled. Finally he came to the table and when my boyfriend had mentioned it was unacceptable all he said was that he was going to send someone over to talk to us, still no explanation on what had happened. A steak finally arrived at our table and he started eating when another worker approached us and said he had received the wrong steak. Not really a problem because it was switched out fairly quick, but still another mistake made by our server. My boyfriend had finished majority of his steak dinner and was done eating so we flagged our waiter and asked for a check. Still a manager hadn't come over to our table and we were completely done eating. At the time we asked for our check I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. Finally a manager came to the table and said he heard there was a timing issue. While I hate creating a scene and ruin other peoples dining experience I didn't say much other then I had been completely done eating before his  food came out. The manager asked if we were getting dessert and I mentioned I had already placed the order. Still we had no explanation of what happened and the managers visit was very short. We were STILL waiting on our check and I could tell that the communication between the manager and our server was very poor. Our server came back still with no check and asked if we wanted the cheesecake to go or for here. I had ordered the cheesecake to go long before the manager came over so I was confused as to why he came back to ask that and it was clear he still hadn't sent the order through. So on top of waiting a unreasonable amount of time on food we spent an even more amount of time just trying to get our check and cheesecake to go and leave the restaurant. In the future I hope the employees at this location communicate appropriately with each other and the guests to avoid situations like these."}

We fix the table ourselves. While there we are repeatedly splashed w/water and as the AZ sun starts to go down BLINDED by it.  DO NOT SIT OUTSIDE the planning was unthoughtful to the diner.
2.  After we order pasta carbonara and grilled shrimp salad we wait for over 45 min.  On top of that the waitress was stingy w/bread (c'mon we were hungry) and gave us no communication about our food.  Meanwhile 6 people have sat after us, received their food and 3 left.  We ask and are told it will be out soon, NO Apologioes
3.  Food arrives...My shrimp are cold, my lettuce is wilted  and the pasta has lil sauce (my hubby always orders the same thing and this was mediocre) and is coagulated.  

We ask for a manager he reluctantly apologizes and after I say I'm not paying offers to take the food off the bill, which I felt no guilt for because we didn't eat it at all....... Thank God for the lil bread that we did get! I will never go back to this location...... Sadly I will have to dine at a "real" Cheesecake factory in LA where they are accustomed to the "brand" a bit better"}

We kind of laughed it off wondering why we were shuttled away to the dark lonely bowels of the restaurant.   I can only guess they have a weird seating chart or the waitress was being punished for some reason.  They were pretty dead so you would think they would want to keep the travel distance to a minimum.  Another group was seated about 10 minutes later across the room from us and they actually had the server move them.

The food was just average at best.  Nothing really stood out on the menu when we were ordering. I got a pretty tasteless Portabella/Goat Cheese salad.  The service we pretty slow, but it might have just been due to the 30 minute hike to our table.  Maybe I'll have to come back by for breakfast."}

High... price, expectations. Still love those ribs, but other apps, mediocre. Pot sticker was equal to frozen grocery store quality.
Medium... service lukewarm, guy had the personality of a turnip. Why be in the serving business if you don't like people? Technically ok, but for $200 I expect a personal touch.
Cocktail was way over sweet. Not balanced.
Low... preparation quality. Macadamia crusted mahi mahi overcooked and tough! Pineapple upside down cake burnt! Butterfish had a fishy taste. Not quite off, but not fresh enough. Portions were adequate.
Have been here in the past, and it's been better. Why would we return?"}

The Baja Burger 14.99 is ridiculous! It could easily feed 2 people or just a hungry teenage boy.

I ordered a half turkey sandwich and had to take a lot of the turkey off so I could actually eat it. Next time I'll order a half and extra bread to make another half. 

The menu is huge so there's something for everyone. Great choice for breakfast or lunch! $5.00 mimosas!

I won't even talk about the food because chains are chains, the food here is no different from the others.

The service here is awful!  I tried something new, didn't like it, ate two bites, and it was promptly taken away by the waitress.  Did she ask if everything was alright?  No.  Did she ask if she could bring out something else?  No.  Did she take it off the bill?  No.  I just assumed that was Cheesecake Factory policy, as I had never experienced only eating a couple bites of a dish here before.  What bothered me was how rude she was about everything and how slow it took her to bring out the dessert menu after we asked for it (even though I've memorized the cheesecake offerings, I still need to look at them to pick one out).

For dessert we had the new special cheesecake, pistachio with chocolate waves.  Blah."}

The inside is nothing special. Old tables and chairs spaced out in an awkward fashion. 
Upon arriving you walk into the bakery!!! So the bakery treats look delectable- I had a sample of a delicious Danish. 
For my dinner I chose blueberry pancakes which I wasn't impressed by.  A scarce amount of berries in the center only of a huge pancake that filled the plate. The portion was generous but I make better pancakes at home! Plus I *thought* there would be blueberry syrup but nope it's regular maple syrup so that was disappointing too. It's kinda expensive in my opinion too. My 2 stack of pancakes were $12. Kids meals were "ok", again great portions but lacking in taste. 
My friend had sliders which honestly looked amazing- especially the western version. If I ever return I'll have that but doubt I'll give it a second try."}

I returned to my table where my friends were waiting & said we needed to leave as I was ill... They had already paid the bill.  Then as we are exiting the Manager stops me to let me know the GF waffle iron is by itself & not used otherwise.  I graciously tried to say "things happen" & asked they watch more carefully... 
  NEVER did the Manager offer any consideration in the form of a partial refund, a gift certificate to come back, ANYthing that would try to retain me as a customer!!

We decided to go to the bar area to sit because we wanted to get some happy hour drinks and apps along with our dinner.  ALL of the tables were dirty.  The one that we sat at that was set was even dirty.  I used one of the napkins to wipe the table off myself.  The waiter came and took our drink and appetizer order.  He brought us our drinks and then we never saw him again.  I had asked him for a straw which he never brought.  We tried grabbing his attention several times and he just ignored us.  Another person came to bring us our food, and we asked her for a straw and she immediately brought us one.  We were done eating and just decided we wanted to go because the service was so horrible.  No one came to check up on us to see if our food was okay, or if we needed anything.  Other customers were complaining by us as well, which made things even worse.  We happened to snag who we thought was a manager and asked for our check.  We said we had tried getting our servers attention several times, but he wasn't apologetic at all.  About 10 minutes later the waiter finally just laid the check on the table and walked away. Didn't say anything to us.  It just makes me upset when I see servers just sitting in the back areas goofing off with each other and ignoring their customers.  It really ruined our very rare dinner that we had together and we are going to think twice next time we go out to eat.  We have always loved going to cheesecake factory, but after this visit, it seems like things are going downhill for the restaurant and it's very sad.  I wish that I could have tipped the girl who brought our food out because she did more than anyone else in this restaurant did.

It's chicken with bacon, mushrooms, onions, garlic in a thick white wine Riesling sauce served with buttered Parmesan pasta! The BOMB!#A new fav!

Real cornbeef, Dr Browns, cream soda.  I have died and gone to heaven. The wait staff are, polite, aim to please and know the menu.   Chompies

She also sat us in the half booth section in the center of the restaurant despite it being late with other seats available. This seat was particularly obnoxious as we were right next to the server order station and numerous servers "hung out" there to chat with each other and put in orders. Since there is no boundary between the server station and the seat, it's like a group standing over you and looking at you from your left side, squelching any chance at a private conversation with your dining companion. I probably won't come to this location again. I don't remember this same set up at the phoenix location. If it is the same hopefully they at least have a plant or something to break the line of sight from the server station down into the half booth."}

So the waitress acknowledges that yes indeed he ordered it without orange zest and sends it back. Out comes the manager to further clarify that he didn't want orange zest. Offers a side salad or soup on the house. Meanwhile I'm more than halfway through my meal which tastes fine ... A little on the dry side but I always get it but at that point I felt bad eating in front of my fiancé so I pause for a bit. A bit turns into 20 minutes he still hasn't gotten his food yet and at this point I want a box for mine. Usually when a customer hasn't eaten there food or touched it after chowing down it... usually constitutes the need for a box. Nope...everyone else around us got boxes. I try to get the waitresses attention but all I got was an eye roll.

Can't not order my chicken Madeira and luckily enough they have a combo with it so I could also try the Steak Diane.

Her salmon was a little overcooked but that she would get it again because the lemon sauce was really really good.

To our surprise, they didn't have their regular menu, even though there was no mention of a special menu on the website or on Open Table.  The starter that my wife and I both chose was the coconut shrimp.  The flavor was delicious.  My wife's was cooked perfectly.  Mine was dark brown, severely overcooked, and tough.  The clam chowder was not at all a traditional clam chowder, and was delicious, as well.  My butterfish entrée was cooked perfectly, but so oversauced that I had to scrape everything off it to eat it.  The flavor of the sauce literally drowned any butterfish flavor.  My wife's Mahi Mahi tasted "fishy" and was tough and hard to chew.  The chocolate soufflé for dessert was excellent.  Service was quite good, after we asked the waiter to slow things down - otherwise, it was rushed, rushed, rushed in an effort to turn tables.  Disappointingly, the ambiance was dreadful - many tables in what was one sparsely decorated large room - as if you were in a convention hall.  We've eaten in Roy's in Pebble Beach, Chicago, and Orlando.  We will go back to those as they were excellent.  We will avoid Roy's Chandler forever.

However, when he told me that he was going to Scottsdale AND that there's a Roy there, I asked him to book my ticket immediately and I would clear my schedule!!  We live in Charlotte, NC and the closed Roy's is 6.5 hours away!  Shameful!

Let me preface the 4 star rating by saying that it really should be 4.5 stars, but that's not an option (Hello, Yelp...get with the .5 star ratings already!).  I really wanted it to be a "5" experience, but it didn't quite live up to the 5 star stellar perfection of the experience that we had at Roy's in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii.  If the Miso Butterfish (one of Roy's Signature dishes on the menu at all of their locations) was prepared exactly as it was in Waikiki, then I would have given 5 stars, no problem!  Everything else about this visit was spot-on, but the difference in the fish had to take it down to 4 stars.  

We arrived early for our reservation so we waited at the bar and enjoyed delicious drinks and an appetizer from the Happy Hour Menu until our table was ready.  My husband had the Mango Mojito and I had the Hawaiian Martini.  Both of them were strong and delicious.  The Hawaiian Martini was my favorite drink of the week!  I ordered the Happy Hour Tempura Crusted Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  Easily, the most delicious thing I ate all week....and I ate some really good food in AZ that week!!!  The Bartender was new to that location so he was still learning the ropes.  He was SO nice, very friendly, and very attentive.  He's going to do great there!

Our table opened up just as we finished our appetizer.  We were seated at a nice table that had great view of the dining room.   My husband ordered the Bing Cherry stuffed Pork Tenderloin.  It was beautifully plated, seasoned perfectly, and was moist and delicious.  He was very pleased.  The Apple & Goat Cheese Potatoes Au Gratin were also excellent.  As mentioned earlier in my post, I ordered the Miso Butterfish.  It was very good, but it wasn't the sublime dish that I had in Waikiki Beach.  The flavors were only marginally different, but enough to make a difference.  We ordered the Kona Coffee Creme Brulee for dessert, but it was a bit too strong tasting for my liking.

Service was excellent, attentive, and timely.  The restaurant is very pretty and the overall ambiance is inviting and upscale, but still comfortable and not stuffy.  It was a great meal and a lovely dining experience.  I would definitely go back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone."}

Let me break this down for you...

We entered the restaurant and it was very busy but we didn't have to wait long to be seated and we did get a nice booth. The menu is vast that's the only way I could put it for my first time there I was just overwhelmed by the choice's they offered. I ended up getting the Cajun Chicken, my grandmother had a Meatloaf sandwich both came with potato fries. My Cajun Chicken which was supposed to be HOT was delicious but it was less than mild. My grandmother said her meatloaf wasn't very flavor full, I didn't try it but I would take her word for it. The restaurant was very loud and my grandmother is 80 years old so it was difficult for her to converse with me. 

The portions are huge neither of us were able to finish our plates, I personally don't care for giant portions. You will be assaulted with food at every turn in this place which makes sensible choices difficult. Chompies, honestly, it reminded me of an upscale Denny's. Better food, but atmosphere was exactly the same... If you've ever been in a typical Denny's you'll know exactly what that comparison means. Our server wasn't the best, we felt neglected at times and she was very pushy for us to hurry and place our order. 

Overall, my first impression of Chompies was not a good one and I'm still on the fence about weather or not I would return."}

I never had anything but a positive experience, but then a change occured a few months back. First, it was subtle, a few menu items changed pages or went missing from what was a frankly over-sized menu in the first place, so nothing to worry about. Then, one day the menu had changed from 6 or so pages with extra inserts for even more items to 3 pages in total. This was a welcome change at first, even if it meant losing some items I actually liked.

As we looked closely, however, I realized slowly that almost nothing was missing. They had crammed in margins on every page, taking at least two pages of menu items and practically hiding half of them in the margins. This was not a good sign. It said to me they were almost entirely doing this to reduce the cost of printing menus. It also may have resulted from complaints from the employees, which were starting to become noticeably aged. I'm not saying that an older man/woman can't be a good waitress, but when a restaurant suddenly goes from 90% wait staff in their 20s to 90% women in their 60s it just says to me again that they're cutting costs.

Now, cost-cutting is part of doing business, because you can't always make enough money and that demands action. But that would be with a failing or struggling restaurant. This Chompie's location, however, RARELY had open seating from sun up to sun down. It was always packed with paying customers, so they clearly had no need of cutting corners.


This brings me to the food itself. Chompie's has gone from the most consistently delicious deli-style food in town, to hands down the worst. This occured within the span of 2 months, which I can only assume coincides with a change in management. It's so bad, now, that during my last visit the Jewish Sliders which normally come with a rich, thick brown gravy were instead served with a blatantly cut gravy served lukewarm at best. It was so thin, that by comparison, if it was the same gravy at all, it would've been 10% gravy and 90% water, which I wish was an exageration, but it just isn't. You could see the bottom of the cup through it! And the brisket, which is normally cooked to perfection was clearly microwaved and so old I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled it off other uneaten sandwiches.

This is the new quality of this chompie's location, and I would warn anyone to stay away and let them go out of business, because they're no longer interested in having customers. They've proven that much."}

This is my first review for this location, where you can occasionally find me at lunchtime.  

The variety of menu options to choose from at any Chompie's is mind-boggling. Every now and then I will try something new, but I usually end up ordering the Times Square New Yorker with pastrami because it's my favorite. Like most of their sandwiches, it arrives piled high with enough pastrami to satisfy the hungriest customer. It does not disappoint. 

One day I got brave and ordered the Texas Longhorn burger. For the uninitiated, this beast is a half-pound burger topped with smoked brisket, cheddar cheese and coleslaw. I'm not a real big fan of topping burgers with other types of meats - but this thing was amazing! Tender, juicy and great flavor. I would recommend this to any burger fan, but do not - I repeat - do not, eat this if you have somewhere to be afterwards. This sandwich will take you down. I'm not kidding. Like you will need a nap to let your body recover. And probably some cholesterol medication. 

On my last visit here our server brought us samples of the apple strudel, which was really good. I will definitely order this on a future visit. 

Now, with the good comes the bad - and there is one issue here that I see I'm not alone in experiencing. SERVICE! At this location during the lunch hour, my co-workers and I have just sat at the table waiting for anyone to come take our drink/food order. On other occasions, the server is prompt and on top of everything - but it took an eternity for our food to arrive. Very inconsistent. It has reached a point where we now tell the server upon our arrival that we are in a hurry - just to get normal service.

The food here is amazing - I love this place. But they need to figure out their service issues here. I would have given them a 4-5 star review, but I'm not going to give them a pass on this. I'll be back again - let's see if they can address what myself and other reviewers clearly recognize as an issue."}

Now granted, we came as guests for a Yelp Elite event. So full disclosure, they were probably at their best. That being said, they went above and beyond to show us just how delicious their food was, and how accommodating and friendly they were. I was able to sample three of their sliders, and have to say the corned beef as to die for. All their deserts and cookies were excellent. But what stood out the most for me was the bagels. I'm not a big bagel person myself but their strawberry bagels are one of the best things I've had the pleasure of devouring. I could pretty much eat those for 1000 years. 

Highly recommend this place if you want some great comfort deli food. :)"}

Maybe it was because we were there on a Thursday at 3:30pm so there wasn't much traffic, but signature Jewish Sliders we ordered came out in less than 15 minutes.

I found out about this place from the Man v Food episode and the sliders looked amazing online. Finally trying them myself I have to say they were pretty good but didn't live up to the hype, I would give them 3.5/5. The gravy sauce or ranch dressing is necessary for the slider otherwise it won't have too much flavor. The meat is cooked beautifully and fairly tender. The onion strings side were fantastic (4/5) and go really well with the ranch sauce. We also ordered one Western style slider just to try and I ended up liking that one more. We also got a mini carrot cake, which I would give a solid 5/5. The food + service and speediness which I would give  5/5 compels me to give this place 4/5 overall."}

Let's get that out of the way. If you eat meat and you're here for the bagels, go for it.

I'm a vegetarian. I like the egg and cheddar on a toasted bagel without meat. On 5 separate occasions spread out over a couple months in a row, I ordered the egg and cheddar on a bagel. Every time, they added bacon to it. A few times, they just tried to pull the bacon off the cheese (with little bits of bacon embedded in it still). The first time I had to call the manager and have it refunded on my card. He promised it wouldn't happen again.

The next time, I checked in the car before I walked out. Bacon.

The next three times, I checked in the store AND asked the cashier to please go tell the chefs not to put bacon on it. All three times, they put bacon on the sandwich. Are you kidding me??

I really don't think they're intentionally deciding to put bacon on a sandwich that they know is intended for a vegetarian. I think they just don't pay attention and don't care. And apparently the manager and cashier don't care either. I'm definitely one to give many chances to fix a mistake, but clearly this is just the attitude of this place. It's a bummer - I like the bagels better than Einsteins and other local shops, but how can I endorse a place that's either disrespectful to me or vegetarians?"}

Roast beef kinda the same, like its a solution soaked piece of meat before cooking, hell, even Jersey Mikes does a better Roast Beef, its got FLAVOR.

Someone told me that the sandwiches were awesome especially their chopped liver. Firstly the menu is just humongous it took me a good 10 minutes just to scan it. On finding the chopped liver sandwich I ordered that but made the error of asking the waitress for the accompanying bread (which she suggested as rye). SO I ended up ordering the half chopped liver with rye.

The chopped liver was piled quite high but the sandwich was quite small for the 7 bucks. However I like small portions so this didn't bother me too much Mimi's across the 101 serves similar portions and I don't ind paying for it. However the combination of the sweet rye and gamey chopped liver made the sandwich rather disgusting.

Hostess finally saw us waiting and took our name and said it'd be a few minutes. A party ahead of us got seated by the manager. While heading back to the front, he stops to chat up a girl server. Then walks past me to the bar to chat up the bar tender. STRIKE 2.

The restaurant was not crowded on Mother's Day which was a sign.
There were lots of employees standing around, picking each other up, chatting, etc. but not doing anything else. Our waiter forgot what my daughter ordered for her drink and ignored my son, who had just arrived and had not ordered yet.
The food took forever to come, it was freezing in the restaurant and my husband needed more coffee but none was offered. We asked for a refill on my daughter's drink and for more coffee. There were only 2 place settings for our party of 4 and we had to ask for more. 
The mashed potatoes were awful. Neither one of my kids ate them.
Two of us had omelets which were good. My son had a latke burger which was really good and my daughter had chicken and Matzo balls (dumplings) which she wasn't impressed with.
One of the reasons we went to Chompies was for the Mother's Day gift of a slice of white cake with raspberry filling. Found out at the end of the meal that it only came with the Mother's Day dinner which was $19.95. Our waiter actually giggled when he said I couldn't have it.
As we were paying he came out with a piece of the cake. Said they had lots of it so it redeemed him a little bit. Overall, a very disappointing outing."}

Now for the fun stuff so listen up management and upper echelons who design a menu. Why in the name in Vishnu do you put a brioche bun, filled tithe brim with dairy and eggs? The impossible burger represents a step towards plant based protein, the future of veganism. So is this an attempt to stymie vegans, by putting your animal cruelty product with a cruelty free product? Who designs these menus?

"we don't have a allergen menu in the store."

What? Why? This is the twenty first century. What establishment, let alone a huge chain, not have an advanced menu for allergy sensitive people? My father in law is allergic to nuts. Why can't he be informed? I'm lactose intolerant, so if I ask what's in the bread, it's because I'd like to not be sick to stomach when I eat your bread. Real common courtesy right?

Don't get me started on the secret sauce. Why does it have eggs? Mix mustard and ketchup and call it a secret, but Mayo isn't a secret. Vegans will not appreciate being told they don't  know what's in the sauce and have to ask for the chef.

So we asked so many questions and didn't get answers we wanted we called for the chef. Our server told us that all bread had milk and eggs I it. Well yours don't, maybe y'all should do some basic ingredients training with your staff. The chef cleared everything up. What a life guard in this strange place. Knew what was in everything and help make suggestions to order. I really wish our server wasn't in such an uncomfortable position. Please explain the gluten free and vegan have nothing in common. Milk and eggs or wheat? Don't suggest a vegan a gluten free option. It's kinda insulting. Everyone knows corn and rice don't hold up like wheat does. Most vegans live off of carbs.

The Hibachi Salmon was cooked to perfection which Arizonians seem to love to over-cook.  The Blackened Ahi was moist.  As for the Misoyaki Butterfish, OH. MAH. GAWD!!!  The butterfish supplied an explosion of flavor where I literally closed my eyes during that first bite.  Phew, is it me or is it getting hot in here?

I thought it was pretty good. My wife had the pasta over meat sauce which was pretty good but she could only eat half of it. My son had the rib-eye steak and it looked ok but he enjoyed it and my mom had a turkey and guacamole sandwich which was good. The best part of going to this place is the desert and we had the snickers and the red velvet cheesecakes. They were pretty good but not great. The food overall was pretty good. 
The service was ok. It seemed like we had to wait a long time for our food and after we were done eating we had to wait a really long time for the server to come and get our desert order. 
We got there right at 5pm and didn't have to wait for a table. Otherwise, I don't think the food is worth a really long wait."}

It was a total fiasco! It took from 1130AM - 115PM for all to be served as the food was coming from the kitchen 2 plates at a time and a long wait time between each service. The hot food was cold. Everything fell on deaf ears of Adam the MGR. There were 2 servers for 40 people and we felt so bad for them. It was like abusive labor as they had to run in and out of the kitchen for the 2 hours and beside serving only 2 at a time they had to keep refills going. Why were there not more servers? Why didn't the manager help? It was a nightmare. I don't think any us will go back. If you like the looks of dog poo you will love the chopped liver.
On another note before I left I bought a LB of Salami. I could not believe what I was looking at when I got it home. There was so much white fat that the salami didn't even look red, it was white. Disgusting! 
The floors were filthy with papers and food. Someone told me that the owners never go to that Chompies and I am taking their cue and not going there either!"}

No, I've never been in Hawaii, and yes, I like fish, so how can I not be tempted.

True to the word about Hawaiian hospitality, I felt welcome and accommodated by the staff throughout the entire meal. Bonus point for our waiter too for her recommendation and also for knowing her stuff about the ingredients on our dish. For our entrees, I had my fish and my companion had duck, Hawaiian-Asian fusion it is. Three delectable portion of fish meat called Roy's Classic Trio (mahi mahi, salmon, and butterfish) tastefully decked with rich sauces adorned my long three hollow plate. It goes with flavored rice, and whew, I can't even describe how heavenly it satisfies my palate. My friend's well done duck breast, contrary to the chef's recommended medium cooked, is texturally juicy. Prepare to spend on the mid-range price but every bite is worth it.

There were two dinner functions when we were there so the noise level was kind-a up, other than that, I think it is a cozy place for a date night. Will ask for a booth on my next visit and will definitely come back."}

First off, when you go there and sit down, they give you a catalog style menu that's about 20 pages long mixed in with company advertisements.  Cheesecake Factory has a ton of food.  

I love their bread they bring out (of course not the best bread of all restaurants.. that goes to Firebirds).  Make sure to ask for more butter!

They give you huge glasses for the drinks so that's a plus.  Ok now onto the food.  I personally love the Cuban sandwhich and for an appetizer you cant go wrong with the artichoke.  Just delicious.

I go to CF maybe every four months.  It's not always on top of my list, but i"ll go if others want to.

I'm hoping tonight was just an "off" night.

The service was, as it always has been, excellent and friendly, but the food just didn't meet the expectations that we've set for this restaurant.  Their dishes are always flavorful with what seems like minimal ingredients.  Tonight everything tasted like it was depending too much on sauces and salt to carry the flavor.  I don't know if there was a different chef, or the ingredients were cheaper, or what, but it tasted more like a meal we'd get at The Keg or Keegans (and we like those places, but Roy's is much more expensive and had always been worth that extra expense).  We started with the calimari.  The waiter did tell us that they'd changed the recipe slightly since we'd been there.  It was fine, but the previous way it was served was MUCH better, and we told the waiter so.  I had the greens with strawberries and goat cheese and, I swear, I think they actually salted this!  Not that there was salt in the dressing, but actual salt on the greens.  My entree was the butterfish.  It was fine.  Not outstanding, not sublime, just fine.  I've never had a "just fine" experience here and didn't finish my meal (also a first!).  My husband had the filet and poached lobster.  He asked for the steak to be cooked medium well and it was easily rare to medium.  It all had a sauce on it that seemed heavier (and served with a heavier hand than usual), so mostly you tasted sauce and not the usual delicious simplicity of the food.  The good news is our dessert, the pineapple upside down cake, was as delicious as it's always been, so the evening wasn't a total loss! :)  

I really am curious if anyone else has noticed a difference or this really was an off night.  I'll be watching reviews to see if there's a downward trend.  I really hope not, this was always our favorite special night go-to restaurant."}

By The Rue

Thursday lunch was the Cheesecake Factory,
Ordered an iced tea but not a daquiri,
Chicken chipotle pasta was satisfactory,
The bread and butter were complimentary.

The hostess was hot like they always are,
She led us to a table that wasn't very far,
When I go golfing I shoot way over par,
You cannot pay your tab with an Iraqi Dinar.

My friend ordered some asian salad,
Crispy and fresh the taste was valid,
This review is reading like a rock ballad,
There aren't many words that rhymn with salad.

I would have given them 4 stars, just one thing,
Even the lunch menu thinks you have bling bling,
$11.95 for a bowl of pasta like I'm a king,
On the weekends you and your wife like to swing. 

The service was great, waitress was aware,
I look like a hobo, she avoided my stare,
I usually go commando, undies I don't wear,
This place was good, and the food was fair.

Mom always requests to go here when she visits, and last night we celebrated her Birthday with Tyler as our very cheerful and adept server. 

Any Roy's location captures the Aloha spirit and vibe with decor and cheerfulness of staff; we were guided to our booth adorned with orchids and including a Birthday card for Mom. Tyler introduced himself, wished Mom a Happy Birthday, and took our water order whilst we perused the menus. 

A creature of habit, I must have the Paradise Found cocktail, partially because I adore the ginormous copper 'pineapple' they serve it in. Similarly, I always have the lobster bisque, poured tableside over a generous amount of lobster meat and bit of heat offset by a light coconut note. Scott and Mom split and enjoyed the wedge salad. 

This time Mom and I both had my regular entree, the shellfish sampler, can't recommend it enough: a perfectly cooked lobster tail, seared scallops, and shrimp, accompanied by a lobster sauced rice. Scott had a filet which they always happily prepare blackened, subbing impossibly light mashed potatoes for the lobster mac, and we shared a side of mushrooms. All of our food was perfectly prepared, the timing of the dishes was on point, Tyler was engaging without being intrusive, and a Manager both checked in to wish Mom Happy Birthday and on us in general in spite of a large, raucous Duckhorn Wine Pairing meal being in process concurrently. 

The lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream is a must for any chocolate lover, both Scott and Mom ordered this, which you must do 15 minutes in advance, FYI. Tyler brought a very tasty mango sorbet gratis which I enjoyed with my Sambuca aperitif. 

Roy's is a great celebration spot, date night destination, has several private dining rooms, and catering menu options. Another not so spendy way to enjoy the beautiful bar area is through their nightly Aloha Hour option which offers drink, appetizer, and sushi specials. They have a patio outside with tiki torches which is probably great when it isn't so hot out. 

So, we are total fans!"}

She always makes sure I have what I ordered and makes sure to go through my order before I leave with it.  Joe is the server I had the last time I dined in the restaurant and he was wonderful.  I recently had to adopt a special diet and Joe really took the time to review what would work best for me.  After being a corporate trainer in the restaurant industry for several years I can honestly say both Kaitlin and Joe are great representatives of why this place is so good.  The food can only take you so far, but having a staff who does a great job and treats the customers well will bring people back for a long time to come."}

But the salmon was undercooked on our current visit, even though the server mentioned it would be medium with the fish cooked completely through. We specifically asked that nothing remained raw. After eating part of the fish, both salmon dishes turned out to be raw inside. The server apologized and had the kitchen cook the dishes again while we waited. They were fine this time, but the chef who we were told would come out to check never came. And the service was listless and slow, even though they were only about half full. We have had much better service here on our past visits. Given the upscale ambience and menu prices, the lackadaisical service was especially grating."}

I said Baja Burger. When the food came, it looked like chicken. I said, "I ordered a burger." The waitress replied, "It's a chicken burger." Being the reasonable person I am, I assumed I hadn't been paying attention (which has been known to happen) and wondered to myself why they'd put a 'chicken burger' in the burger section. I mean, I read the description - it said nothing about being chicken. Whatever, it looked good so I chalked it up to me not paying attention and let it go. The 'chicken burger' was delicious. So good. I was very pleased.

The service was pretty slow, especially after we got our food. The hostess cleared our plates and we waited patiently - for who knows how long - for our waitress to come back by. She finally dropped the check, at which point we waited a while longer - long enough for me to take a leisurely trip to the restroom - before she finally came back by to retrieve the check and run my card.

On the way to the restroom, I passed the kitchen where I saw the waitress either doing her sidework or checking out others' sidework. Either way, I had my answer as to why the service slowed to a crawl.

Oh, and on that check was printed, "Baja Chicken Sandwich." I checked the menu on my phone to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. I wasn't.

I said burger."}

Stop into The Cheesecake Factory for a variety of meal options -- even the cheesecake isn't easy to select with so many appetizing choices. The Cheesecake Factory's menu is so large that there's almost TOO many options for someone indecisive. I often find myself going to the Chandler location because of our usual waiter, Chris, who always does a phenomenal job by balancing multiple tables but still coming to check on mine while making good conversation.

Aside from the service being wonderful, I can't emphasize enough how much I love their Avocado Eggrolls. The Cheesecake Factory has two menus -- a regular menu and a skinnylicious (healthier) menu. The avocado eggrolls are found in the appetizer list on their regular menu. I highly recommend ordering those for the table (or yourself if you love them as much as me!) and their alcoholic mixed drinks are always unique and tasty no matter what you order. You really cant go wrong at The Cheesecake Factory! Oh, and of course.... try any of their cheesecakes for dessert.

My ONLY complaint is how cold they keep the restaurant. Today my boyfriend was freezing so he had to step outside a few times just to avoid shivering. I was also cold but used the napkin as a blanket more so than a napkin. Dress warmly if you intend on eating here."}

I've only had breakfast here, but I've had their bagels, cream cheese and a few pastries. Their bagels are top notch. Whenever my sister and mom visit from Tucson, we come to Chompie's and they stock up on dozens of bagels to last them until the next time they come up. 

Since we ordered before 11am on a weekday, I got my breakfast (2 eggs, bacon and two huge pancakes) for $3.99. I checked the receipt and asked the waitress if that price was right because I couldn't fathom all that for $3.99.

I can't really speak for some of the other reviews as far as wait times, etc, because yesterday when we went for breakfast (about 10:45) we had good service, and right as we were leaving (probably 11:30 or so) it had gotten SO busy, it was so crowded we could barely get out the door.

This revolutionary sit down restaurant is a place where anyone's appetite can be satisfied. Along with its 15 page menu and close to 100 cheesecakes, the cheesecake factory will have your mind spinning for at least 15 min before you even come close to a conclusion on what you want to eat. With everything from meatloaf to its completely vegetarian menu, the choices are wide but yet there is one meal that sticks out from the rest. If you're in the mood for a big, hearty, burger then you have stumbled upon the right part of the menu. In the specialty section of the menu are the burgers and none is as eye popping as the bold one named Ranch House Burger. This is a burger for the eater who actually wants a burger with everything. As you read the description you're sucked into the mouth drooling words that the menu seems to throw at you. The menu reads, "Pieces of Steak, Sautéed Mushrooms and Onions, Crisp Bacon and Cheddar Cheese on Top of Our Classic Burger served with French Fries or Green Salad." As soon as you end with the last word, you will immediately close the menu and finally stop dreading the 15 page of who knows what I want menu. This burger is simply hands down, no comparison, simply amazing.
 The burger should be brought out on a plate of its own as the fries struggle for a place on the edge of the plate as the Ranch House dominates most of the space. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of fries, so do not worry about the burger being all the meal. As you look at the Ranch House you try to figure your best entry strategy, but every angle of the burger looks so delicious its hard pinpoint exactly where to start. The cheese just drips off the sides like a volcano spilling its lava off the mountain. As you manhandle the burger and stuff your mouth with the first bite, your head rushes with joy like opening your Christmas presents. The bacon is crispy and the excellent sautéed mushrooms and onion are juicy; however, one thing is totally different about this burger as you chew it. You seem to experience something that you have with no other burger. The burger is also stuffed with pieces of Angus steak like those you cut off your juicy t-bone or filet mignon. 
The combination of all these miraculous toppings and pieces of steak will make your visit to the cheesecake factory, like no other place that serves burgers. So next time you visit the cheesecake factory or go for your first time, don't even look at the menu just tell your server you want the Ranch House Burger and I promise you won't be disappointed."}

To make up for our disappointment last time, management sent me a gift card.
Was immediately seated in a nice booth. Drink order taken by Chase, who turned out to be a great Waiter.
Cocktails were excellent.
Started with wedge salad, good, with crisp bacon.
Had the lanilanaulei (?) Roll. Wagyu beef, crab, asparagus. Delicious, melted in mouth!
I then had the always excellent Ribs. Didn't disappoint. 
We both had the Butterfish. Superb! Rich, luscious, and flaky. No fishiness at all.
Comes with black rice, not one of my favorites.
For dessert, wife had the decadent chocolate molten cake, I had the pineapple upside down.
Deelicious. Both with vanilla and coconut ice cream.
This was a pretty expensive dinner, and we agreed, worth it. Came away completely satisfied.
We'll be back soon, they have some excellent price fix specials.
Thanks to Chase and crew for the great service."}

This first visit left such a positive impression, i made it a point to visit this chain in several other cities over the years. I am not a huge fan of dining in chain restaurants, but i have made an exception in this case. The consistency and combination of high quality, freshness of food ingredients, very large menu selection and value for the money has made me a loyal fan. 

Since moving to the Phoenix metro area several years ago, i now visit the Chandler location almost exclusively. Although the Superstition Springs (Mesa) location is closer to home, my overall dining experience in Chandler has never been less than perfect. For me, it's been a sure thing!

The CKF is the type of place you can enjoy eating a meal alone, with friends or coworkers, with your spouse or significant other, or with family. Any day is a good reason to go. Why wait for a special occasion? Now that they offer curbside "To Go" service, you can pull up the menu online, phone in your order, drive over to the restaurant to the takeout parking spaces and call inside to let them know you are there waiting. The waitstaff delivers your food order to your car and accepts cash, debit, credit or CKF gift cards as payment. A perfect dining option for those times you are craving something from their menu but not in the mood to eat out. I have used this curbside service a few times on my way home from work when i didn't feel like cooking dinner.

The inside is spacious and nicely decorated. The outside patio has lots of elbow room and is a good option from late fall to early spring here in AZ. The menu is huge. Appetizers and drinks, healthy dining options, a main course meal or just dessert and a coffee beverage are some of the many choices available. The portion sizes are plenty large to share or take home leftovers for another meal.

I would have to guesstimate that over dozens of visits during the last several years, i have consumed 10's of thousands of calories. Do i regret that? Honestly, no. Each and every one of those calories has been well worth the enjoyment!

So many items to love. Some of my favorites include the Chicken Samosas, Roasted Pear and Bleu Cheese Flatbread, Chinese Chicken Salad, Factory Chopped Salad, Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta, Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken, Chicken Madeira, Peach Mint Julep, and the different Signature Lemonades, Of the cheesecakes my favorites are the Dutch Apple, the Salted Caramel, the White Chocolate Raspberry and the Lemon Meringue. My most favorite menu item is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp! It's a struggle with myself every time  go there to convince myself to order other things on the menu. 

i have never had less than perfect food, attentive, friendly and experienced wait staff, and an overall wonderful dining experience. Considering the food portions are quite large and the quality of the food is consistently fresh and delicious, the value is great"}

Last night was my friend's birthday and the staff was very kind and welcoming. A note was on the table when we got there and the night ended with a group picture, and a small cake. The staff here is amazing and would be the reason why I'd come here again, and have. I ordered the Dynamite lump crab crusted barramundi. The fist was done right, I enjoyed the taste and the sides of bok choy and the carrot. One thing I wanted to highlight was the sauce, while it was tasty, there was way to much of it, that it overpowered the taste of the fish. I would have loved it more if there was less sauce. 

Thanks again to everyone there our experience was amazing. Definitely will be back."}

We wanted to try this place out because we drive past it all the time. Well it went down hill from the beginning. The host acted surprised that we walked in. It wasn't busy at all and we stood there with her writing something on a paper for about 3 mins before she walked us to the table. The restaurant was small but nice. We sat at the table for about 5 mins before some girl who never introduced her self or welcomed us to Roys said "ice water or bottled."  We then sat there and other 5 min before a different male server dropped the water off. He did seem friendly either and walked away. We were so confused on who our server was. After sitting for a total of 15 mins before anyone came to take an order. There was about 5 other tables in the whole restaurant, not busy at all. Then finally the girl who took our water order came by and asked if we were ready to order (later found out her name was Nicole when we cashed out.) We asked if the meals were a la Carte because the menu was a bit confusing and she replied the meal comes with a veggie and a starch. When we ordered she didn't even mention what our meals came with. We ordered the calamari to start with. That was delicious. We were barley checked on. I know it was towards the end of the night but that doesn't count for poor service. Our meal came out about 20 min later. The meal was good but disappointing. The server did not know her menu. I only received a veggie and my boyfriend only received a starch when we were told we would receive both. They poured sauce all over my steak that was not mentioned on the menu which ruined the flavor of the steak. Would have been better if they put the sauce on the side. The food was good. I wouldn't say excellent, my boyfriend can grill better then what we had, but the service was awful. No one was friendly, or trying  to give us a WOW experience. When you go out to eat it's the atmosphere and the food that your paying for and it was the worst dining experience I have ever been too. The night was a loss and has put my boyfriend in a horrible mood that he wasted his money on that. We will never be returning or recommending this place to any family or friends. Spending ur money at McDonalds would have been a better night."}

It is a safe selection since there is something for everyone. Unless you hate food, there is bound to be something you like.  Except if you are my grandma, who was not pleased that the tongue listed on the menu was not available. 

But, really, out of all the burgers, omelets, smoked fish, salads and schnitzel on the menu, why would one want to order tongue in the first place? Just get pastrami!

She did order wine to drown her sorrow, which arrived in an impressively large and  filled to the rim wine glass. It was perhaps the largest serving of wine I have seen at a restaurant.  In my opinion, this totally outweighs the lack of beef tongue.  My impossible-to-please grandmother may disagree, but luckily she cannot remember how to operate the web browser on her computer to write Yelp reviews.

We usually go to the Tempe location but I was just as pleased with the Chandler location. Perhaps more pleased for the following two reasons:
1) In addition to the complimentary pickles, there was also complimentary bread. This may not be specific to location, it could just be a new implementation. Regardless, I like bread.  
2) In addition to the normal sampling of crumb cake at the bakery counter, there was also sampling of cookies.  FULL-SIZED COOKIES.  Nothing starts a meal better than a chocolate dipped, sprinkled covered, buttery cookie. Well played, Chompies, well played.

As always, they had a display case full of temptations: 7 layers of chocolate cake, cupcakes doubled in height by frosting, and cookies the size of Frisbees.

And, as if their menu was not big enough, they had added quite a few new options, such as a kale salad and flat-bread pizzas.  Everything was very tasty and as usual, my brother made it a personal challenge to eat as much food as possible (he managed 4 sliders and a plateful of onion rings). It was fascinating and horrified my grandmother, who just couldn't bring herself to look away."}

We eventually chose the oh so delicious Greek Chomp-a-dilla (Sauteed spinach, minced garlic, greek feta cheese, diced tomato, onions, scallions & a hint of Parmesan cheese) for an appetizer. Very fresh and the combo of flavors go well together. 

I had the Chicken in the Pot, holy mother... when they brought it out, it was so big that I actually sputtered, "How am I supposed to... eat it?" Another table had noticed just how giant my entree was and had to ask what in the world I ordered. This bowl of soup had 2 halves chickens, (not diced, not cubed, a chicken cut in half!), celery, carrots, jumbo matzo balls, kreplach, and noodles.

I'm not sure if there was a change in how they do things but we weren't served a plate of pickles like we used to upon being seated. I looked around the restaurant and didn't see any other tables with them either so maybe they stopped doing it, which is a bummer. Probably the most disappointing thing about the visit was the fact that I had ordered a Black & White cookie to go from the bakery counter and instead of putting the cookie in a plastic container they guy out it in a bag. Normally a cookie in a bag wouldn't be a big deal but by the time I went to eat the cookie later that evening about half of the chocolate on top was stuck to the inside of the bag and I was left with having to scrape it off which kind of ruined what was otherwise a delicious cookie. Oh well...guess we just won't make any special trips out that was just for Chompie's."}

My friend and I came here for the first time today. We were pretty impressed with their selection and pricing for Happy Hour. We liked mostly everything we had:(drinks $5- $7) Double Black Diamond, Flirtini, Passion Basil Mule. All the above drinks were flavorful, sweet and had the right amount of liquor..where you couldn't really taste it but know it's there. (Food $5- $7) Crispy Shrimp Tacos, Pretzels and cheese, Jalapeño Deviled Eggs. 
The only thing I didn't care for was the beef sliders. I felt that it was lacking flavor.
Our server was Samantha. She was great! Everything she recommended was good when we were unsure (I should've asked her about the sliders).
I would definitely come back. Even for the regular dinner menu. I do recommend coming to the restaurant before 530 for Happy Hour. I went on a Wednesday and it started  getting busy about 530pm."}

I think this is a kind of place that is great to go to once for the show, or maybe if you're taking someone that's never been before, but after that, I don't see any reason to pay the price they expect for the food.

It's a great show, and the food I had the other day was pretty damn great, but I wouldn't pay that amount again.

The service at this one was ok.  It took forever from when we palced our order to get the chef out there to start cooking (Yes I know he probably has to get his mise en place ready once he receives the order from the waitress), but we were waiting for quite a while.  Also, at the end of our meal, it took an equally long time just to get the bill.

One nice thing they do is if it's someone's birthday, they take a picture and print it out for you right there...so that's a kinda nice touch."}

No other place can satisfy me bc I am not a meat eater it sorta freaks me out.

That was probably the only downfall of our first time visiting since we chose this place for him to have the prime rib but it was a great experience our server Drake was great and I believe it was the manager that came to our table and told us about the prime rib that they usually keep a few pieces in case someone really wants the prime rib but he didn't get it bc of the temperature so he went for the delmonico since he loves rare steak. So for steak eaters it's a must try place (pricey so come for occasions) and there were some great seafood options for me but I figured I would try a steak and I was very satisfied.

It costs about 15 bucks with the substitution.  Generally, it would not be quite enough for my dinner, but they serve a delicious bread and butter for free.  The salad is very good as it is not just salmon plopped on lettuce; there are plenty of other ingredients - read the menu to see what the other ingredients are but i think cranberries, dried pecans, crumbled bleu cheese are a few.  Also, the salmon is a full piece, probably 8 ounces or so.  My fiance usually gets the Shrimp and strawberry salad with seared ahi instead of the shrimp - she loves it.  It is quite a decent sized piece of tuna, sliced thinly - about 5 times the amount that the nearby cheesecake factory serves in their ahi tuna salad.

Importantly, everytime I go here, the service is outstanding."}

This place has a great atmosphere and superb food all around. I tried the crab-cakes on the recommendation of another on yelp and have to admit they were very good.

The sauce for the crab-cakes was delicious and blended well with the crab and was delicately adorned with cabbage and veggies (very nice presentation).  I ordered the Grilled Mahi for the main course that which comes with a pineapple salsa and a side of your choice (my choice was the vegetables). This dish has small chunks of pineapple, served over a perfectly grilled filet that was moist and very flavorful. 
The vegetables were tasty and not under or overcooked (perfection). The service was great too, and our waiter Isaac, was fantastic, prompt and friendly. The manager also paid a visit to our table to ensure our meal and service was perfect (quality control).  My wife had the Ribeye steak and she said it was one of the best she's had. Our two friends also had the Ribeye steak and they also said it was fantastic. This was a great dinner experience with great friends at a great restaurant (3 Gs).

I've come here enough to have tried most of the Firebirds Specialties - Wood Grilled Salmon, Steak Au Poivre, Pecan Crusted Trout, and American Kobe Meatloaf. All were pretty good though I think I've had the meatloaf more times than any of the others. They have salads and burgers as well - something for everyone. I think we once hung out at the bar area where they had these huge jars of pineapple slices as well - so this place accomodates pretty well if your party wants to still hang out after the meal is done and plates are cleared off the table.

I asked if that was really reasonable, given the size of the waiting area and the unlikely happening of all 40 people showing up at the same exact time. The manager was so nasty - he flat out said he won't do it - he will NOT sit a table until at least ten people are here.... I said, 10? Before you were saying 40.... so is it 10 or is it 40? He finally agreed to seat us once 10 people arrived... thank god. Please note that it wasn't so much the message that was so awful - it was the nasty tone and the body language. Granted, what he was saying wasn't what was agreed upon during the two phone conversations and the one face-to-face meeting about the event - but the issue truly was in the delivery. He was down right nasty.

Moving on to when we finally got seated...Our server Ryan, was AMAZING. He was SO friendly, full of jokes and always smiling. From the moment we got seated, the experience completely changed from an F to an A.

Carlos and Kevin were our chefs... again, amazing!! Friendly, accommodating, great at what they do... telling jokes the entire time and engaging their audience. 


I am amazed that the three servers/chefs were able to turn this around and make it such an amazing experience. They took a completely ruined baby shower and turned it into the party it was supposed to be.

I love Benihana, just not this location.  If you feel up to the drive I would suggest skipping this one and heading north to the Scottsdale location.  If not there are a few local Teppanyaki places in Chandler that are just as good and cheaper."}

We called to make a reservation but were informed that they are booked up and we would have to wait to get seating.  

When we first got to the restaurant we found the wait was only 15 minutes long which was great. 

We got seated pretty quickly and were informed that a server would come to help us.  While seating we felt that the location wasn't really that busy  as there were 3 teppenyaki tables on our side that were empty. After waiting about 20 minutes at the table a server finally came to take our drink orders, we ordered two different lemonades.   Later he ordered our food items: colossal shrimp dinner menu with fried rice, Las Vegas roll, spicy hibachi chicken. 

After ordering you wait for a cook to come to the table, that was an additional 15 minute wait.  When the cook comes to the table he confirmed our orders and began cooking up everything in a grand presentation.  

So, my personal opinion is that they take a long time to get you seated drinks and food served.  I was starving so I may not have been that happy considering I had to wait not for the table but for everything else, however I give them a PASS since they stated that it would be a wait.  The food did not taste that great, and the side sauces they give to dip things had NO flavor.  The Las Vegas roll that we received I thought had no flavor either.  Maybe my taste buds were off but I definitely didn't think there was enough spice in anything that I ordered, and my food was supposed to be spicy! 

On a positive note - my kids would have loved this place.  They really take the time to create a performance while cooking and I am positive that my kids would enjoy :) 

Maybe next time I will request a LOT of heat on my stuff and then it will be different."}

I am a huge seafood lover / self-designated crab cake connoisseur and it has been TOUGH to find any remotely decent here in the middle of the desert. My husband has even (jokingly) banned me from ordering them because I am always disappointed.
Well folks, the end of my 6 year search has come to an end. Firebird's crab cake are the bee's knees, the cat's pajama's, the stuff that dreams are made of! It probably helps that they are a national chain and not an Arizona desert location only, but they are here and they are GOOOOOOD. 
In addition to said crab cakes we also might have had other food, I vaguely remember some bread, my husband had the Delmonico steak and my main course a Cesar salad. I opted to add shrimp (did I mention that I love seafood) and oh-my-god-I-could-not-even finish them, they were wayyyy too overly seasoned and insanely salty. I guess you can't win 'em all.
Another small bummer was that they do not have my fav wine by the glass (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc). Only by the bottle. I don't like Sauvignon Blancs from California grapes (tastes like dirt), so I had the Reisling instead. Still good, just not my first choice. 
There does always seem to be a significant wait for a table when we come in. So perhaps consider making a reservation? We were quoted 25 minutes at around 8 on a Friday evening, but were lucky enough to score a table in the bar which is open seating. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Overall, 4 stars - enjoyable ambiance, good food, good wine, and fantastic crab cakes!"}

We recently were here for boyfriend's birthday and found out they changed the $30 birthday deal.

Experience #1: 2 years ago, my wife and I booked a party of 9 for a weekday evening. We showed up and the rest of our group followed. 8 of us were present and after 15 minutes past our time, they refused to seat us because our 9th was not there. Seriously!? ONE PERSON? We left and went to cheesecake factory.

Experience #2: This past January, my wife and I felt like we would walk in and use her birthday coupon on a Wednesday evening. With our last experience 2 years behind us, we went in with a fresh slate. The place was very busy and there were a handful of people waiting in the lobby. I was told it was an hour and a half to two hours to wait for the two of us to be seated. I turned to my wife and she said we'll pass, and once I turned back to the hostess and began to spoke, the girl turned around and walked away from me. What?! How rude!

So we make a reservation knowing its a busy place, and won't be seated (estimating: $25-30 a plate = nearly $300 of business) and just the two of us show up and we may not be seated for 2 hours? Like a previous review mentioned, they care more about overbooking reservations and leave no wiggle room for walk ins. Who in their right mind would go somewhere to eat and be told, you won't be eating for 2 hours! Absurd. The only way I'll give this place a third chance is if it's free, or someone else invites me to join them."}

I still rate this 5 stars.  They are still a bit pricey, the menu is basically the same as before, and the service is really good.

We come here every few months.  Usually on an occasion as this is a bit more appropriate than Outback or Chipotle for an occasion.  Today was no exception.  We received an email coupon for a "free side salad" (with entree purchase), which was a nice bonus.  My wife wanted the salad, so I ordered the kobe meatloaf.  She ordered some soup because we expected a relatively petite salad.

Well, we were wrong.  The salad was huge.  Filled up my wife so that she barely touched her tortilla soup (though she did try it and said it was very good).  The salad she chose was the spinach, and she loved it.

The Kobe meatloaf (with mushroom sauce) was OK.  Not as spectacular as I was hoping.  But it was good.  The mashed potatoes were good (as usual), and the beans had a nice flavor (not the tart flavor the beans of so many places have).  It wasn't a bad choice, but I doubt I would choose it again.  It just wasn't "special" in any way.  Not of the same caliber as the Aspen sirloin or the steak au poivre, even though the price was almost the same.

Still no wheat bread...but that's not enough to take away a star."}

I would crave a steak though (once in a long while) and where would I venture to? Firebirds, of course! I've been here countless times and the service I receive is always top-notch. Servers are always knowledgeable about the menu. The ambiance is a bit more on the intimate side: lighting is definitely low. We usually order bottles of wine when we come here. My dad usually takes care of that though, but always ask your server! They are quite knowledgeable about their wines, as well. 
So okay I had one mishap here once. We had a man serving us and I can't recall his name (this was post-veg) but I remember him being so sarcastic and rude about me ordering my steak not medium or even less cooked. Sorry, I'm eating it. I'm also paying for it. So if you have a problem with that, you obviously have way too much time on your hands and need to invest it into something else besides trying to facilitate what I am consuming. 

Anyways, besides that, generally everything goes well here and I never saw that server again so maybe he isn't around anymore. :)

I surprised my wife and brought her here for our one year wedding anniversary. She had never been. I made a reservation at 7:00 and was not sat until after 7:00, strike one. We browse through the menu and we decide on our dishes. My wife ordered the teriyaki chicken and I ordered the Rocky's choice (chicken and steak) there were two other parties sat with us (I know this is normal and I'm not upset about this) both gentleman that were also at the table both ordered the Rocky's choice as well. As the chef was cooking, he cooked two and a half chicken breasts for the 4 meals that included chicken. I'm thinking to myself that hopefully he is going to put more on the grill. He portioned out one whole chicken breast for my wife's dish which I was pleased about because it was her first time and she was really enjoying everything. He then proceeded to cube up the remaining one and a half chicken breasts for the remaining THREE chicken dishes. Strike two. I paid for a whole portion of chicken and received about a third of a chicken breast. I am highly disappointed in this restaurant and will not be returning. I did not complain as it was my anniversary and did not want an issue, but looking back I should have mentioned it because the dishes cost way too much to be served like I was. This was supposed to be a special night for my wife and I and there was nothing special about taking her to Benihana."}

When greeted with staff, you notice that they are wearing special outfits that appear to be from Japanese culture with symbols on them. This small addition adds a touch of sophistication to the restaurant, making you feel as if you're getting the full cultural experience.

At a good restaurant, there should be background music playing just loud enough to be noticed, but not loud enough to the point you have to raise your voice to speak to your friends and family.  At Benihana, there was no music playing at all. Whether that means the music was too soft of there was none at all, I would have liked more music to be playing as I was enjoying my food. 

At a restaurant with good service, I expect a server who is respectful, attentive, asks how the quality of food is, and does things in a timely manner. During my experience at Benihana, the waitress was pretty attentive, coming by a decent amount of times, but when it came to quickness and accuracy of what was needed, the service was not up to par. For example, my friend asked for lemons for her water, and only after she asked three times did she receive them. While taking our food order, the waitress wasn't able to understand exactly what we wanted, and when she offered her opinion, was rude about it.

The chef was pretty cool... He also was very involved with the whole table, asking everyone what they needed and catering to what they asked. What made his service above average was that he got personal with us, getting involved in our casual conversations and giving his interesting input on whatever we were talking about. At other restaurants, they chefs can be tired, not wanting to do the usual tricks or lazy, and not interacting with the customers. This aspect of Benihana was definitely above average compared to most other teppan-style places.

Compared to other restaurants with the same style, overall Benihana is an okay restaurant that has some good qualities that make for a good dining experience. Although they need to work on some things such as music, parking, and service, I would suggest Benihana to families and couples looking for more casual yet interesting dining experience."}

I had my wife's surprise 40th birthday here ,I had one of my wife's friends flown in and we had her dress as a server for the big Surprise.  the staff went above and beyond to make sure it happen as planned, from turning her into a server, hiding  her in the back until all our party had arrived.

Make sure you upgrade to the chicken fried rice its well worth the $3 extra. Every month they have a different special for two and its usually a good deal. This last time we went it was the chicken and steak for two and it was tasty. Make sure to ask for garlic butter on your entree if you like garlic because in my book it makes everything taste better.

Where do I begin with this place.  I took a young girl who turned 13 here yesterday for her birthday dinner.  She had a great time last night.  She ordered the Trio which was chicken, shrimp and steak.  The meal came with fried rice, soup, onions, squash and shrimp.  The food was really good.  The chef did a great job and made it exciting for her too.  The server did get a little stretched thought a couple of times.  It was okay.

This time we showed up for Restaurant Week.  It was a decent deal.  Hard to know if the portions were a little smaller, but the filet medallions with bleu cheese sauce on the menu is almost as much as the RW price was.  So can't really complain there.

I actually ordered the "flat iron steak" (which is a particular cut of sirloin).  I thought the portion a bit small, but not horrible.  The garlic mashed potatoes were a generous portion.  But I didn't taste the garlic like I expected.  Their signature Fired-Up sauce was too heavy for the sirloin.  Very strong flavor totally overpowered the meat.  It might have been more appropriate for a rack of ribs or something similar.  The meat was served in a puddle of that sauce.  I found a quick tap on my plate seemed to remove most of the sauce, and the little bit that was left was not too overpowering.  But they really should have used an au poivre sauce (or maybe a red wine sauce).  Would have been a better match.

The key lime pie was REALLY good.  Too much whipped cream, but that's easily removed.  Really good.

I wish I could go 5 stars, but I can't.  The sauce selection for my entree just did not work, and the garlic mashed tasted more like a cheesy mashed to me.  Not a lot of garlic (I really didn't taste any).  But I can go with 4 stars for now.  I'm sure we'll return at some point (we seem to come here a few times per year) and I will update my review again."}

Four of us were meeting for dinner at 6 pm.  I wanted their new Tempura basket (just got their e-mail advertising it) - not a chef's table needed item.  So I made reservations on-line and said I didn't need the Chef Table, figured why tie up 4 seats at a Chef's table.

I get there @ 5:50 to be told they don't take reservations for non chef tables which are actually in the lounge.  I go in there to see 3 regular tables...2 taken and another "reserved" how is that so?  The hostess says we can have the center table a large high stool pub table.  REALLY?  With a seven year old?  Let alone who wants to have a nice quiet meal in the "bar" with your feet dangling?   

Walked out and had a nice meal at Chili's next door!  From now on going to Scottsdale Benihana where they have a nice non-lounge and non-chef table area for people to have a quiet dinner...that's what I expected at Chandler.  

Also, they told me they tried to reach me.  No phone call, text or e-mail all day.  Come home to find they canceled my reservation at 5:53 (what while I was standing there?)
CRAPPY customer service!"}

I didn't realize it was a chain until after I'd made reservations. This would usually be a nonstarter for locavores like us, but the prix-fixe menu looked appealing and it was close to home for a weeknight dinner, so we stuck with the plan.

The place is BIG. Claim Jumper big, but not obscene like Cheesecake Factory. This was a bit of a put-off, but the dim lighting and well-spaced seating made it feel a bit more intimate. The smell of wood smoke in the entryway was delightful and did a good job communicating what Firebirds is all about. Both the hostess and waiter were polite and knowledgeable. Service was attentive but not rushed on what appeared to be a slow weeknight; we spent an hour or so enjoying our dinner rather than feeling like a "turn."

The Restaurant Week menu was a great bargain at 30 bucks a head for an app, entree and dessert. Learning that wine by the bottle was half price that night was just a cherry on top. They started us out with a nice bit of crusty fresh baked bread.

For apps, the boss had a crab cake and I ordered Firebirds' signature BLT salad. The crab cake was well seasoned, if a bit mushy in the center. The accompanying coleslaw was a split decision--I liked it, but she didn't enjoy the tortilla strips that were meant to add crunch. Honestly, the crisp purple cabbage provided plenty of texture. I'm not usually a salad guy, but the BLT was fantastic. The finely-diced tomatoes and abundant large bits of crisp thick-cut bacon appeared in every bite and it was tossed with just the right amount of creamy garlic dressing.

Our entrees were nicely prepared, which is a tall order when one of them is a pork tenderloin--a cut that's not naturally flavorful and very easy to dry out. Mine was done to a perfect medium (as promised by our waiter) with a moist, barely pink center despite a great char from the grill. Another half teaspoon of the glaze and it would've been perfect. The wife's sea bass was cooked and seasoned well, but the thickness of the fillet was inconsistent, resulting in slightly overcooked edges. The potato sides (chile cheddar mash for me and a potato pancake for her) were both excellent but overabundant. We sure would've loved some fresh veg instead of all those carbs (and plenty of butter, no doubt).

Our desserts were nothing to write home about. The flute of mixed fresh berries and cream was light and refreshing, but nothing more than you'd expect. The chocolate brownie a la mode was a bit dense and lacked the chocolate punch and fudgy texture I look for in a good brownie; it certainly didn't give the impression that it was baked in house.

With the exception of the potato sides mentioned above, portion sizes were appropriate--satisfying but not excessive. The prices listed on the regular menu for the items we ordered were pushing the limits of what I'd consider fair; they certainly wouldn't be what I'd consider a bargain.

Overall, we were impressed. This three-star review is in part a reflection of my personal preference for small, locally-owned restaurants with executive chefs you know by name. Compared head-to-head against its true peers (upper-echelon national chains), it's deserving of four stars and will be one of our go-to places when we need a safe choice for a nice dinner with a mixed group of friends or family."}

The food is just basic American: steaks, chops, and fish with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans.  But they do it well.  I think they make a pretty good steak but I love their salads for lunch or when I am in the mood for a lighter dinner.  Oh, and they have some decent burgers, too.  Wine list has some well priced bottles on there and they also have a list of specialty cocktails but they are sorely lacking in beer options.

Unfortunately, due to its proximity to the mall, the dining area can sometimes have a few overtired kids but if you arrive later or sit in the bar area it is possible to have a romantic evening.   They keep the lighting low and the music subtle.  The decor is a bit corporate but has its own middle America charm to it and adds the right amount of flare without being too over the top.  A solid 3 1/2 stars."}

We were seated at the bar area tables and had to wait awhile to even be greeted by our server. After deciding what we wanted from the menu (two sushi rolls and entrees) our sushi came first. We tasted it and it was a tad dry so I figured id ask for some eel sauce. Our server was nowhere to be found for a good 10 mins. So i got up and asked for sauce from the sushi chef. Fine. After we finished our rolls, finally, about 15 mins later our salad and soup came out. Im not skilled with chopsticks and it took another 5 mins for our waiter to be spotted and more than 5 mins for forks. Plates werent cleared from our small table either. About 15 mins after we were done with soup ond salad our fried rice and shrimp came. By that time i was just ready to get out of there. I was annoyed. The food was good but didnt enjoy it because the service was so bad. After we ate i asked for the check and had to flag him down again to give him the card. I think they need to hire more servers. Service seems to be the biggest issue here. Very upset."}

The chef we had wasn't very entertaining, he didn't do the egg trick, and his onion volcano was lacking any resemblance to a volcano. Maybe I was just expecting too much. Having been to a couple teppanyaki places before and loved the whole experience.

NEVER again will I ever go here or any other Benihana location.  and to top it all off, our waiter was rude, careless, and seemed like he didn't know what he was doing.

Ultimately, it allows you to really get into how this restaurant works, but it kind of backfires:  I know enough to cook Japanese-style now for about 1/10th the price.   

The layout here is kind of weird.  Forget anything intimate--I was kind of fearing the placement of our largely dysfunctional get together near the rather normal couple, but it worked out well enough.   Problems arise in the layout of the place--everybody faces out a window with the majority having their backs to the entrances (I hate that).  The "view" is a massive parking lot bookended by a La-Z-Boy store and a Chili's.  Switching the layout of the place might have been a small salvation.  

What you're really getting is the cooking show, worthy of a sixth star:  our chef was extremely friendly and we had a great time as our food was cooked.  

But it's not a grand luxury, it's just Eastern efficiency.  You don't wait for your food, they don't have to hire expos, and they need less kitchen infrastructure.  As soon as the food is done, it's on your plate--the tradeoff of the show as I would have liked to have it all out at the same time.   Something is slightly taken away from it when the other chef on the other table does the train sound again with his butcher knife; It feels like a pre-programmed repertoire to go with the pre-programmed food.  This is why chains leave me bitter, even good ones like Benihana.   

The ingredients are nothing special--for a table of 7 they bust out a few zucchinis, a couple handfuls of generic white mushrooms, a couple white onions, small slabs of steak and chicken, etc.  What really gives this place its Denny's-plus quality was immediately apparent in the side salad--a bag of store bought mix and a couple tomatoes.  It appears to add up to a lot of food, but I've spent less at other restaurants and usually bring home a box.  

The sauces they use are what saves the place food wise, but they're all clearly pre-made elsewhere for a generic nationwide palette--the hot mustard just wasn't hot, at all.  On the other hand, the two ginger sauces, a red one in the meat and a yellow one in the salad were absolutely delicious.

Unfortunately, this place severely loses on price and service.  The server was basically gone the whole time.  Fuck her.  She splits her tip with the awesome chef and drags his performance down.  

At one point I got up and went back to the front end to ask for the bathroom, waiting impatiently for the hostess to finish chatting with a friend who came in with another table.  What the hell?  The bathroom itself was a sticky-floored mess--something I would expect at Veterans Memorial Coliseum or some douchebag bar, not a place that charges this much for dinner.  Drinks were extremely expensive, charging $9 for a 22-oz bottle of beer.   

The magic here is the presentation, the sauce, and the overall delivery, but it's severely hampered by food quality, prices, and poor service.  It would have been two stars, but I couldn't be angry at the place after having such wonderful ice cream and a picture (scantly offered as it were) at the end.  

Overall, Benihana is worth the one-time experience but needs significant improvement to happily lure me back as a repeat customer."}

I took my new girlfriend there for the first time last night 4/20/17 while saying that it is a great place. I love the fresh lemonade in a sugar rimmed glass and the Pepper encrusted steak.

We had a 10 minute wait to be seated, which wasn't normal for the time on a Thursday but neither of us minded at all. Once seated we were greeted by our server who was training another server (she was awesome for being in training). I ordered the lemonade and my date was not given much time to look over the menu before being asked if we just wanted waters to start. I had not even had a moment to look at the drink menu which had been with our server. I was looking for the Double Black Diamond Martini which I didn't see on the table cards or food menus which we were already given. I thought it was strange we didn't see a drink menu until after we had ordered our waters/lemonade. Also, we never received straws for our drinks throughout our stay.

I ordered a Double Black Diamond Martini and asked for Bread. I had finished the lemonade and moved the glass to the far end of the table, expecting to sometime soon get a refill offer or the Martini I ordered or the bread I asked for!?!. I do not know exactly how much time had passed but I was irritated, looking around and trying to make contact with our server. My date asked if I just wanted to leave but I did not want to accept poor service and leave to find another place to eat. Finally I got up and asked the trainee if I could get the drink and bread I ordered. While I was up I went to the restroom if nothing more to give the server additional time. When I came back my lemonade was not refilled nor did my date say that it was offered but I did have my Martini waiting.

Bread came shortly before the meal arrived and I was offered a refill on my lemonade and if I would like another Martini (I had finished it already) which I declined. Once the meal arrived my date asked for her own strawberry lemonade, both of them came back about the same time. 

I was only able to eat about half of my steak before I asked to have it boxed up due to having a headache and not feeling well. I would have written something last night but I only wanted to get to bed and sleep off how I was feeling.

Overall I think I was very disappointed with this visit and it has left a bad vibe for me and my date who was there for the first time."}

The waitress repeatedly sighed when we asked for refills. Plates were never even taken away. They brought the ice cream even and just set it in front of the dirty plates. I had to rush removing plates from in front of the birthday girl WHILE they were singing because they just shoved it at the top portion. Our waitress only started removing dishes after she saw I started taking pictures. You can see the piles of plates we started to stack on our own at the top right and my green tea ice cream set in front of my dishes as well as the multiple drink glasses because the few times we did get refills she just brought us more glasses but never took the old ones away. We spoke to the female manager who said she would take care of it and gave us two cards for chicken rice upgrades on our next trip with the purchase of meals. The male manager upon arrival who refused to take our electronic birthday card w free mug for my two daughters (both April) because we didn't bring it printed out which I have never had to do. We have gone to Benihana at least 6x annually and this is by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered. So very disappointing.

When I asked if the wings were breaded, the waitress said she'd check and also bring me a gluten free menu which was astute of her. I do wish that they'd consider a separate fryer for non-breaded items so they could put more items on their gluten free menu, but overall it was fine. I ended up with a tenderloin and a baked potato.

Our server was Abdullah, very pleasant.
Started with the Arnold Palmers to drink. It was so sweet we had to ask for water to dilute it. Our waiter was very accommodating with that.
Appetizer wings were just average. The dipping sauce tasted like a ranch/ blue cheese mix & was extremely salty! 
My daughter ordered the Durango Burger, beautiful presentation & over all a good burger. It was a fair size that she couldn't finish. However, pretty pricey at $13.50
I had the Peppercorn Steak. $ $23.95. I was somewhat surprised that it came "pre sliced" in strips not as a whole steak?! The Peppercorn Sauce was ok needed a bit more salt & more of the sauce on the plate. I had to ask for a side of steak sauce. You'll have the option of a side excluding soup or salad, that is an addition cost. My first thought; was to go with the Parmesan Mashed Potatoes but asked the server about the Au Gratin & which he preferred. So, Au Gratin it was! Disappointed they were overcooked. It's offered up in a small ceramic dish separate from the steak. All the cheese had melted off & just the over broiled bubble residue coated the sides. It was oily & lacked in flavor.
I will say the customer server was good. We were visited by the manger who came over & greeted us and was engaging. Our server was professional, but the overall experience wasn't impressive for the experience & price."}

My shrimp was not my fav because it was smothered in warm thousand island mayo.  By 5:300ish, the house was packed, patio filled up, it is definitely a popular joint!  I give very high marks to the waitresses who attended to our table, they are outstanding, personable and we couldn't have asked for better service!  Food is in my view very average 2.5 to 3.0.  Beverages were very tasty.  Atmosphere is very inviting, comfortable, a very nice hang out at the end of the day, say... Friday, TGIF!  I can't review their dinner menu at this point but l hope it is better than their happy hour menu."}

First the food and service. I ordered the hibachi Filet that came with the five courses. The soup, salad, rice, veggies, and meat. Oh, and a small amount of shrimp for an appetizer. 

Now maybe I'm spoiled because I'm used to Kobe's steakhouse when I lived in FL and NY. I have yet to find another Kobe style steakhouse that's good on its own let alone as good as an actual Kobe's 

This place is no exception. The soup was good.  The salad was not. The dressing had to much of a ginger taste. Obviously subjective. You might like it. The rice was very overlooked and bland. Same with the veggies and the shrimp. My wife said the same thing. It just had no taste at all. 

The Filet was a different story. It was excellent. I don't know how the cook went from making everything tasteless to making the Filet perfect but he did. 

Speaking of the cook on to the service. Is was very good. Our experience was a bit long (two hours) but they were busy so that's to be expected. They were professional and courteous. The cook did his part to be "funny". He wasn't bad. 

Having said all of that I'll never go back. One, the bill for everything was $100 and like I said 90% of the food was tasteless. Our drinks were good. I'll give them that. 

The other reason is their posted signs. One you see outside basically says they do checks on everyone they hire and the won't hire illegals. Only Americans and immigrants here with a work Visa. You know, the proper way to do it. Not sneak in and stick your hand out for free stuff and demand rights. 

That sign was excellent. The anti gun sign was not. And that's why I'll never go back. I'm not going to bring my family into a victim zone. Criminals simply do not play by the rules. I'm baffled that anti gunners actually believe signs and gun control laws work. They don't. Criminals don't care about signs and laws. 

And the only other reason not to allo guns is to not "offend" the anti's. I'm sorry but who cares about the feelings of people who are so naive they are basically children in grown up bodies. It's time to stop placating the children who's gun knowledge comes from Hollywood and agenda driven politicians and anti gun groups funded by Soros and Bloomberg. 

The restaurants that post these signs should be held accountable if a criminal comes in with a guns and hurts people. It's not like this already doesn't occur. Restaurants have to follow rules and codes so people who visit don't get hurt. Bad food. Poor construction. Basically a restaurant can't fall into disrepair and hurt someone. So how is it different if the owners willing create a place where patrons have no defense against a bad person with a weapon?  

It's time to stop supporting places that do this. It's time to punish restaurants who cater to criminals and naive "grown ups"."}

The mashed potatoes were probably our favorite parts of the meals.  The rest, we agreed, was all pretty bland.  The service was okay, not terrific.  We ate several other meals in town that were much more flavorful."}

It's a little cheaper than in used to, as I usually only go to higher end steakhouses. It definitely has the wood fired feel, with brick/wood interior and a nice patio to the side. The servers are above average. They were a little slow when I visited, but nothing too terrible.

They start with cornmeal bread and soft butter. The butter melts onto the bread, and is so soft. I could eat four to five of these loaves and be one happy man.

Appetizer - lobster queso with homemade tortilla chips. Even though I'm not usually a fan of combining cheese and seafood, this was quite good. It also had a nice kick to it. The lobster was fairly fresh and cooked well.

Salad - wedge salad with bacon. Definitely a solid salad in my book. Nothing mind blowing, but solid quality.

Steak - 9 ounce bacon wrapped filet with a salted baked potato. For a more moderate steakhouse, it was really good. Sure, it's no Durant's, Ruth Chris, etc, but it was quite good for the price point. The steak was very tender and salted appropriately.

For a casual meal, this place is a reliable option."}

For a table of 8 with 5 November birthdays, this would be a place NOT to come back to. The "enticing" $30 birthday certificate allows you the $30 off their teppan specialties with a purchase of a full price teppan dish Monday through Thursday. 

Cocktail: Benihana Plum Wine - from Berkeley (me thinks) $7.50 for the glass. This is a regular plum wine. 

Specialties: 
6 course meals comes with: Onion and mushroom soup, salad, sauteed shrimp, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. Served with their mustard sauce and ginger sauce. Steamed rice. Hot green tea. ice cream or sorbet. 

My pick: Deluxe Treat $38.
- Filet mignon (medium rare) and a cooked lobster tail with garlic butter and lemon. This is a normal surf and turf meal cooked before your eyes. 

The teppan chef first started with cleaning the teppan top. Oil, then made the beating heart fried rice (which is an optional for an additional $5). Next up is cooking the zucchini, mushrooms and making the onion volcano and choo-choo train. Then was the chicken, steak, filet mignon and lobster tails. 

Menu books changed from the nicely bounded one to the economical thin and easily replaceable, cleanable menu books. 

Overall: 0-star rating
Minus a star: Server failed to provide the hot green tea. 
Minus a star: Server forgot about the ice cream. 
Minus a star: Server didn't take, nor offer the birthday pictures
Minus a star: Server never refilled waters
Minus a star: Server messed up the checks

I doubt the birthday recipients enjoyed the birthday experience. Better dine on a non-birthday."}

We have had some good experiences here, but the service has become unbearable. The last four of five times we have dined in at the restaurant we have had huge problems with service and always left really irritated. Ironically this was a restaurant that we used to have really good experiences at when we dined in, but the takeout was nothing but problems. Recently we have done much better with takeout, but now we really don't ever want to dine in at the restaurant anymore. I certainly don't expect any restaurant to be consistently perfect, but after four or five times in a row of being virtually ignored, and other problems, while dining at the restaurant, I think it's safe to say it's more than just an occasional problem, or just bad luck.

On this visit we went to the restaurant early on a Saturday, hoping to avoid a crowd, and hopefully get better service. Clearly crowds are not the problem. There must have been more employees milling about than there were customers. It started just like other visits, where it seemed like we were invisible. Adding insult to injury, we were seated on the left side of the restaurant where there were only a total of three tables occupied, and two waitresses waiting on them. Yet, still no one would come to our table and wait on us. Just as I was about to get up and ask someone why we were not being waited on, a waitress finally showed up. However, it was not one of the two waitresses working the tables around us. It turned out it was a waitress who was working tables all of the way on the other side of the restaurant, and working more tables than the two waitresses combined on our side. We were the only table she was waiting on that wasn't all the way on the other side of the restaurant. Why would they do this? The restaurant was less than a quarter full, if that.

Sure enough, she took our order, and we began a long wait before getting our food. When we finally got our food, my son's salad was covered in Caesar dressing instead of the ranch he requested. He does not like Caesar dressing. This wouldn't be so bad, but once again we could not get someone to come to the table so that he could get it fixed. We waited what seemed like forever. My son staring at his food, me eating mine, and both of us with nothing to drink.

Eventually I lost patience and asked one of the many employees just milling about the restaurant if I could see the manager. The woman that I asked was walking up and down the aisle the whole time we were in the restaurant doing nothing but entering information in a tablet. Other employees milling about occasionally stopped and chatted in groups, but no waitress for us. Eventually my son got his new salad and we got our drinks, but we were there a LONG time. I was long done eating but had to watch as my son eat as he was just getting his food.

This restaurant is managed very poorly. I think most of the patrons could step in and do a better job without any experience. At the very least they could figure out that it's a bad idea to have a waitress come from the other side of the restaurant to help two waitresses who have less tables combined than the one who served us from afar."}

The staff is always great and a manager almost always comes around to make sure we are satisfied.  I've tried quite a bit of their menu however I generally go back to the burgers which I think are so tasty.  

I go for the Durango burger since they took their amazing Pablano burger off the menu (complain about that if you go!  bring it back Firebird's).  The potato skins go great as an appetizer.

My other go to is a BLT salad with grilled chicken (get the raspberry chipotle dressing with this and win at life).

Only once did my food come out sub par.  I ordered a rib-eye and it ended up being very tough and unsatisfying.  A manager took care of me with a new steak and a fresh baked potato.  Problem solved!"}

On entering (early evening), we were greeted with a lovely smoky smell that tantalized.  Seating was immediate by a friendly hostess.

The restaurant has a relatively dark interior similar to many other steak houses.  I could hear the music, but it sounded like it was coming from another room.  They could have piped it in to the main room quietly so that it didn't have the distant echoy effect.

My dining companion ordered a strawberry lemonade that was served in a pint glass with a sugared rim.  There were slices of fruit inside and froth on top - evidence of its fresh taste.  I, as usual, ordered coffee and that was much more bitter than I like.  Dark roasts that have been left to heat too long always taste the same, and it isn't good.

Since so many people liked the crab cakes, we ordered those for an appetizer.  To my mind, they had too much of a strong celery taste.  The spicy marmalade sauce that they came with complemented the crab cakes excellently.  The slaw had crispy tortilla strips in it and a nice light dressing - very tasty.

Our ceasar salads arrived.  The usual romaine lettuce was well dressed and augmented by in-house made croutons (the bread also being baked in-house) and nice slices of parmesan cheese.  Unfortunately, the parmesan was the only salt component, so the salad was fairly flat.

I ordered the Durango burger - a chile spiced affair with pepper jack cheese, fried onions and roasted garlic ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, despite the tantalizing smell when we entered the restaurant, there was no smokiness on the burger.  Nor was there any spice.  They grind the meat in-house, so the medium rare burger had a good texture ans taste to it.  However I wanted punch, and got none.

My dining companion ordered the smoke house burger with bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon and grated cheddar cheese.  There was too much bbq sauce included, and the cheddar cheese was not melted.  The bacon was the highlight here.  He also had fries (whereas I opted to replace the fries with my salad).  The portion size on the fries could only be described as small, and the fries were left behind as unappetizing.

Overall, an average place.  It's certainly a place I will go to again, but I'm likely to try other offerings in the area before I choose to go back."}

Probably because I was.  Anyway, I am a huge fan of teppanyaki and have been to several other places around the valley who do it quite well.  I mean how can you not love flaming onion volcanoes, shrimp acrobatics and other food awesomeness?  It's like a circ du solei of food!  Yet I didn't listen to almost everyone I know or 2/3rds of the Yelp reviews saying this place isn't all that wonderful.  Ok, ok - one point Yelp and my friends; zero points Jason.  Benihana isn't in fact all that great.

Benihana is however good at making a teppanyaki place that runs like a well oiled machine or at least a ride at Disney Land.  They shuffle you in, wait until your table is full, put on a little show, charge you way too much then shuffle you out the door to make room for the next group.

Aside from the food being waaaaay overpriced, the service is excellent and meals tasty.  The "show" isn't bad either.  Except now they aren't allowed to do any of the cool stuff because people were apparently getting hurt from flying shrimp and flaming onion volcanoes.  And Benihana being a corporate chain behemoth decided they better do away with the "dangerous" stuff.  Bummer!

In my option the food and service is on par with just about any other teppanyaki place around.  So, if you have a hankering for the stuff you are probably better off going to Ichi Bahn or some other place that may be cheaper, not feel like a Disney ride, and do cooler food tricks n' stuff.  But, if you must go, sign up for Benihana's birthday club thing because they will give you a $30 gift certificate which is pretty solid and the reason why I went."}

I am far to tired to get into it, but OH MY GAWD oddly enough the food has much less "crud" on it, basic steak salt pepper YUMMY, I used to feel guilty saying I need less salt etc... soy on the steak blah, and tonight yippy, but our server was on drugs or just plain and simply put an idiot, I nearly left twice, I  decided to stay had fun, chatting and taking pics. my sushi was made wrong, I ordered first, so it came last and it was wrong, which makes me want to say forget it, but they bring it, and it's wrong again, I say this isn't what I ordered and blonde person claiming to be a server says no they changed the menu, bam she is gone. I ask for paper napkins, bam I never see her, other servers walk by over and over ignoring me and my Voice CARRY"S! I have sushi after the chef arrived, They came with the Birthday  stuff, but for this kid at the table next to us, I had my birthday certificate open on the table the entire time, she says" I asked if anyone was celbrating" OH MY GAWD I then get a 45 dollar bill that says 78  ... she stands there arguing with me, I called Manager , he fixed it, and didn't fight,   I also usually bring cash , but last I was there they put a manditory 18 percent tip. and I was giving the waiter cash, and the chef cash, and then bam i notice the 18 percent gratuity , I can't say give me back the tip, so I tell manager, and he took it off. GRRRR so I figured it was a manditory tip, well it isn't anymore, so I tipped 15.00 cuz I enjoyed the chef, and I suppose someone else will get part of it, but I am exhausted getting bad service, I am not too thrilled the food was good, because what is the point if you have to fight for a napkin, the right food, and of course a lousy candle in some ice cream, (My 11 year old was disappointed on me. ya know) I worked for tips my entire life, and let me tell you, I have been known to tip like mad for great service, imagine if I tipped 15 for this LOUSY SERVICE~ We might be back next year for something, but I won't miss them if I don't go.

Last night's visit was just as spectacular as the first one.  The food was impeccable, service outstanding, and comfortable just doesn't seem to fit properly to describe the venue.

I had the beef kabobs, medium, which came perfectly grilled and removed from the skewer.  The grilled vegetables had just the right amount of scar on them.  Outstandingly sweet tomato chunks and other fresh vegetables on the second skewer.  The green chile mac and cheese was perfect, just the right amount of heat in an oh so creamy cheese sauce.  My side spinach salad was wonderful, perfect amount of dressing and the right mixture of ingredients.  It will be my main course the next time we are there.

There were six in my party last night and every food item was prepared as good as it gets.  The crab cakes were packed with 80% crab and 20 percent crumb at a minimum. I'm glad to know my second choice of entree would have been divine too.

Finally, Kelly was our server and boy did she shine.  All of us at the table love to banter and get to know our servers.  She held up admirably and made our night that much better. Her kindness and desire to make sure we did not want a thing was exactly what I would want in all of my restaurant visits.  Thank you Kelly for being the outstanding person you are and stay in school to help assure that bright future ahead of you.

Folks, this is a great place to kick back, get a glass of wine, some appetizers and then the full meal deal.  It's cozy, warm, and inviting.

P.S.    It was my birthday and they helped me celebrate by having everyone sign a birthday card and bringing me a candle to make a wish on.  It almost felt like home, really.

Go Now!"}

WAIT TIME:  We went for our daughter's 18th birthday mid-week.  The greeter knew this was for a special occasion.  We waited over an hour.  We even opted for the cook table for a faster seating, only to be offered to be seated at a tiny side bar with 4 chairs in a row near the prep area which we declined and continued to wait over 45 minutes more.  

STAFF:  The entire staff seems very young and/or inexperienced, not apologetic or accommodating in any way.  I asked to speak to the manager and had to wait 20 minutes to talk to him.  After speaking to him he told me where I could wait- I had been present at the bar enjoying a beer after waiting for over an hour.  Rude.
  
FORGOTTEN ORDER:  The server forgot the order for my husband, so he waited with an empty plate most of the night until we had to say something to the chef.   If you see an empty plate in front of someone you are serving, would the chef or the waitstaff not be attentive enough to ask what that person ordered?  

APPETIZER:  I ordered a dumpling at the bar when I was waiting there.  It was nothing special, we get the same kind at Sam's Club, frozen. 

THE SOUP:  Very skimpy on ingredients.  Only some very thin green onion slices and one slice of mushroom.  Nothing special, tasted of water and soy sauce, that's about it.   The other party at our table asked for additional mushrooms.  Good for them and they were raw, the chef didn't offer to soften them. . 

THE SALAD:  I enjoyed the Asian dressing.  This was okay.  It's kind of hard to mess up salad.

THE CHEF:  Seemed up tight.  He spent most of his time on the fried rice.  We ordered white rice and when ours came, it was colder than cold.   
I ordered scallops, the menu said they were the sea variety which you expect to be large sized.  When they came they were on the small side, more like the bay variety.  No seasonings were put on these scallops and I had to ask the chef to please give me some onions.  He had served the scallops to me without anything else on my plate.   After 2 hours of waiting.  I would prefer to have the entire meal ready at the same time, promptly and correctly.   This was well after 8 p.m. by now. 

UNDERCOOKED:  The zucchini was not well cooked, on the hard side.  He could have taken some time to steam it to soften it better, but all he did was fry it, which does not make for tender zucchini at all.  My husband ate most of this off my plate, as his plate was still empty.  He did not seem very into his cooking at all.  If you have ever tasted undercooked zucchini you know it is on the sour and rubbery side.  Yuck.  When things are prepared with a good attitude and with attention and care, they are a whole lot better in taste.  The chef dropped some of the utensils on the floor towards the end, he was very not into his craft.     

REFILLS:  I could not get a refill of water and after all the salty soy water soup, I could have used it.  The server was not around much to check this for me.  

SUMMARY:  Did I think this was worth it for a bowl of cold rice, rice water, a few tiny seared scallops, with 2 bites of hard zucchini and mostly a plate of caramelized onions?  What a rip off.  I should have stayed home!  The server tried to make up for his oversight with extra bowls of green tea ice cream.  Our daughter loves it, but I didn't care for the taste at all and neither did my husband.  So my daughter made out with 3 bowls; she does enjoy it.    

CLEANLINESS:  The bathroom:  Yuck!  Trash on floor.  Dirty floors.  

I won't be back anytime soon.   Zero stars if I could."}

It is a mid-level steakhouse with typical American fare.  The bar area was very bright (to many bright lights in my opinion) and busy.  

The BLT salad was terrible.  It was like that Costco mixed green salad that the cafeteria served in elementary school.  The salad showed up before the server even sat down my silverware and was completely drenched in salad dressing.  Tip: Ask for all dressing and sauces on the side.  The only thing worse that the salad was the service... One bartender was slinging drinks like a champ, the guy working with her completely left her hanging! Nevertheless, the meal continued :/ 

The worst thing in the world that could ever happen happened ... (Dramatic Pause) I actually had to send food back to the kitchen (glug, knife through my heart) I absolutely pride myself on not sending good back to anyone's kitchen but my medium rare steak came out with hoofs on still breathing, so rare.  The server didn't even attempt to argue, and rushed the plate back to the kitchen.

The refired steak was slightly better than the first but still not really delicious. I want to like this place ... I feel like it has potential.... So one star for the lady bartender and one for hope."}

We went here for my birthday and I had the filet medallions with a wine portobello sauce with a green Chiles mac and cheese...OMG freaking DELISH and worth every damn dime. My boyfriend got the prime rib and swore it was the best he ever had. 

When the manager stopped over we ranted and raved about our server, Michael and how awesome our meal was and she offered us a free dessert.  When my boyfriend told the manger it was my birthday...my dessert came with a candle and the server created a card with highlighter markers and had all the staff sign the card....This place is one of my favorites but tonight showed me they ROCK!

However...that isn't the case. When I arrived I checked in with the front desk girl. I let her know I had a reservation and my name. She asked me if my party was all accounted for and I let her know we were still waiting for a few. Maybe 5 minutes to by and the rest of our group show up. I go back to the same girl and let her know. She looks at me and asks me if I have a reservation...Now during this down time nobody checked in or was sat. It was a Wednesday night at 7:30 and it wasn't very busy. 
After I gave her my name again she let me know my reservation was for 7:45 and we would be sat shortly. So 18 minutes go by, yes I was timing it, and she comes over to me and asks me if I have a reservation and for my name...
At this point I just shake my head and ask her if she is serious. One of the other girls calls my name for the group and we go back. Unfortunately I will not visit again on a Wednesday night because of sheer incompetence that is presented as the first experience a guest receives. I wish I could move past and give a better rating but this girl has zero customer service skills and that makes me sad.

During dinner a few tables were complaining of very slow service and at one point an entire table got up and left and it was a birthday party. Sorry Benihana it just wasn't your night."}

The interior was clean and dark, reminding me of The Keg or a similar steakhouse atmosphere. The staff was very kind, and the customer service excellent. They had some good tunes pumped in as well. We jammed out some Boz Scaggs while dining.

As an appetizer, we had the coconut shrimp. They were cooked well, and were in a bed of unique citrus slaw, which was a hit at the table. The warm bread was also well received. The outside was crusty and the inside soft and buttery. My husband and I had the portabella sandwich; he with fresh fruit and me with tater tots (don't judge me) and a vegetarian black bean soup. The tots were hot and crisp. The fruit was, in fact, fresh, but was your normal fruit cup medley. The sandwich was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of balsamic - not too much to overpower. The rosemary focaccia was great, and absorbed the vinegar for a robust flavor. The vegetarian black bean soup was a bit too spicy for me, but packed tons of flavor. The first time around, I had to send it back because there was a giant unannounced ball of sour cream in the soup. I'm perplexed why one would list it as vegetarian, then drop a glob of animal product in there, which you find by surprise at the bottom of your bowl. I was disappointed in the ignorance of that menu move.

Our companions had the wood-grilled salmon with green beans and the pineapple chicken with garlic mashed potatoes. Both enjoyed their meals. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the beans fresh and al dente. 

Shared dessert was a warm carrot cake with warm caramel syrup. The piece of cake was huge... Definitely to be shared. The cream cheese frosting was utterly sinful. I had a cup of hot tropical green tea. They had a cute little box of Evolution tea. I enjoyed it greatly.

Lastly, I give huge props to our great server Aristotle. He was attentive and accommodating. He didn't split the bill like we asked, but that's not a big deal. My drink was always full, and an empty plate never stayed in the table for long. A replacement soup came fast and with apology, and leftovers promptly boxed and bagged.

For a party of 4, with meals, drinks, appetizers and dessert, the bill was around $150.

We felt thoroughly satisfied by our meal at Firebirds, and will certainly return in the future."}

This is the worst experience I have ever came across with this company. It was terrible from the start and continued on to the finish. 
First, I had a reservation for 7:45 and arrived with my girlfriend at approx 7:30. We were told it would be about 10 minutes (which is acceptable as we were early for our reservation), but ended up not being sat until 8:15. I had approached the host stand numerous times asking the progress for when it would be our turn. Every response was "You are the next table! We are just setting it up". Meanwhile, I would watch a couple more tables be sat... without me. The fact that I was forced to have a late dinner, along with being pulled along to stay was very rude and unnecessary. 
Next, my server, Tania, was absolute garbage for many reasons. To start, I had to BEG for her to come around and fill my empty water glass that eventually had no ice due to her lack of urgency. As she was taking the order, she asked if I wanted the fried rice which was cooked by the chef or something else. I stated I wanted brown rice when everyone got their fried entree. Not only did I not receive my rice until 80% of the way through my entire meal (30 minutes after fried rice was served), but when I asked for soy sauce she did not supply me with some until several minutes later. In fact, she came by the table to clear plates in the meantime and I had to AGAIN remind her for my needs. It was actually humorous as to how bad her service was, considering it was a relatively slow night for the restaurant. Yes she was nice, but man was she inconsiderate at my needs as a customer. 
Moving on, I get the check, which I also gave her my coupon for coming in on my birthday. She redid the total balance and gave me my revised check. The total was correct than and I, being a prior employee for 3 years in the restaurant industry, tipped her over 20% on the amount before any discounts applied knowing this is her form of income. I left and was happy to be out of there and finally have food in my stomach. 
Now the nightmare begins. As my total (before tip) was roughly $33ish dollars, and after tip just under $50, I get an email from Chase, my banking provider, stating I was charged well over $130. By the time I got home and noticed the screw up the store was closed and I figured I would call in the morning to have it resolved. 
In my hunt to get my bill adjusted properly, I had talked to some female manager on duty who was far from friendly. She told me that what I was charged was correct and that I am "crazy" for claiming I was charged over $130. She was beyond rude, arrogant, and overall left a terrible taste in my mouth to ever come back. I than had no other choice to call my bank who is now disputing my charge as Benihana could care less about the mistake that took part on their employees account. I am currently still getting it resolved, out of the additional funds they made a mistake on, and had no urge for reimbursement from them. All I want is to be charged the total I came in and dined in for but I guess in the world of Benihana, and the female manager in particular that is too much to ask. 

I will never go back to this location as they are unkind, disrespectful, careless, and beyond rude. 

On a final note, do not order shrimp from this location. My girlfriend and I were very uncomfortable with eating their dish as it was uncleaned shrimp and contained the black string of you know what in their contents. Very gross, but honestly after my experience with them yesterday and now today, I am not surprised. 

Overall stay away from Chandler Benihana, you will do yourself a favor. Terrible store, ran by terrible "leaders"."}

Yes, we still give 5 stars.  Today is my third or fourth visit.  My first visit was April 2010 on my anniversary.

I had the Aspen Sirloin, and it was very good.  Light seasoning, but just enough for a nice flavor.  Meat was juicy even though I like mine medium-well (very little pink).  Sometimes places when they try to achieve 'medium-well' will dry the steak out.  Firebirds got it just right!

The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also very nice.  Good flavor without being overpowering (Parmesan can be pretty strong).

And the bread service was great.  It comes out fresh and hot!  I love fresh bread still warm from the oven!  I do wish they had a wheat loaf like Black Angus, though.  But it was wonderful.

They offer numerous dishes here, not just steaks.  You can get salmon, chicken, pasta, even burgers and sandwiches.  So far I've tried the Aspen Sirloin, and the au poive steak (I've had that twice...it's totally awesome!).

Their fresh lemonade was perfect!  It's not the swill from the fountain.  This is real, fresh lemonade.  Truly wonderful.

A bit pricey, but I highly recommend this place if you want good American cuisine.  Nothing fancy, but what they do is done extremely well.  Simple flavors to accentuate the entree, not cover it up.  I'm not sure any of the high-end fancy places could do any better.  Probably not as good, in many instances."}

This restaurant was excellent in my opinion.  The bathrooms were as clean as the rest of the restaurant.  Our service and food were excellent, I don't really like Southeast Asian food but this was amazing.  Having it prepared right in front of us was definitely a treat.  The price was very reasonable as well, we have gotten away from other lesser quality restaurants with a bigger bill.  I ordered the Chicken Yakisoba, which was the most familiar thing for me on the menu, and was great.  The chef made us little 'appetizers' as we watched so we would not get hungry while waiting.  

The manager kept around us making sure we had the best experience we could.  For that I thank him, my family and I really enjoyed Benihana.

The place is clean and the service was good. However, the chef (which is the while experience) left a lot on the table so to speak. He was mediocre at best and really did not appear that he even knew how to cook onions, zucchini, or mushrooms as they were all still raw when he put them on our  plates. Maybe he was still training?

I have never had a bad meal here.  The place has a great wood smoked smell inside and it's a bit dark inside, which I kind of like and provides a nice atmosphere.  They have an open kitchen so you know your food hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 min.  During the winter, the bar inside is great, as it has a huge fireplace and an inviting atmosphere to partake in some cocktails.  The outdoor patio also has a fireplace and a great place to sit when it's not too hot.  

So what should you order there?  Here are my favorites, depending on your mood:

The filet wrapped in bacon is a delicious staple at Firebirds.  The meat is tender and always cooked perfectly (I like mine medium rare +).

Wood grilled salmon - some of the best salmon I have had!  LOVE the flavor of the wood.

Ahi tuna appetizer - if you're going light and like ahi, I highly recommend this from the starter menu.  The mustard sauce they serve with it has a mighty big kick and is one of my favorites.  I've tried to recreate it at home, without success. 

Green beans as a side option - ohhhh I know what you are thinking!!  Green beans? Yuck.  I'll get something else.  Well, everything is good but the green beans are the BEST!  They are sauteed with pecans and a little butter and they are soooo delicious.  You won't know it's a veggie!! 

As far as a chain restaurant goes, this is a top pick for me.  Check it out!!  You can't go wrong."}

There were people I was with who had never gone to something like this before... So it was disappointing. He even stacked the onions up and I told my friend next to me, get ready he's going to light it on fire!!! So he got his phone out to record it (other places do this) only to find out that random white guy was just going to scoot it slowly across the surface of he grill and pull out a whistle that sounded like small child's train toy, and act like the onions were a train.... Super lame dude. The food and show is better at AH SO and its less expensive and it's centrally located instead of driving all the way to chandler.

It was my birthday. The husband and I made reservations for 530 online. We checked in and sat down in front of the podium. I kid you not, at 610pm, after watching others with later reservations being seated, we had to remind the girl we had been waiting 40 minutes and had checked in at 530. We got a fast apology and were told that "so and so" was new and we would be seated next.
620 we were seated with 6 others that we did not know. 
Okay, fine, lets order up and get this going...

Our soup came. Barely lukewarm. The lady next to us fed hers to the baby and I drank it down like water, no spoon needed.

Our chef came over and went down the orders with everyone. Its now close to 7pm and I am starving. We ended up eating things randomly as they came: a bowl of fried rice. Then a few shrimp. Then a slice of zucchini. My four scallops. The onions and mushrooms kept cooking on the grill and I wound up eating bites of plain steak because I did not want them to get cold in the interim. 

I watched the others play pass the baby down the line because our chef barely spoke with us. I had more fun watching the table next to us being served.  

Its after 8pm at this point. I am waiting for our check and asking for the dessert to go because I don't think I can sit here any longer. $80 with tip and I even used a birthday coupon. 

There's a lot of "maybe's" here: maybe the chef was new. Maybe the girl up front was new. Maybe three hours to eat a meal is a long time.  Maybe I should have asked for a no kid table since I left my THREE kids home so I could enjoy my dinner. I am disappointed. MAYBE they can do better if I decide to come back. Maybe..."}

When it came time to check out, he returned our booklet without returning the credit card used for payment. We got up to look for the waiter and found the credit card on the ground, under another table across the restaurant. Overall, our Sunday night out turned into a frustrating, three-hour endeavor.

 Thinking we'd be called next.  After 40 minutes we checked back in and were told that we have only waited 40 of the 90 minutes. They had six open tables and only the walk ins waiting. 

I would understand this type of reservation based seating at a high end place in Scottsdale but in chandler, come on! I called the manager and complained but he stated that they need to plan an hour and a half ahead and that's why they keep the tables empty. I guess I didn't understand the Benihana seating plan. 

my advice is to make reservations and only show up with reservations, otherwise you'll leave pretty pissed just like me. We will never come back to the Benihana in chandler, Scottsdale is where it's at! They understand how to seat people."}

The restaurant is about 60% full. Not very bustling for the "most romantic night of the year". First time here and I like the interior. It's like a nice upscale cabin. Very classy lumberjack.

My daughters ordered off the kids' menu (chicken strips and hamburger). Their meals look excellent for being kids' meals. They both got two sides (fresh veggies and fresh fruit, but could've chosen fries, green beans, Mac & cheese, or parmesean mashed potatoes). The burger looks good quality and chicken strips came with honey mustard and were delicious. Yes, I tried them. It was came with a small two cookie pack of Oreos.

I ordered a medium rare aged 14oz ribeye with a loaded baked potato. The loaded potato looked exactly like the one at Texas Roadhouse. I'm not opposed to that, but for $6 less, I could've gotten a bigger ribeye and the same potato. The ribeye was overcooked, on the latter end of the medium well side. Almost well done. Very little pink. Decent seasoning, but dry and chewy.

The service was very lacking. Our waitress was so hard to get ahold of that the burger went ketchup-less and my iced tea went sugar-free for about half of our meal. BUT, she was nice and apologetic and at least seemed genuine about it. Not sure why we were ignored though. 2.76489 stars but I'll round up to 3"}

No hassle at all and redeems the evening for us. I never get his name but he has orangish red hair very pleasant guy.  Even the servers are kind and on point.

She then states "it's going to be an hour or so" as though she didn't have time for us and wanted us to leave, which she accomplished. My husband did get a hold of the manager over the phone to complain about the hostess. The manager promised a return phone call by 5pm on Thursday but never called.

Another poster says that Firebirds is her favorite chain restaurant. I have to agree, largely because it never felt like a chain restaurant. The servers are friendly and attentive, the food is always good, and the ambience is pleasant - quiet enough to have a conversation without feeling like you are eating in a library.

For lunch, the Seared Ahi Tuna is melt-in-your-mouth good. The Firebirds BLT Salad is way too sinful to be called "salad," but I will call it "delicious." And the Durango Burger is to die for. It is piled too high for the average person to eat without a knife and fork, but I unhinged my jaw and took it down. Yum!

At dinnertime, I definitely enjoyed the Double Black Diamond Martini. Possibly a little too sweet, but really good just the same. You can't go wrong with the Sesame Encrusted Salmon. It was tender and juicy.

*Sigh* Now I am hungry. Time to plan an AZ visit and a stop at Firebirds!"}

Called ahead to put us on the waiting list and informed it would be 50 mins wait. Arrived 30 mins after making a phone call, still told another 30 mins. Since a patio table was available right away, decided to take a patio table, I thought it was nice.

Service.... I think other server beside our assigned server was more helpful than her. She would often forget things, my glass of coke stayed empty for a while, just seemed overwhelmed and tend to not care about us on the patio. Other servers were nice.

Food.... I had blue cheese filet with loaded baked potato. Since they coated potato with so much salt, every time potato shifts on my plate, excess salt will get on steak, making my food overly salty. filet mignon was okay, had better cut. Blue cheese was nice, unfortunately it just got too salty from baked potato, I just couldn't eat anymore. Complimentary bread was actually very tasty. 

Nice ambiance, located near the Chandler mall, perhaps I visited during their off day, but based on my first visit, this place will not be my first choice of restaurant to eat again as there are so many options nearby."}

The fried rice is 1.25 more to add on and although tasty, I don't feel that its worth it to pay extra. It is fun to watch them make it though. Here's the weird thing: my favorite part of the meal (next to the Vegas roll) is their vegi's. The zucchini and onions taste sooo good with all the butter in them!!! Of course, everything is better with butter! Another good thing about the meals is you get soup and salad so you feel like the price is a little more reasonable. The soup is very brothy but has a great onion flavor to it. The salad on the other hand has a ginger dressing that I am not a fan of. All in all, benihana, although a little overpriced, has some terrific food and its a great place to take a date. The show the chefs put on it very fun, however, it doesnt change much from chef to chef if you have been more than once. Oh one other understated item: their tempura banana's for dessert. Delectable! Everyone should try Benihana and their dam Vegas Roll at least once in their lives. A final tip: If you expect great service, do not sit in the bar to have dinner. We made the mistake of doing that once and had to wait forever for everything! Sit at the tables if you are planning to have more than drinks. WORD!"}

The hostess was not friendly, we waited a while to be seated, even with a reservation. The server was a little more friendly and became gradually more attentive (I think because she realized everyone at our table was getting frustrated), but never really hit the service mark. It took an unreasonable amount of time for the drink orders, and for courses to begin coming. 

Then the chef. God bless him. He was new, not Asian, exhausted, and really slow. He kept misreading the ticket, kept serving food we'd ordered to the strangers at the table with us, he missed about every little "trick" he tried, and he was clearly nervous (and apparently gets chatty when he's nervous). He was sweating over our food profusely.... until the server came over and turned the vent on 3/4 of the way through the little show. The meal was served so slowly that it was cold and you couldn't enjoy your food. Portions were small and the flavor was bland... I had the hibachi chicken and it was overcooked.... the veggies were burned on bottom and zucchini was slimy on top.... There was so much to be appalled at that when the lady came and asked how our meal was, we just said "fine" so we could leave quicker and never return.  I'm pretty sure if we'd complained we'd have just gotten another card for corporate... We were very disappointed and I felt really bad for the experience my son DIDN'T get to have for his special day. You can't have that moment back, you know...  but I wish I could. I would definitely have chosen more wisely.  It was not worth the money spent."}

Despite notifying and reminding the waiter, chef and manager on multiple occasions, my daughter's birthday was ignored while another child, who was at our table, birthday was the focus of the entire meal. The other family even pointed out that there were two kids with birthdays at the table. That was a bummer - so much for going to Benihana for special occasions. 

Also, the carpet is very dirty which makes you feel that other things may be neglected. That being said when you are sitting at the cooktop and the chef is doing a good job obeying all the food-handling regulations you worry less. 

I ordered Seafood Diablo and several of the ingredients listed on the menu were missing. I asked for this spicy dish extra-spicy. My dish was cooked last (no big deal) but then when it was served and others were finishing, our waiter started working another table and I couldn't get a drink to save my life.  

Also, I know the chefs have to learn but our chef was noticeably less skilled compared to the other chefs on shift this evening. That's just bad luck of the draw, but seemed to be the way this night was going. All in all, it was a very bad experience."}

So by now I am just grateful to finally eat at 10:30pm so being my first time at Benihanas I was super excited to taste the food I hear so much about.  Well let me tell you that is was maybe mediocre at best, I say not much better than Dennys. So to say the least I will never be returning to Benihanas EVER. All they could do was say sorry and that was all. If I wanted to eat Dennys grade food I would have saved myself alot of money.  Spending $160 on  not only horrible service but also terrible food is not how I wanted to spend my fiance birthday or my first visit to any establishment."}

It was packed when we arrived but not overwhelming. The place was decorated so nicely for New Years with balloons everywhere. I started off with the Mirassou Pinot Noir wine. This was delicious and extremely smooth. For our entree, I ordered the Filet Mignon, medium. When they first brought it out and I tried it, it didn't taste medium at all. It was actually more well. Our waiter took my plate back so they can re do my order. A few minutes later the manager came over to apologize for the inconvenience. When they brought out my new order again, the manager was there to make sure it was exactly what I wanted. 

Even for a medium, I felt like the Filet was a bit dry. However, they have spectacular customer service. I would definitely come back."}

We went for my sisters birthday and we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. When we arrive 15 minutes before our reservation time we checked in but was not seated until 20 minutes after our original reservation time with no explanation... Others were sat first and I was confused as I'm sure they didn't have a reservation at the same time as us. To blow off some stress and kill time while we waited I decided I would go to the bar while we waited. The bartender told the only 3 empty seats were taken for some regulars who will be on there way shobeing reserved for some one coming shortly... I thought that was odd but I said forget it and  just got my scotch and went to our table because it was finally "Ready". When we sat no one acknowledged us for 15 minutes and I tried to get everyone's attention but no one even looked our direction. When a waiter finally did come we asked to speak with the manager who immediately made it seem like we were being impatient but said I'll switch your server anyway. I was heated at this point so I walked out and have no intention of going back.

The only reason I think it has to do with our race is because my sisters and I were the only black People there, and it just didn't feel right.

I must say that there isn't any consistency with this place. The one here in chandler is not very good. I think they are surviving off of the reputation not customer service. First the girl working as the hostess needs to learn how to smile and actually act like she likes her job. Word of advice for her. If you can't smile, be cordial, have a personality then quit and find another line of work but obviously interacting with the public is not your calling. 

Very long wait to eat.... The servers are slow and you have to wait forever just to get drinks and refills...

Its very expensive, so we only really go when we get our birthday coupons for $30 off. (sign up on their website for their emails and you get a free meal on your birthday)

 There is a waitress who works there most nights (I  have it written down somewhere because i can't remember her name) she works the tables usually in the front of the building on the left side. She is amazing! We always request tables in her area. 

My husband has many food allergies and she pays extra attention to make sure his food is allergy free. 

Fried rice here is amazing, hibachi style food is alwas great, service is a little bit slow, you may be waiting a little while to get your drinks  refilled but They get pretty busy, and the waiters definitely hustle. 

This is a restaurant you go to take time and enjoy yourself and your friends and family. If you're in a rush anywhere, come for the lunch specials and avoid the dinner crowd."}

It is, by far, the most pretentious restaurant I've eaten at. Every single employee from the hostess, to the server, to the chef, to the manager, asked us if we celebrating a special occasion. Why didn't they just say we're so over priced, no one would eat here unless it's their anniversary or birthday. 

There are so many other teppanyaki restaurants around the valley that are just as good, if not better. I would probably go to one of them (many of which are not chains) before heading back to Benihana."}

First time was pretty upsetting. We had to wait ~45 minutes for a dinner table, at which point they sat us in the bar area. The waitress was rarely to be seen and served me won-ton soup in a chipped bowl (serious health code violation - took a picture). Half-way through our meal, they sat some people with us at our small table which made it somewhat awkward.

Second time was much better. We made reservations and got seated at the Hibachi table. Chef was quite exciting and entertaining, keeping everyone involved. Had some good cold Sake with apple flavor, the rest of the food was pretty standard.

Be sure to sign up for their birthday promotion ($30 off one person's meal), but keep in mind that it is for one person only (they are pretty serious about that)!"}

now on to the prime rib.  we ordered ours rare and the server came back and said they were out of rare that we would have to settle for medium if we still wanted it.  anyways...we went ahead and ordered it "medium." i was still looking forward to it.  the prime rib showed up and we were stoked....until we tried it.  this thing had absolutely NO flavor to it...not even after you soaked it in the au jus. it was a $22 bad decision.  lame.
i forgot what my kiddo ordered but i will say he barely touched it.
best part about this trip was when we were leaving i was able to feed the left over prime rib to a stray cat sitting outside (yes..i took the leftovers to go...i hate complaining to the staff).

Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. I had the peppercorn encrusted steak-- perfectly done, very flavorful, and so delicious! I also ordered the Firebird BLT salad. My only "complaint" was that it had a bit too much bacon. Their signature pineapple martini was to die for! The perfect amount of sweet and tanginess. I'm giving this 4 stars because their wine list was just so so and our server kept pushing the restaurant's new wine. Also, the desert selection was not great-- there was nothing really creative on there that really excited me."}

That new place because a favorite of mine in Chandler.  I would go as to say this is probably the best steak Ive had in town.  

When you first pull int the parking lot, you can smell the grill from a mile away.  Just an incredible smell.  Thinking about it right now makes me want to jump into my car and head over there.

The staff is very nice there and of course like all fine dining places, everyone there looks like they stepped off of GQ and Vogue Magazines. The place has a nice steakhouse feel to it.  Wood all over, deer head mounted on all, and you can see the cooks making your food right in the back.  Always nice to see what's going on with the food.  

The things I love most about this place is their bread.  Fresh sour dough loaves that come out piping hot with butter.  I call it "Butt Bread;" for those who have been here, you know why.  Best bread Ive had at a restaurant.

Another great addition is their BLT salad.  They have this great garlic ranch dressing that I have not seen anywhere else.  That with bacon bits, lettuce and tomato... delicious.

My personal favorite is their rib-eye and their dipped in, loaded baked potato.  I get the same thing every time now.  Yes I have tried other things and they were amazing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.

My parents went with my girlfriend and I once and my dad ate 3 loaves of the bread himself.  Yeah... good stuff."}

Last night 6 of us dined there for 3 Birthday Celebrations and shared a table with a couple who was also celebrating a Birthday. We had a 715pm reservation, got seated on time, got a Chef at 845pm. Our waiter came at 830pm n said that his Manager is giving free appetizers for the wait, this is after we had our Soup n Salad. Around this time we let the server know that two guests found hair in their soup, he said the Manager will be over to discuss. The Manager never came so my friend flagged him down to inform him n he disregarded her complaint and walked off. We found out that this was the District Manager.  He never comes back as requested. Our Chef comes rushing us through the service because he says there's only 5 Chefs for the whole restaurant and he's being yelled at in the back to quickly finish our meal. Burned food, not enough rice prepared, waiter was overwhelmed and I blame Management. Instead of seating more tables they should have delayed others reservations or turned people away. Three out of six of us was first n last time guests. We got 15% off the bill but that's not sufficient at all. The Chefs portion of the meal is the main attraction n Benihana Chandler failed last night."}

An online banker buddy from San Diego was in town for training, so I decided to meet her for dinner. This restaurant was across the street from her hotel and sounded really interesting. Turns out, I was right.

Since neither of us are big eaters, we decided to split and entree and add a side. We were both eying the blue cheese filet medium rare (great minds think alike!) Sara mentioned that sprinkling some of the blue cheese over sweet potato waffle fries is terrific; I thought the addition of green beans would help balance the meal. They actually brought out our meal on two plates (perhaps this is common now, but I remember having to portion split meals myself). The filet was perfect. Perfect!! The blue cheese slightly melted into the meat, crispy bacon tucked around it all. Adding a bit of the cheese to the fries were phenomenal (seriously, you have to give this a try). The green beans with candied pecan pieces added a nice fresh crunch to the dinner.

As much as I *hate* to drive long distances, I really would consider returning here just to have what I'm certain would be another terrific meal. Thanks, Western Union, for picking up the majority of the bill."}

The remaining 3 people arrived at 4:48 pm. By 5:15 - 5:20 we were still waiting to be seated. We were here for a birthday celebration and I was extremely surprised that with more than 1/2 of our party and time to spare that they wouldn't seat us. We had a few small kids, a baby in a carrier, an 89 year old woman and they made us wait long afterward to be seated. 

This was my first visit to Benihana and I wasn't completely impressed with the start of our visit. However, by the time we were seated things eased up a little bit. Although, interesting that no one made any mention of the hold up or the reasoning for the hold up since our table was open that entire time. Our chef was awesome! I wish I could recall his name because I actually saw him mentioned on here and was super excited when he was assigned to our table. 

He did a stupendous job of impressing the kids and was very enjoyable to watch. I had the Yakisoba, the salad and the miso soup. Yes. it was amazingly good. I had bites of everyone's dish and they were all good. Really really good. I couldn't finish my entire dish so I ended up taking it home and upon reheating it, it was still very very good. 

I wasn't responsible for paying the tab but from what I hear it really is expensive. So, as long as someone else is covering dinner I am totally in. HA! Seriously though, it's worth the experience even if it isn't a regular occurrence."}

I had Scallops, Calamari, and Shrimp.  Dad did as well.  We enjoyed it.  Mom went with the Filet Mignon and I was allowed a bite and mmm, mmm - delicious and tender, melted in my mouth.

I now want to go to the one in San Francisco, as every time I try to go to it there, it is always busy.

We dined midday between the lunch and dinner crowds and enjoyed a quiet meal in a fairly empty venue. It smells delicious inside! I wonder if they pipe in that smoky smell or if it's truly wafting from that kitchen? The interior is well appointed, clean, and shows pride in this franchise. I ordered the Surf & Turf (which I was CRAVING) with the BLT salad, and stole more than my fair share of crisp, mouthwatering tater tots from my husband's plate. The filet was prepared a perfect medium rare and melted in my mouth. It's bacon-wrapped with light seasoning that doesn't distract from the natural flavor of the cut. The lobster tail is substantial in size - more than expected - tender, not overly seasoned, and had a slightly smoked flavor. Our young server Lulu was attentive, offered helpful suggestions, and was quite patient & accommodating as we made a multitude of substitutions when we ordered due to dietary considerations. Our glasses were never empty and every request was met with gracious politeness. Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu which offers a variety of selections without becoming overwhelming. The GM stopped by our table to chat - which is always a nice touch. We will definitely come back next time I crave Surf & Turf. It was well priced at around $40 and worth every penny."}

Went with my mom prior to a concert this week and Son, I was not disappoint. Service from waitstaff was prompt, professional and never "hovering". Mom had the peppercorn sirloin with the au poive sauce and raved about it. I had the center-cut sirloin, medium rare and it was outstanding. I almost did a double take on the thickness; it was approaching filet thickness and grilled to perfection. Spiced pecan green beans ($6) as an added side was worth every penny.

I'll definitely be back. If mom is a party to where to eat in the future, I think she will persuade others that Firebirds is a legitimate candidate for steak."}

Very nice to see that your food is cooked fresh in front of you, but it's too bad they use the same oils and sauces to cook everything in, makes it a bit bland, but not horrible. Fried rice is the best! Sushi, not so much.

Been here a couple times and secretly wish they could do maybe a slightly different version of entertainment... possibly? Don't wanna sound mean, but I know everything that they're gonna do already.

Last I was there the service in the sushi lounge was poor, the entree I ordered in the sushi lounge was nothing like what you would get at a hibachi grill. The chicken was rubbery and tough and had some spicy sauce lazily drizzled on top it wasn't even cooked in it. The sauces have diminished over the years to being bitter runny goo and the dressing isn't much better. Wish they would get their act together and return to their former glory. I have forgiven them time and time again, even when one meal I had sand in my salad but I'm kind of saddened that I won't be returning until something changes. Also worth mentioning my friend was there a week ago and there was a large cockroach crawling on the floor inside the dining room."}

They were full and she said they could seat us by 7:15 so we moved it up 15 minutes.  The hostess also asked me if we were celebrating anything this evening and I told her 39 years of marriage!  She said wonderful and would alert our server!  She also stated we will try to make your evening memorable!  Great we are off to a good start!

We arrived at 7:10 and checked in.  There were people waiting everywhere, outdoors, on the patio, in the rocks out front, in the bar, waiting room, etc. We were promptly told that they were running 10 to 15 minutes behind schedule.  No biggie as things happen.  30 minutes later we checked with the hostess and we were informed that there were still 3 parties in front of us.  15 minutes later we were seated (7:55 p.m.) a full 40 minutes after our reservation.  How nice it would have been to have the hostess tell us "thank you for waiting or thank you for your patience".  Nothing, just "this way please".  We waited for another 10 minutes for a cocktail waitress to visit our table.  It was now 8:05 and we were very hungry so we asked the women to send our waitress to our table with menus.   When our waitress arrived, she was laughing and stated that she had had quite a night with a "prime rib disaster" they had experienced.  My poor husband just looked at me as that was what he was looking forward to ordering.  Again, she never said "thank you so much for waiting", or attempted to explain what she meant  or give any details to the prime rib disaster she mentioned.  We received our menus and another 10 minutes passed.  We flagged down the cocktail waitress and asked to send her to send our waitress to our table.  She came by and took our order.  We promptly received our delicious bread and for the next 25 minutes we completely consumed it.  Finally about 8:55 our food arrived.  By now we are just trying to make a bad evening good.  

We were very pleasantly surprised by our food (the only good spot in the evening and the reason for the 3 stars)  I ordered a filet mignon, which was probably the best filet I have had in 2 decades!  The baked potato was also a delight.  My husband did not have enough faith in the restaurant to order the prime rib so he ordered a steak and garlic mashed potatoes.  Also cooked to perfection.   The wine I ordered had tasted as if it had been sitting around for a while.  

When our waitress brought the dessert menu, my husband asked if they had anything special.  Our waitress asked why and he explained that it was our 39th.  She acted like it was the first she heard about it.  She said she would ask and see what she could do.   Of course by now you could probably write the script.  She took another 10-15 minutes to get back to our table and asked if we were ready to order.  Clearly she had forgotten our last conversation.  By now my husband finally said how disappointed he was in our experience.  She listened patiently and said she would send over the manager to talk to us.  Yep, you guessed it another 10 minutes and nothing.  5 minutes later she brought our check and said the manager discounted our order.  

It is so sad to see a fine restaurant so poorly managed.  The hostesses need to be better trained as well as the wait staff.  We sat there and thought of several ideas for them.  When we were seated, they could have said they were offering discounts on wine and beer or something.  Anything just throw us a bone!   Honestly it would have been wonderful to get the manager's side of the story.  The food though was excellent.  We left at 9:55, over 2.5 hours after our arrival.  Not sure if the food is worth the mismanagement."}

Looking around 5 other tables were still waiting. The cook didn't start cooking until almost 9:15. His food cart was not stocked. He didn't have enough shrimp and vegetable appetizers for the whole table. My husband didn't get vegetables because he ran out. The guy made it seem like a huge inconvenience to get more since he already made it for everyone else so my husband didn't get any even though I asked him to please get more since we are paying for it. The guy could not keep track of who ordered what and was putting the wrong food in the wrong plates and just kept making jokes about it. He was also making a bunch of racist jokes and comments. He also let us know he was just fired from his last job a few weeks ago. Once everything was done it was past 1030 and we were just trying to leave and we asked for the bill and no desert since we were there so long and the waitress took 15min just to bring our checks back. (she told us her coworkers played a joke on her and locked her in the freezer). We finally left right before 11pm. 4 hours and $100 bucks later..safe to say our whole night was ruined."}

We did, however, go to reminisce on this sort of restaurant, and expected a decent well-priced meal with a fun atmosphere. 

While the filet was delightful (shockingly so), and the yellowtail sashimi sufficient for our expectations, the Las Vegas roll was severely lacking, and the rest of the meal was served after apparently sitting around for a while.  Lukewarm food just doesn't cut it.  While we had hoped to enjoy the visit, there were just too many reminders why we haven't been in nearly ten years.  Nor will we return."}

Thankfully, he had fam in town so we were able to sneak away to Benihana for some eats. Let's be honest, you know I had some drinks, too!

He had dined there before, but I had never tried out the establishment.  I made our reservation for 5:15, but when we arrived we were informed that they were running about 15-20 minutes behind. No biggie to us, we just bellied up to the bar and enjoyed some happy hour priced bevs (a peach sangria number and a patron margarita -which wasn't a happy hour item).  Once our table was ready, we were seated with a family of 6 at a spot near the entrance. 

There were quite a few options for food and we both ended up getting the filet (mine with steamed rice and his with a double order of the chicken fried rice). The server was nice and was careful to take down everyone's order correctly.  All of our meals came with onion soup to start and then a small salad with a ginger vinaigrette, followed by a shrimp appetizer. We were having a gay ole time and then our chef, Stephen, came out.  He was good at keeping us all entertained, cooking the food at a perfect pace and made our steaks gloriously medium rare!  I loved the entire meal (and so did my boo).  I wouldn't say this is a place I'd go to all of the time, but I'd definitely come here for the occasional "dinner and a show"."}

Not even close. Benihana might have been hip about the time Godzilla and Bruce Lee were in their prime. A time when Japanese cuisine might have come across as exotic to most Americans so all the mystical kung fu clown aspects of the Teppanyaki restaurant food preparation process were quite the spectacle and even a reason to come to a Benihana in the first place. Nowadays nobody other than some hermit from Appalachia would find this exotic. It is, unfortunately, old hat. So when a rep from a vendor that is currently figuratively bending us over and letting us have it like we were the proverbial large minority inmate's new bitch - decided to treat us to a lunch at Benihana it almost felt like a slight. Like hey you little short bus riders - you may find this spectacle awe-inspiring and a great lunch. Either that or maybe he really didn't know any better and finds the whole thing fascinating and awesome himself like he fell out of a short bus himself. So anyway we all show up at Benihana except for our department's resident tard (you know the type - there's at least one in every group) who we had to wait for because they would not start until ALL guests arrive. They wouldn't even SEAT us until he did. Pssht. Once he finally got there we were taken to our table where we pretty much were able to order immediately. Once all our orders were taken this guy comes over to our table and begins the show. He mumbled something in what was probably Japanese really quickly as he started and began his chopsocky cutlery show. His whole schtick was adding a sauce or spice and each time he added something he would pretend it was something else when he announced what he was doing - chocolate instead of soy sauce or gasoline instead of sake and so on. He chopped all of our vegetables up and he chopped all of our vegetables down. It was an ancient Japanese art and everybody knew their part. Everybody was... quite entertained. Food? Definitely had better. Benihana is for kids, you silly rabbit! After we were done eating it felt like the staff wanted us not to linger and GTFO so they could prepare for the next wave. Probably won't be back unless some other vendor decides to treat us like their bitch and bring us here for lunch. Plenty of parking as it shares a lot with other restaurants in the restaurant row on the south side of Chandler Blvd (just north of Chandler Fashion Center)."}

I called and even spoke to a manager to make a reservation for a large party of about 20 . made the reservation a while before the event . when I made it nothing else was asked of me other then my name and amount and time I had asked about their prime rib since I had read it was good and this was my whole reason for chosing this place they raved about it and mentioned nothing else. The day of the event I was approached by a different manager as we waited for our seat . he asked some small talk type of questions but then asked something that had me a bit confused, he asked if we had done or requested a particular menu. This had me worried and I knew something was gonna be up since no onenhad mentioned that to me. We got sat down and most of it was lovely the bread was good . they had two waitresses that took care of us that did a good job . but no one mentioned anything about menu items. Our reservation was a bit later but still several hours before they close. When it came time to order meals I ordered the prime rib I had been waiting for . only to find out they had ran out . at least 5 others in my party were also trying to order the prime rib and this was very upsetting that even when I was making a reservation and specifically asking about the prime rib did no one mention to me it was limited per day and would be out long before we arrived . or that there was an option to request a specific menu so maybe they could hold some for us ? Not sure how that would have worked cud no one explained it to me . but this experience which other wise should have been fine was ruined by this. The steak I did have was alright . not amazing but not what I had been craving for a month. The service its self was good for the large party we had the wait staff took care of us well. You do wait a little longer for things but its to be expected for a place like this. Just kinda put a bad taste I'm my mouth and could have been handled much better."}

We opted for seating in the lovely patio, since the weather was so wonderful,  some good conversation, and people watching. For me, a signature martini,  double black diamond which consists of fresh pineapple and citrus vodka. Served with a wedge of sweet, sliced pineapple. Since this is happy hour, they are half off, which equates to  $5.00. During their non- happy hour times, they can be a bit spendy. 
I had only planned on Happy hour drinks, but I thought about it and it is Friday and it's been a long week, and the salmon on the menu was calling my name.  I went with the grilled smoked salmon and the presentation was nice, the fish was cooked just right, and comes with a baked potato and a veggie.  Mr H just went with a salad, but he did confess that he really enjoyed my salmon I ordered.  
The server was friendly enough, and I enjoyed the food. If you come only for happy hour, they also have half priced apps, which is your typical sliders, wings, queso and chips. Half off on their martini's and I believe some of their beer is on the HH list.  Happy Hours: monday-friday and ends at 7pm.  Can you believe it? this is my 100th review."}

Each time I have gone, the food and service has been great. Their bread is probably one of the best bread loaves I have ever had and I can make a meal out of that and that alone. Freshly baked and slightly doughy still, its magnificent. When I first started going to Firebirds, I would order the pork tenderloin with a sweet and sour glaze and the southwest au gratin potatoes. Sooooo good. Now its no longer on the menu   :(   Anyways, I have found a replacement in the grilled salmon with veggies and Parmesan mashed potatoes.I always ask for peach salsa on the side too to put on the fish. It is honestly one of the best salmon meals I have ever had at any restaurant and surprisingly, one of the healthiest items at Firebirds. I love that they list their nutrition facts on their website. Anyways, my husband loves the prime rib and loaded baked potato. He says that the prime rib is consistently good and flavored really well. Also, Firebirds has some awesome wings for appetizers and their tortilla slaw with coconut shrimp appetizer is to die for. The slaw is so different but very tasty. Oh and for dessert, their key lime pie and brownie sundae are pretty legit. There are only a couple of things that I have tried that I was not overly impressed with: Tortilla soup (creamier than I like and not much flavor), pecan crusted trout was kinda dry. 
The service at Firebirds has always been great. There was one time when my salmon was raw in the middle. The waitress took it away and continuously apologized. A manager came over and offered to give me any appetizer and as much bread as I wanted at no charge while I waited for my meal to be recooked. They also gave me dessert on the house. The managers as well as their staff genuinely care about the customers it seems which is something I haven't seen in a long time at other restaurants. Their prices are also decent. I personally thought the prices, service, and quality of food at Firebirds far surpassed The Keg.
My husband and I will definitely continue to come to this restaurant over places like the Keg and more upscale steakhouses!"}

I loved my first visit so much, I took my Mom and her husband for dinner there a few days later!  His fave meal there is the buffalo meatloaf w/ sautéed mushroom gravy w/ sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and spiced pecan green beans.  LOVE the spiced pecan green beans!!  My Mom and I adore the seafood entrees served here; she especially loves the tempura-battered shrimp w/ tortilla slaw, FANTASTIC mango habañero chutney and huge steak fries.  I regularly order the pecan crusted trout, w/c comes w/ cilantro peach salsa and tortilla slaw.  While the peach salsa is so tasty and the slaw delicious and marvelously crunchy, my  allergies prevent me from enjoying them, so I always ask for substitutions of mango habanero chutney and spiced pecan green beans, the latter being so sinfully good!!  [According to the restaurant's online nutrtitional guide, It's also calorific AND loaded w/ saturated fat, but hey, I don't smoke tobacco or "creative" cigs, nor do drugs, and I rarely drink (yeah, what fun am I to have around, eh?), so I allow myself occasional splurges w/ certain foods!  So you see, my allergies are blessings of sorts...]

In the appetizers menu, the lobster spinach queso, coconut shrimp, chicken quesadilla, CRABCAKES, and chicken tortilla soup are all scrumptious!  (Yes, I enjoyed many of these items before I learned that the awful cramps and other seemingly crazy and non-sequential symptoms I'd experience afterwards were caused by food allergies!)

Desserts here are also pretty amazing.  Try their seasonal bread puddings!!  I've tried two versions- one w/ white chocolate and another w/ liquors of dark chocolate and bourbon, perhaps?  I also enjoy a few appetizers offered at half-price during happy hour: buffalo wings, sliders w/ french fries, onion rings, and RIBS!  If you like citrus-y beverages, try Firebirds' signature martini, the Double Black Diamond- fresh pineapple steeped in citrus vodka and garnished w/ a pineapple slice!  

I did make a phone call about a month ago and found that HH appetizer selections have changed to reflect the seasons, so you may want to call ahead if you're like me and suffer from food allergies...

Last, but not least, while table and bar services here can be very spotty, management usually does a fine job w/ follow-ups and corrections.  I also enjoy the ambience here... reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of summers spent in Baguio, the summer capital of Luzon.  Woods, everywhere!  Beams, tables, chairs, floors, restrooms...  There's even a nice fireplace!"}

That and a loaded baked potato.
One of the others in our party ordered the filet, medium well.
The steaks arrived, and I was really looking forward to it, after the terrific salad...cut into it...hmm...kind of overdone...tried the other side...medium well...
My friend's filet was beautifully rare.
Neither of us were very happy about it.  
I feel guilty sending overcooked steaks back (hey, the cow gave it's all for the steak - don't throw it away) - good thing I got the chile rub - that made it acceptable.

Really disappointed - had the steak been cooked the way I ordered it, this would've gotten 5 stars.  :-("}

My comments are sometimes influenced by my previous experience working at a restaurant. 

Wait Time/Front Desk Staff: Our wait time for 2 people was quoted 30-40 min. We didn't mind waiting, but then people started showing up and being seated before us because they did a call ahead. Since it was our first time there, we didn't know they did call ahead. Personally, I think it's ridiculous for a restaurant to allow call ahead for parties less than 5. It's honestly ridiculous, since most of the people that were seated before us were only parties of 2. We also waited longer than our quoted time, by about 10-15 min more. Most of the front desk staff were just standing around doing nothing and talking to each other. None of them bothered tidying up around their area. They were just talking.

Server/Service: We weren't greeted for a good 15-20 min. I'm guessing the hostess sat us at a table and forgot to tell one of the servers to cover our table. Other tables that were seated after us, were greeted by their servers before our server came. I don't really blame the server since they probably didn't know. It's the front desk staff that should have notified the server. Our server was OK, but barely actually served us. The food runners that brought us our food. were a lot more friendly and responsive. We wished either of them were our server. 

Food Quality: The complimentary bread was good and big. We shared the onion rings as an appetizer and a full slab of ribs. The onion rings were amazingly delicious! Probably the best panko onion rings I've ever tried. The ribs were ok. I didn't really enjoy the sauce. There was a strong bitter after taste that I didn't like, but the meat fell off the bone nicely. 

Ambience: It's a little notch above casual, but not too upscale. The tables are relatively close to each other. Dim lighting. I didn't like that I could actually see the food line. Personally, I think that should be a behind the scenes kind of thing.

Overall, we'd come back for the food and do a reservation or call ahead next time."}

I've gone for dinner 4 or 5 times in the past 3-4 yrs which makes it about once a year...definitely good enough to return (we went last Friday night) but I think the reasons I don't return more often are:
a) a bit pricey ($5 for a side of mushrooms is kinda crazy)
b) menu is pretty limited and nothing is spectacular or even unique
c) there are so many other restaurants--especially in that Chandler Mall area--that something else always wins out

That being said, I've never had a bad experience. Steaks/Prime Rib have always been cooked exactly as I ordered and the Salmon is wonderful too. Wish the dinners came with a vegetable or salad as well as the potato but, alas...

Service has always been attentive and the hosting staff never snotty. Like the dimly lit lodge look of the place as well.

Yes, I would recommend this place but with price/menu caveats mentioned above."}

The food was decent, I had the Land n' Sea (filet mignon and scallops), especially with the 'meat sauce?'.

This is not really my go-to restaurant since I usually prefer more ethnic or unique food.

A few stuff on the walls to make it clear that they have a theme but not overly kitchy.  Over the last few years we have taken a lot of people here and everyone always leaves happy.

Well done, Firebirds!"}

Anytime I make a reservation for just myself I can never seem to get seated with another group but instead have to wait for other walk-ins before they seat me. The weather is nice and it's not his fault... But it's now been 30 minutes and I still don't even have a drink yet., nor placed my order. My suggestion to management is to get enough servers and chefs. Even though I'm not happy at the moment I'm sure I'll still come back."}

This was (past tense) our favorite date night restaurant, as it used to be consistent and delicious. We hadn't been in over a year and it's clearly declined in quality. 
We ordered the center cut sirloins, neither were cooked properly and both of us had instant symptoms of food poisoning. The service was decent, but quality, and flavor were lacking. The Caesar salad and the bread was the best thing we had on this visit. Even their key lime pie was much smaller. Not worth the money. Time to find a new favorite. 

Update. Went in to redeem the scratcher and they refused to scratch it when it clearly states no purchase necessary. We won't be back. So unprofessional and ridiculous."}

It was about 2pm when we arrived. The hostess was on the phone and with a smile puts one finger in the air and puts her head back down. A manager comes behind her (she makes sure not to make eye contact with any of us) then turns around. Three other serves (who had nothing in their hands) walked right passed us. I said to myself "Hmmm... I hope the food isn't as bad as the hospitality." After standing and staring at the hostess for about six more minutes...we were seated.
Our server...forget her name...was genuine in her service. That's about all I can say. She forgot our Caesar salad (which is pretty bland) but the croûtons are ok. I ordered the Aspen Sirloin mid-rare. Texture reminded me of those stretchy hands n feet you used to get out of those little quarter machines back in the day and it tasted nothing like beef...straight salt. So I reordered the Filet Mignon. Now...I understand that it was on the fly...but there's no reason the center of the filet should be under 75degrees. NONE. The center was cold...I mean COLD.  By this point I'm starved and just ask for two minutes on each side. So the manager (yes the same from earlier) drops off my plate and it's clearly obvious she hates her job and shouldn't be there...especially in a management capacity. So after getting my medium steak back...it was wrapped with a nasty, slimy attempt at bacon. I'd give the steak itself (everything else aside) a 4.5.
I ask for a glass of malbec and the waitress looks at me with this perplexed look and goes..."Ummm...what's that?". LMFAO!!! I'm sorry you're in steakhouse and the waiter doesn't know a red wine when she hears it???? 
So after its all said and done my bill is presented. No GC, no taking care of my daughters plate, glass of wine...nothing. I'm NOT a moocher! By Any means. But being in the industry...I KNOW I WOULD NEVER EVER place an untouched bill in front of my guests who had the experience I had. Even if offered, I would have probably turned it down...but it's the principle. Show that you value your guests...they don't.
Pitiful management going on there. Nothing special about the place.

If you love commercial food, and don't really care about wasting your dollar...then this place is perfect for you. OH..in there defense the Salmon my wife ordered was pretty darn good and the sauce was well made. Hence the 2nd star. Had it not been for that, and like I said our genuine server (whom I left $20 on an $84 lunch)...I would take away a couple stars. NEVER going back."}

The servers were fast and the chefs are so energetic and funny that they will create a laughter riot throughout the cooking session. The food is cooked in front of you so you know exactly what goes into your stomach. 

I am a vegetarian so I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING DIFFERENT SPATULAS FOR VEGETARIANS which is not the case. Just one used for anything and everything from prawns to tofus.  

My husband is a lover of the chicken fried rice which he says is a must try.
Quantify is very very minimal for the meal portions so be prepared for a huge bill.
The meal comes with a complimentary ice cream and a birthday song sung by all the servers.

Overall a good experience and a must try place but with a lot of flaws."}

But not much more than that.  What got me a bit perturbed was that the whole attitude here reeks of some giant corporate machine (and how are we doing today, sir?  and how are we enjoying our meal sir?)  Everything was very expensive, too, and that knocks them down another notch.

A group of 6 of us arrived during happy hour, and had a wait of 20 minutes.  Not bad, and they were true to their word.  We bellied up to the bar and were informed that drinks were $5 (or was it $7) but only well drinks were that price.  Four martinis cost over $40.  Now I'm prepared to pay that in a big city, but this is suburban Chandler.  And it was happy hour!  Who drinks a vodka martini in a supposedly nice restaurant with well vodka?  Arrghhh, I am ranting now.

I had a salad and a steak.  The steak was a little overdone but tasty.  But then again, you can't screw up a ribeye too badly.  Nor a salad.  I can't even remember my side, I think it was mashed potatoes, and they tasted like, well, plain mashed potatoes.

Great decor, but I won't be back to see it again."}

It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P. 

Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. 

Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. 

Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. 

As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. 

At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. 

They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch. 

For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night."}

The aged rib-eye, comes in three sizes (I got the 14 ounce)--have it cooked rare to medium rare. Any more done than this I think is overcooking a perfectly fine steak. The 14-ounce ribeye was $26+

So, for the food I think it deserves a 4+
And for the atmosphere, a 5 easily. It's very nice and inviting inside, and none of that snooty ambiance and attitude that I have come to associate with some high-end steak restaurants that I've been to. Besides, there's A Nordstrom in the same area, as well as an Ethan Allen across from the restaurant.

I am not sure if the Firebirds is a chain and if it is, that would be my only quibble since I would very much prefer to go to smaller and local places. 

All in all, my hubby and I had a very pleasurable dinner here, and we would go back for the ribeyes, of course!"}

We decided to try it out last Tuesday night. Unfortunately, we didn't even make it past the hostess before the experience turned negative.

It started with the front hostess who was truly @!T%#. She had to be the most disrespectful and rudest person I've ever encountered in the restaurant business. Her attitude and demeanor reflected poorly on the restaurant and if I was Benihana corporate, I'd sue her for representing my company so badly.

My family and I immediately walked out and I proceeded to call the manager from my cell phone. The person who answered the phone claimed to be the manager and apologized to no end about the poor treatment we received. She took my name & number down and promised to call me back the next day in order to get my mailing address because she promised a gift certificate in response to the issue. Its been 3 days since we visited this location and still no phone call from that manager.

I am making it a point to contact their corporate office to advise them about how this location operates."}

Love all the sauces that come with the teppanyaki. Love the humor. Our chef at this location even made a 'Mickey Mouse' out of the rice, per my daughters request, just one of the highlights. 

I don't understand the negative comments or reviews regarding waiting to be seated unless the entire party is there, or sharing a table at teppanyaki. This is common practice at all locations I've ever been to. 

I have learned this particular location is busier on the weekends, so I just call for reservation. If I need one great, if I don't, then I'm happy I checked. I have been during the week and reservations weren't needed, so it just depends.

I love their ginger dressing, it's not like anything I've ever had. Over the years I have even purchased it. I am a fan of shrimp and this restaurant has my favorite shrimp. 

Our family will continue to come to Benihana's, as we have for many, many years. This is one of our favorite places to eat."}

That was two years ago. Recently we have tried 4 times and each time they quoted us over a hours wait. So tonight we went here knowing it may be a hours wait so we got there at 4:55 pm. They open for dinner at 5. When we walked in the place was empty and they still quoted us a hour. We waited the full hour in the bar ($57.00 for two MaiTai and 2 house wines). After the hour was up we asked how long the wait was and they said "your Edward right?" I replied no John and that is when they let me know they dropped us off the list. They did not know why we were no longer on the list. The only thing they could say was " we don't know why this happens but it will now be another 35 to 45 min. I had let them know my whole party was there at 5 and we would wait the full hour in the bar. 

Needless to say I'm done trying this location. I also saw 4 other parties leave as soon as they walked in and got such a long wait time quote. All of this happened when the restaurant was 65 to 75% empty!!!

Fire the hosts or manager ASAP. It really seems like the host was doing everything to keep people from filling up the restaurant."}

The sushi always taste fresh and delicious. It was my first time getting the Hibachi steak  and lobster, both had a lot of flavor. It's  seasoned with butter, salt, pepper, and Japanese butter.

We love the Arrowhead location, and expected this location to be up to standard. 

   Service was good. Other than the table not being completely prebussed/crumbed, no major complaints. Our drinks were always full and food came in a timely manner. 

  All 5 of our filet mignon were underdone. The medium rare steaks came out rare, and my medium steak came out medium rare. We aren't sending back 5 steaks. Ive been in the industry for 9 years, I'd rather eat an underdone steak than send it back. 

  I start to get into my steak, and I realize that it is unbelievably charred, which I normally don't mind. Im pretty used to eating burned food, considering my cooking skills. The char is so bad that I can't taste the steak at all. I am pretty sure there was no salt put on the steak before it was cooked.

  The steak had me puzzled. About 5 bites in I realize that it isn't filet mignon. My suspicion is validated when I steal a bite of my boyfriends steak. Everyone else's filet is wrapped in bacon, mine is not. 

  I had to be at work later that day, and was already short on time. I did not have the option to wait for another steak to be cooked. Also did not want to cause a scene in front of my boyfriends parents. As someone who will do whatever possible to avoid sending anything back, I would have sent back this steak if I had the time to. 

  Also, several of the Au Gratin potatoes in the mix were still raw. Super unpleasant to be picking raw potatoes out of a mouth full of chewed food. Also super unpleasant to eat said raw potatoes.

  I don't eat fish, so I can't tell you how the ahi was.  (Ahi? Mahi? Not even sure if I'm saying it right) However, I overheard my boyfriends dad saying he liked the salad better than the fish. No ahi went uneaten though!

  The creme brulee cheesecake is great as always. Having worked at several bars/restaurants, I did find it odd that they did not have one of the desserts comp'ed for a birthday. 

  When presented the bill, I noticed that I was charged for the 9oz filet that I ordered but instead got something of lower quality and price. My boyfriend was super pissed, and told me to tell our server to charge me for what I was given (probably a sirloin, no salt/pepper, extra char lol). I could tell it caught our server off guard since everything seemed fine. She ended up comping the entire steak. Which was cool of her, because even though I do like sirloin nornally, this steak was SO bad. 

  Overall, service was great, food was terrible. I would not go back here. It was kind of embarrassing since we talked up the place so much. The whole time I was wishing they came to our side of town and had dinner at "our" firebirds (Arrowhead)"}

My mom ordered the prime rib with a baked potato and I ordered the sirloin with mashed potatoes and we both got a green salad. Her prime rib was cooked medium well and my sirloin was cooked medium. My steak was burnt on the outside and really pink on the inside. It didn't taste too bad but it was hard to chew as it wasn't very tender. For the price of the food I at least expected it to come with 2 sides but you only get one and you can add more for a not so good price. After we were done spending our $69 plus tip on mediocre food and drinks we went home and we both started to feel sick. So we went to bed. The next day aka today we both had upset stomachs, the chills, and nausea. I have been throwing up and have been in and out of the bathroom all day. I have a headache and I am weak. I think it's safe to say we got food poisoning. Next time I will get a decent steak/meal at a good price at Texas Roadhouse. I'm mad that I spent $80 just to get sick off of this food.

I signed up for their birthday club, and received a voucher for $30 towards a birthday meal.  That's pretty huge, and I'm very grateful.

But I have to calls em like I sees em.

Let's start at the beginning.  The salad had a bit too much dressing on it.  Check out my photo of what was left at the bottom of my salad bowl and see for yourself.  I think the folks over at The Sushi Room have got a good grasp on salad dressing.

The caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls were fantastic tasting and a good size.  This would be a great place for HH.

I came here with my daughter.  We both wanted Chicken Yakisoba.  She ordered off of the lunch menu (around $8), and I ordered off the dinner menu (around $18) since I had the $30 credit.  Imaging my surprise when the waitress brought out two places of equal portions.  Where did the extra $10 go?  Oh yes, I did get a soup with my entree.

Their yakisoba was just ok.  The chicken was a bit dry and the noodles had a taste I was not accustomed to.  Not terrible, but not a dish I'll be returning for anytime soon.

When we were done, the waitress brought individually wrapped hand towels, something I would expect at a BBQ joint.  But Wow!!!  These hand towels are awesome.  So big and thick.  I wish Buffalo Wild Wings would give you these kind of hand towels, instead of the little thin ones that burn your hands and smell of lemon.

For dessert, a large scoop of green tea ice cream, and a fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  Both were excellent.  I would order these again.

And to top it off, the manager sauntered over to where we were seated and asked if we would like our picture taken.  I affirmed, and assumed a lean-over-the-table pose.  No more than two minutes later, he returned with a nicely framed picture of my birthday guests.  Superb!  100% impressed.

Once again, thank you Benihana for making an otherwise normal birthday meal, special.  I'll be back for HH and desserts."}

With all the talk, I expected the great show of food preparation, but I had an expectation that the food would be tasty. I felt it was very mediocre. The food didn't have much flavor and lacked salt. Of course, there is no salt on the table.  My favorite part of steak anywhere is the steak sauce. They have no steak sauce. None. Period. Finally they serve Pepsi products and I'm a Coke fan. Just wasn't at all what I expected. The chef was fun, entertaining and funny, but we just paid $175 for four people to have dinner!"}

Even if Arizona's Benihana's doesn't resemble the authenticism of those in San Francisco.  The cooks in Arizona are generally NOT asian, which really is my only disappointment with these local restaurants. It just gives it another feel.

However, the food is great, the atmosphere is nice.

Just some advise:

The tables sit 8 people.  Try to go with a large group or you will get stuck with several strangers (loud, obnoxious and drunk perhaps?).  It's not really a romantic setting in those conditions.  

Also, allow over 2 hrs for dinner.  We got there at 6:30 and left at 8pm (we made it just in time for our movie at 8:25pm).  

I will go again, next time, with a larger group."}

There were six of us, and another couple was seated at our table. One of my gripes with this style of cooking, is that the dining space is super tiny. With all of our drinks (one each) at the table, there was hardly any room for error. Either way, our server was super nice and took very good care of us.

Waited in the line for around 10 minutes and my name is called. I have been asked to sit at a teppanyaki table, together with another 2 groups of people (one with 4 and another with 2). 

Teppanyaki is not my choice for tonight, I just want to have my Sashimi. I ordered the Sashimi Combination with Rice after ordering the drinks and waited for quite some time. Finally, the drink is served and the food come next. 

First, it is the Miso Soup. Just a very normal one. Next is the Salad. Nothing to shout about. I started to eat and the rest of the 6 people, talking and having their drinks, while seeing me eat. 

Finally, comes my Sashimi. Yummy. There are 5 types of Sashimi. Each has 3 slices. Nice!

Just before I finished the dinner, the chef came and started to cook for the rest of the people. 

Some notes I want to mention here:
1. The lady at the table is very annoying. I wish I can sit at another table rather than the teppanyaki table.
2. I think the staff should have asked before serving the customers to the table whether teppanyaki or not teppanyaki. Or maybe they only have teppanyaki table? No idea.
3. The waiting time is quite long for the waitress to come taking the  order. For those who ordered the teppanyaki, make sure you are not very hungry at that time.

Overall, the food is good. If not because of the annoying lady and the waiting time, I would give it a 4 star instead of 3. The lady is really spoiling my dinner mood."}

I had the Kobe meatloaf which was flavorful and light the Parmesan mashed potatoes and green beans were delicious. my husband had prime rib and said it was outstanding. our friends had center cut sirloin and there wasn't a piece left on their plates. highly recommend you try this restaurant."}

We walked in at 3 pm on a Saturday so the place was not busy, and we were ignored by all 3 people standing at the host stand. When they finally decided to greet us, we were sat at the bar as we had requested. Everything went downhill from there. The bartender, "DelBetty" as she was named on the receipt was less than pleasant. She deliberately ignored us for a few minutes before greeting us by saying "are you waiting for a table"? We were the only people in the bar, so you would think she would have been happy to have some customers. Her attitude and lack of personality couldn't have pushed us out sooner. To top it off the food sucked too. BYE Benihana.

This visit,however, was just "off". I am still giving it 4 stars because I believe that mistakes happen and sometimes restaurants have an off night. 

We went to Firebirds to celebrate Mother's Day. It wasn't an incredibly busy night which surprised me. There were 6 people in our party. We were seated a little ahead of our reservation time which was nice. When we got to our table, I noticed all kinds of food and dirty linens underneath the table. They did bus the table but never bothered to look down. We ordered drinks and had to ask for straws...all of us. I asked and she gave me one but didn't bother to give any to the rest of my party. Then my mom asked and she still only gave one...I thought that was weird. Is this a new rule to only give straws to the people who ask?

We ordered our meals after some time and salads were brought promptly. We were advised that bread was in the oven but shortly thereafter, I noticed others getting bread so we needed to ask again. After receiving our salads, all of us needed more salad dressing. That has never happened before. I normally love the mixed green salads but they just weren't great this time. I'd think it is pretty hard to not get that right...

Our main courses arrived in a good amount of time and right away I had to send mine back. I ordered the special filet medallions with lobster meat with hollandaise on the side. Of course, it came slathered in hollandaise. The server knew it too and realized it the minute I looked at it. Everyone else's food came and all else was as it should be. I received my food about 5 minutes after everyone else which was ok. Manager came over and apologized but that was it. 

I am not sure what was going on last night and I am hoping it was just a fluke. The regular manager that we normally see there wasn't there and I am wondering if that's why things were off. Either way, we will be back...as I said, I normally love Firebirds so I am willing to give it another go."}

We took our family to celebrate a birthday (which it appears everyone does this as we heard the birthday song screamed about the restaurant through the entire evening) and were seated with another couple (they do their best to fill all seats around the grill). Our 6-year old daughter LOVED the "performance" - the onion volcano of fire being her favorite part. And she tried everything, which was really cool to see! Our server was a little bit impatient or short with us, not saying more than a few words- but she was attentive and always made sure our water glasses were kept full along with our alcohol orders. 

It's fun watching the "show" as your food is cooked in front of you. Our chef had a good personality and chatted through the evening, making small talk and cracking jokes while he prepared our orders. The table ordered shrimp, filet, and chicken with fried rice (you gotta get the fried rice) so we all had plenty to eat. I believe most meals are served in five courses. You'll start off with a Japanese onion soup, move to a ginger dressed salad, then on to fried rice, the main course (protein with grilled vegetables) and finally served a scoop of ice cream. It's a lot of food but your given plenty of time to enjoy it. Between the ordering, setup, show, and eating prepare for a 2+ hour experience. But again, it's fun and the entertainment is what you are paying for. The food is obviously fresh since it's cooked right in front of you, but you are limited to your options outside of the protein.

Our party of five, with drinks, ran about $300 with tip so it's not a cheap meal. Benihana is one of those "every 5 years on a special occasion" kind of places. See you in another five years!"}

I know it can be a lengthy dining process however our table was fairly swift with ordering and getting organized etc, although the staff and chef were NOT. Our 1.5 hour expected dinner (post seating) turned into a 2.5 affair--even after the doors closed. The waitress visited us every half hour--not a good look. The chef overcooked the shrimp appetizer, the colossal shrimp, and my filet. Not to mention another customer requested a ton of extra seasoning which the chef felt compelled to add to my filet. So not only was their pricy filet overcooked and brittle with every bite but overseasoned, not per my request. 

Once everything was done, the first items were ice cold, which is sometimes common but didn't help their case tonight. If the chef had cooked (like the chef we saw at the table next to us) and stopped talking and joking the entire time, we may have had some well prepared and warm/hot meals. The chef made an inappropriate joke or two. Bashed a previous customer about their eating preferences and also for some reason thought it was appropriate to ask my guest why they are vegetarian. This put an already uncertain first timer on the spot and was, to be quite frank, none of the chef's business. If they cared about why people have certain eating preferences, go ask your friends or someone on the street. Don't put customers on the spot for ordering items off of your company's menu...??!? I've noticed the chefs at this location take the friendliness to another level and become TOO familiar and playful with guests--this not only can make other customers uncomfortable but can be inappropriate and obviously unnecessary. 

Overall--Just a ruined birthday experience. Even if I got another $30 certificate (which was a waste this time around) I won't be back to this location and probably not others. Also done promoting/recommending this chain to friends."}

My grandson had the kids ribs (they say half rack, but sure looked like a full rack to me), steak fries, fresh fruit, lemonade and an oreo cookie ($8.95). We both enjoyed the hot sourdough bread and butter. The food and service were terrific. We both had to take about half of our food home since the portion size was so large.

The food was ok, not very flavorful.  I had the filet mignon and shrimp, both we're good, but a little on the bland side.  I was surprised to learn that the meal came with steamed rice, and if we wanted fried rice it was an extra 3.50 per person.

The price was the same!

The shrimp appetizer was a nice touch & we enjoyed it very much. Then came the steam rice, but wait!, we had not been service any of the main entree. By the time we had, the rice was cold. They could solve this by either waiting to serve the rice fresh or serve it with a lid on it. Our Chef's name was Nico & we were the 3rd. table he had ever cooked for and it showed. I ordered the steak & lobster. He cooked up a bunch of steaks, when I noticed that they were being cooked well. He then served me the steak. I informed him that I ordered medium rare. He smiled & giggled & then acted like he did not understand me. My wife tried to let our waitress know, but she walked off, because she said she had to take care of the table next to us. I grudgely ate it, as I did not want to upset the table, due to 2 other birthdays were also being celebrated.

When Tania, our waitress came by at the end, she asked how everything was & my wife explained that for $37.00 for a steak & lobster, I should at least get it cooked the way I ordered it. She apologized & asked if she should get a manager. We said yes. Well she came back 10 minutes later with the bill & then ran off again.

We sat outside and it was warm, the low top seats however were pretty uncomfortable. There were no high top tables available so we made due and I really didn't even mind it too much.

Our server was Nadine and she was so sweet, always making sure we had everything we needed. We started with the Lobster Queso dip and Oh. My. Gosh. It will literally change your entire life, because it did mine! The chips were a little salty, so ask for no salt if you're not into it, but I still ate every single one. 

My mom and I both ordered the steak salad and my dad ordered the pork Mac and cheese (??) I can't remember exactly what it's called but it was pork in Mac n cheese. You'd think it wouldn't be very good but it was actually delicious! Our steak salads were so good, perfect amount of dressing and fixings. 

We were stuffed but decided to get cheesecake Togo. We got the creme brûlée cheesecake and woah, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself but was forced to share with my parents (aw man). 

All in all it was great food, great atmosphere, great service! If they had one in Washington I'd be a regular, but I'll always definitely choose Firebirds when in Arizona!"}

As for the wait, we made a reservation at 8pm, got there at 7:55 and still waited about 30 mins, so that was disappointing. What was the point in a reservation, to prevent an hr wait?? Plus it was Tuesday, not a huge outing night. 

Now the food on the other hand is not as great as I was expecting. This was my first time at Benihana and with the huge reputation and high food cost; I was really expecting the food to be better. It lacked seasoning and was mostly bland so needless to say it fell below my expectation and I failed to understand what the hype is about. Could've just been me and my families singular experience but that's my opinion.  Great fun, average food."}

They are very consistent - the food is well prepared, cooked to your specifications, and seasoned properly.  

This weekend, we took a friend out for some Birthday steaks.  The meal started with bread, which was tasty and warm out of the oven.  We didn't get any appetizers this time, but have gotten both the Ranch Rings and the Potato Skins in the past - both are fantastic.  

Three of us ordered the same thing - the sirloin steak, which is a lot of meat for less than $20.  One of us got it well, another medium, and I got it medium rare.  They were all cooked properly and given to the right person - no trading!  The steak was flavorful and tender, and served with an excellent baked potato.  This is a throwaway side at many restaurants, but not here - the outside is salted, it's not microwaved, and it's loaded with quality cheese and bacon.  Delicious!  

The other people in our party ordered the Chicken BLT salad and the Strawberry Goat Cheese salad and enjoyed them.  Firebirds does not skimp with the toppings - they're fresh and plentiful.  The goat cheese is especially good.

We sat outside, because they have a nice patio with misters.  The only complaint about that would be the singer that was performing on the patio - she was pretty bad and too loud, but I can't blame the restaurant for that.

I only have one gripe that kept this from being a 5 star review - they took my favorite burger off the menu!  It had green chile and goat cheese... amazing.  Though the other burgers are good, nothing quite compares."}

My family and I wanted to celebrate my nieces birthday by taking her to one of her favorite restaurants "Benihana". I called 3 hours prior to our arrival to book our reservation of 11. We arrive promptly on time and the host informs me he cannot find our reservation. Skip ahead 20 minutes and the whole host staff was able to find the reservation but it had been canceled in error. The host that canceled it admitted fault but they had no available tables. Naturally, I argued that we shouldn't have to suffer due to their error. The host girl said "well, at least you don't have to wait an hour, be grateful." I was so appalled at the disrespect and awful customer service. Luckily we were able to find another establishment "Osaka Japanese" and they were able to seat us immediately and my niece had a great rest of her birthday. Please seek other restaurants other then Benihana."}

I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air.  So we decided to try Benihana's.  

Unfortunately, I think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and didn't tell a single joke.  His "performance" was boring, I think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat!  The food was very pricey, but the shrimp was tasty.  You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold.  They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats.  They need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls.

They also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out.  This just wasn't the experience I was hoping for."}

They kept telling me that the entire party had to be present and I reiterated that we would be a couple people short until the birthday girl arrived with her boyfriend. I had to get slightly rude with them and tell them that I had just received a text that the birthday girl was parking and we needed to be seated NOW. Once we finally got seated, the dinner was fun, delicious and entertaining, albeit over-priced for the amount that you get to eat. I also felt like we were rushed out of there after the grill was cleaned, but I will give Benihana 3 stars because I would recommend it to people who have never been before and don't mind spending $100 for 2 dinners and a couple drinks.

I ordered a cocktail red sangria and it was very smooth and I loved the bite size fruits I enjoyed after my drink. 

I was contemplating between the New York strip or the delmonico and I ended up ordering the delmonico medium well and it was so buttery and tender and juicy and I'm getting hungry again writing this post. 

The complimentary bread and butter is something so simple and what 95% of restaurants serve but they have a special kind of fresh warm sour dough complimentary bread. Absolutely amazing!

I was contacted by Firebirds and told upon request they would have sweet potato frys upon request. Though its been several months now... I went twice in the past two weeks and true to form.

It was overboard listening to there customers that make this place "AGAIN" our favorite steak house!!!  

We left several hundred bucks there Friday night so I guess it is wise to listen :)  If there was anything negative, it was my chocolate martini x 2 when I picked them up at the bar, I looked at the man who made them and smiled and raised my eyebrow as the pineapple tinies were full, opposed to the chocolate martini which was nearly 3/4 from the top ( the widest part ) and it looked obviously odd.

 He understood me without me having muttered a word he said thats a five oz martini glass and said if you think I am going to fill it, your wrong. Several guest sitting at the bar said dang!!  

Not the best response! 

But all in all everything else was great :)

The food and service was great !! We got the sweet potato fries the next day after church with our burgers !  YUM !!"}

We picked 4 or 5 sushi rolls off of the happy hour menu and had to repeat our order to her 3 times because she couldn't remember it and wouldn't write it down. She went into the kitchen, came back and asked is again which rolls we wanted. She came back with 3 sushi rolls and asked us which ones we were missing. We asked her which were the 3 she had just given to us and she didn't even know what they were. Went to ask the kitchen and sent the Manger out to talk to us like we were giving her a hard time. He of course couldn't help us because he obviously didn't kno what rolls we had, and didn't kno what we ordered because our waitress didn't write it down. 10 minutes later she brings out one more roll and doesn't say what it is and walks away. Never refilled our drinks. Didn't come back to check on us just dropped our tab as she walked by. Charged us for 6 sushi rolls and never came back.

Now let's get cracking on the food side... I ordered the hibachi chicken which I heard was great! So I was excited to start eating and thought maybe the food would out weigh the horrendous customer service, I was wrong. The onion soup was as if someone crumbled up a bag of funions and went to the local pond for the broth and just mixed It together. My chicken was absolutely flavorless and let's not forget chewy... I couldn't finish It. It was like the chef was focusing on his comedy routine more than making sure the Sam and Ella was cooked out of my chicken. I just wanted to leave as soon as we could, terrible experience and highly disappointed. (They also didn't offer any green tea at the end of dinner like they said they would on the menu)"}

Once we did, our lobster queso dip appetizer arrived fairly quickly, and to be honest was the highlight of the meal. Cheesy goodness with large chunks of lobster and spinach. I would recommend starting with it. Lunch itself was fairly uneventful. My turkey club was fine, but rather lackluster. The fact that it came on jalapeno bread was one of the reasons I ordered it, but the reality was it lacked in flavor and was a little dull. The co workers I ate with enjoyed their Durango burgers. I could go back if I was with someone who wanted to go, but this wouldn't necessarily be a pick for return visit from me. It seems popular, perhaps dinner is a better experience."}

The food is all over the board as far as quality goes. Sometimes you get a good mix and other times it is just OK. I've never had bad food at any teppanyaki restaurant, but don't expect the food to knock your socks off. This place is about the experience over the food.

The chefs are normally pretty good. If they hate their job, they they always put on a good face and put on a solid show for everyone. Good on them... or maybe I'm simply the only one that hates my job?

Is probably give this place a 3.5, but I can't do that here so I'll round up. OK food on the grill. OK sushi. Expensive (I got one roll and an adult beverage and it cost me 25) as all hell. Overall fun experience."}

Nice, relaxing atmosphere, wonderful decor.  Our server was Naomi and she provided great personable/fun service.  One thing I always watch is how the crew works.  The entire crew worked as team, including the management.  Very customer friendly restaurant.  I also really like, and prefer, going to restaurants with the open kitchens out in front of the customers.

I do not eat red meat, but there are menu items that I could chose from.  Since I am a big salad eater, there were some nice ones to chose from.  The menu did seem a little limited overall though.  This place is a definite must for the meat and potatoes eaters.

My son had the wood fired salmon special ($14), which was probably the best he has had here in the valley (I took a small taste and found it mouth watering good).  The mixed vegetable medley that came with the dinner, was cooked to the point of  just being soggy veggies.  Absolutely no nutritional value in them and not very good.  We left them on the plate.  Still enough food with the salmon piece and the mashed potatoes, that he was full, which is rare for him.

I had the spinach/mushroom salad ($11).  Interesting that the spinach was sliced up rather than served in it's leaflets.  Nice simple salad and very good delicious vinaigrette dressing.  Quite a bit, so I had lunch for the next day.

We will definitely be returning next time we have the opportunity to be in the southeast valley.  I look forward to trying something different on the menu.  When they get one up here in the North Scottsdale area, we will be regulars."}

He even suggested that he may come in a bit earlier to assist and help us decorate if I chose. We arrived and everything was ready to go. The servers were Lauren and Yvette. The food and service was fantastic. My son stated the service was "Seamless" As "perfect as service can be for a group our size" We dine here or take out several times each month and always have enjoyed. But this experience was above and beyond. The Firebird's staff allowed my wife and our family to absolutely enjoy our get together. I would without doubt highly recommend this restaurant for dining at a reasonable menu cost! Thanks Pedro, Lauren and Yvette and those behind the scenes. You made this a perfect birthday event."}

I do not think the patio area is all that great, but it is not bad either.

Not saying the food is bad, but I did not love it, or hate it. It was ok. Service was excellent though.

My second time dining here and I prefer the Keg which is close by in the same mall area in Chandler."}

Service was mediocre. Had to ask to have my iced tea refilled, not a huge deal but part of what I expect from good service. Had to wait 10 minutes for her to come pick up my check. 

I ordered the Sushi Deluxe meal which was 21.99. Came with some nigiri, tuna roll, soup, and salad. The miso soup was okay, nothing special, but I wasn't disappointed. Salad was really good, tasted fresh, good flavor on the dressing. The nigiri was terrible. Came with 8 different pieces. Some pieces almost tasted spoiled to me. Few things worse than gross sushi to me. The fish just looked cheap and sloppy. The tuna roll was the same thing, the quality of fish just ruined it. 

25 bucks on lunch isn't too common, so I expected a high quality lunch. Left with a bad fish taste in my mouth. Not cool bro"}

This is what I ate:

Sirloin on the wood grill with green beans. and a side of raw horseradish.  i basically licked my plate. It was one of the best steaks i've had in a LONG time. there were no imperfections on my cut of meat, i was able to eat every single bite of that 12 ounce beautiful hunk of cow. I mean, i wasn't able to eat for the rest of the day but so worth it. I didn't have to trim off any questionable pieces, every bite was perfection.

the flavors of the wood grill are very strong and pure bliss. and the seasoning made me sing. 

and the green beans were rock stars. although, i saw someone dipping the large steak fries in au jus and i got a little jealous that i didn't order fries but maybe next time. 

and i mean, if you think about it, since this is all i ate that day it averaged out to like $10 per meal if i pretend to divide it out and that's a steal!"}

Parlayed that $30 into the Benihana Delight and of course, the chicken fried rice. Ordered ice water and grand total with 18% tip was $6.36.
This can only be accomplished by using the solo dining option, therefore avoiding any female to bump up my tab. Oh yeah, this place will never get five stars unless they bring back the bean sprouts from the 90's. Lost another star due to that weird thing on the sides of colossal shrimp not being taken off properly. Had to peel those suckers off on my own. Huge bonus though for the chef keeping my steak on the grill until the last moment for well done status. I had to ask him twice not to take it off the grill, but I am probably one of a handful of people who would request this situation.
    Funniest part of night was when young dude spilled entire glass of water on another woman at the table, not in his party. Hard not to laugh. This Benihana is also pretty ugly and needs a remodel - it looks like it's been awhile.

   Oh yeah, the cute (but ditzy) blonde at the table had the best line. Chef puts some garlic Butter on the rice and calls it Japanese Peanut Butter and the girl (who didn't oder the rice) says, "i never had japanese peanut butter, wonder how it tastes""}

Came in without reservations and they were sat before us wow!!! Our waitress was new she was very friendly but rather slow as my husband said this is the first time we have sat down and a 1/2 later nothing in front of us so we opted out to preserve an appetizer.  Then the saving grace, Carlos come to cook our meals.  What a joy he was. So attentive, funny, friendly and just did a wonderful job having us all at the table so happy.

It's a four star "experience" with three star food and fun/interestig/good service. 

Food - It's fresh and nicely cooked but that's it. This is not a foodie restaurant. But if you are a foodie and you don't want to eat crappy food, this is a nice substitute. 

Service- Very congenial, prompt and FUN. We sat at a cook table, and why else would you go here? We were seated with a young couple who had two tiny kids who were rambunctious and loud. And again.. that's the kind of place this is. So be prepared to actually deal with other people. if you want quiet go somewhere else. 

Our cook chef was amazing. Really talented and charming. Made the experience wonderful. 

It's different and fun, with nice people, nice service and decent food."}

Like Rockfish, they have a great patio with a fireplace.  I've been a few times for a glass of wine, but the best time was on a cold rainy night.  Wine, a fireplace...who could ask for more.  

Well, one could ask for better food.  The food was okay...they have these yummy fries with blue cheese on them.  That was probably the best thing I had.  The three stars are mainly for the ambiance and wine...and the wine list isn't that great.  It's nothing more unique than you would find anywhere else.  And there are better places to go for steak, which is what my dining companion had.  

If you are down at the mall and just want food, and want something a little better than Chili's head on over.  If you are looking for a good meal that you will remember, go elsewhere."}

We asked Tania, our server to split our checks & she asked everyone if there was anything else we needed . We simply replied no because we were all stuffed . When it was time to pay, I handed her a coupon & she had an attitude and said " that's why I asked " but she didn't ask us anything about coupons she jst asked if we needed anything else . So I was very confused . She had an attitude but Ignored it and paid my bill . Upon leaving our server says to the birthday girl " happy early birthday!

It is always a fun time introducing new people to those type of restaurants. Benihana was my second choice, but Option A was closed. Being a chain, I knew I had a good shot it would still be in business. I prefer the smaller restaurants - typically more entertainment and lower cost, but Benihana is typically good and it is open.

There were 3 chefs working yesterday and we got the white guy. He was nice, but he wasn't as good as the ones at the other tables. This isn't him, because the other chefs didn't do it either, but there was no volcano like every other teppanyaki place does and no big flame to clean the grill. Probably being a chain they are more worried about law suits resulting from fire. Instead of volcano with flame, it was a train with smoke. 

Benihana is more expensive than other places, but considering it is like dinner and a show, it isn't bad. The show part was not as good as it could be. The chef was okay and for the first timers with me, they thought it was good. The flavor of the food was okay, but not the best I have had. It was just kind of ho-hum for me. Interestingly enough after he was finished with our table, the chef went to another table that was all Asian customers. I wondered to myself what they must think getting the one white guy in the place - then the loud clanking noise of him dropping the cart and the food on the ground told me they probably weren't impressed. 

For 2 people ordered one of the standard combos and water, it was $65 ($80 after tip). A little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food. I would recommend finding a smaller local establishment. At least they usually throw shrimp at you and douse you with saki if you catch it."}

I immediately began to be nervous because I couldn't remember my last visit, which probably meant that I stuffed it down deep into my subconscious never to be discussed again. Possibly.

Our reservation was for 5:45pm, but I arrived early to have some drinks with friends. I was greeted by the hostess who was friendly enough. I informed her that I had arrived early to have some drinks at the bar before being seated for dinner. She found my reservation, noted that I was here and welcomed us. 

We sat down at the bar and were immediately offered a drink. My friend and I were struck by the beautiful display of pineapple slices sitting in vodka. Very pretty and inspiring. We ordered their pineapple martinis. YUM! A little on the sweet side, but still very delicious and intoxicating. We sat and chatted for a while at the pretty bar. Our bartender was very friendly and unobtrusive. One thing that I did notice is that the hostesses were a little unprofessional. They were horsing around, giggling, and chatting loudly. A bit annoying, but they were young girls. After two of those yummy martinis, it was time for dinner.

Our party of 5 was seated at a round table in the center of the dining room. We were greeted by our server Brittany who took our drink orders and delivered water and lemons with speed. We informed her that we were there for the Phoenix Restaurant Week menu. She took the time to make recommendations off of the Restaurant Week menu and suggested wines to go with each of them.  Ahh my dinner...

I ordered the Espresso Rubbed Sirloin rare. The steak came with Potatoes Au Gratin. I was a little nervous ordering a sirloin steak because they tend to be a little tough due to the "cheapness" of the meat. I figured I was in a place that prides themselves on steaks and decided to give their "cheap" steak a shot. It's a good way to test a steakhouse. They should be able to make a shoe taste delicious.

When the meal was served, my rare (still moo'in) steak got served to someone else. So I sent my steak back for a rare one. I am SO glad that I sent it back for the steak I wanted. The steak was absolutely gorgeous and delicious. It was not tough at all! The rub that was on it was a little peppery for my taste but it's a personal preference for me. The Potatoes Au Gratin weren't good. They were a little too Velveeta for my taste. It would have been nice if they used some sharp cheddar or something like that instead. I ended up eating my friend's poblano mashed potatoes with my steak. Fantastic! The mashed potatoes were very spicy and went great with my savory steak! I hope they are a regular side. They're phenomenal! The dessert I chose was the Peaches and Cream Bread Pudding Cupcake with Bourbon White Chocolate Sauce. It seemed I chose the right dessert for the night because my other friends did not like the other choices for dessert at all. By the time I got my dessert, I was full, but the bites that I did take were delicious! It was a subtle peach flavor with a great sauce I wanted to eat the whole thing but my stomach just wouldn't do it. Brittany gladly wrapped everyones leftovers and put them in a to go bag. She was so quick and effiecient. Very impressive!

I am so glad I didn't dredge up any repressed memories of a horrible dining experience at Firebirds. In fact, the "mmm's and oooh's" that were being uttered were very familiar. It was nice getting reacquainted with such a great restaurant! I don't know why I didn't keep in touch, but I plan on going for regular visits from now on!"}

Our server got lost and never came back to take our order so we had to ask another for assistance.  The salad we ordered did not arrive until just before our burgers even though we had requested it be served first (right away) since it took so long to order.  They were overcooked but, we ate them anyway.  The best part was their fries but, that's not enough to make us drive 15 miles to pay the overinflated prices.  We won't be returning."}

I ordered three cheeseburgers and a large salad with steak and blue cheese to go 
My husband told me the restaurant covered the full bill that went over the 50 gift card amount just a little .. very sweet 
My salad was super delicious!! 
Oh my gosh , I could of eaten two of them !!

Great comeback

1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This place wavers between 3.5 and 4 stars, depending on who's doing the cooking.  In the world of teppanyaki, this place is definitely better than Kobe in Tempe, but it is not as good as Tanaka of Tokyo in Hawai'i (although the wait there, even with a reservation, can be ridiculous.)

My wife and I come here twice a year, every year, for our birthdays.  (Free $30 when you sign up for their e-club.)  Occasionally we'll bring a guest who wants to go.  The quality really does depend on the chef that day, so the quality can be uneven.

We don't come for the "show" anymore, seen too many.  But if you have kids, they will enjoy it.  You don't come for an amazing steak.  You come to get a decent sized meal and a serviceable steak for around $32.  We will say, the chicken fried rice is typically amazing, you just have to ask them to really go heavy on the garlic butter.

Even with a reservation, the most we've waited is 20 mins.  We've also been seated immediately, it all depends on where the chefs are at in their table rotation.  Service has been fine for us, though the staff typically looks like they're running around to cover all their tables.  

Like I said, you're not coming for a phenomenal meal, and without the free $30, I'm not sure I'd go so high as to give 4 stars, but as it stands, it's a decent steak and sides with great fried rice for a reasonable price."}

I did, last time I visited, try their onion ranch rings, which were tasty. Their brownie for dessert wasn't bad either. 

The decor is just a typical smokehouse/tavern feel. It's kind of dark in there except for in a few areas. The bar is large and it looks nice. They have a huge variety of liquor.

Overall, I'm not opposed to going to Firebird's but I probably won't go out of my way to choose it over some other places."}

It came out Medium or Medium well.  After my father-in-law told our waitress, the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered a free soup or salad.  He ordered the soup which the manager brought out instantly.  About 5 minutes or so later, the manager brought the new steak, apologizing for the delay and told us that the steak would now also be free because of the short delay.

Last evening we decided, on short notice, that we had not been here in a couple of months and  really wanted to go. Upon arrival we noticed that there were a few people waiting for a table, not unusual. We put our name in, told 45 min wait, and proceeded to bar. Discussing this it seemed a might bit long of a wait time considering this is a Tuesday night and really just a normal busy so they must of given us the " worst case" and would impress with faster seating. 
Needless to say this must have been best scenario as 1 hour later we were still waiting for a table. I went up to ask and was told " 15 to 17" minutes more. The hostess table and employees there were very unprofessional and incompetent as well. By the time we were seated my appetite was tepid as waiting that long will do that to you. Our table was sticky and needed to be wiped down or " sanitized for a second time". I ordered  the ribeye as a medium rare, it showed charcoal crisp on the sides, not a little due to cooking at high temp but seriously over done.

This review would be lower than the 2 stars except for the fact of a great bar staff that evening that showed both concern for our plight and professionalism. If i am going out again to drink I would consider this place. If I am looking for good service and food, I will go to The Keg!"}

We kept noticing people walking in after us being seated and we were just curious as to why they were getting seated and we haven't even been called upon. I gave them several minutes assuming since it was Mother's Day they might have just been a bit backed up. But once 6:30 hit I started to make my way to the desks and asked what was going on. The lady asked what my name was an she looks at her screen and leans to the other girl next to her and asked why hadn't we been seated yet. Needles to say they over looked my name and never called us, with that being said they squeezed other people in our place. So after we waited another while so they could find us a table, we didn't get seated till 6:40. Once we sat down we didn't see the waiter till 6:54 to ask us about drinks. I'm still here sitting patiently waiting on our drinks parched as can be. I guess we will see what happens next.

We went in for our anniversary so it had to be good.  First the greeters were actually friendly and accommodating.  We had our reservation but we were a bit late, so they had to wait to get a group together.  6 minutes.. not really bad wait.
Our waitress, Cheryl was great.  She was friendly, efficient and just all around on the ball.  Kept our table's drinks filled constantly and made sure we all had what was needed.  
The cook was Jeff.  He was fantastic. I am allergic to lemon and he remembered and cooked my food without while cooking everyone else's food.  He went overboard to give the birthday person at the table a pleasant experience.  The food was great.  Best tasting I have had in any Benihanas in a long time.  We travel a lot so we have been to a lot of them.  Can not say enough good about Jeff.
When we were looking for a specific mug Cheryl actually found not one but three (one for each of us) That is hard to do since this on we have not seen in very many places.  

The Bad:  IF you are not use to places like this the price could be a bit shocking.  BUT For all the food that we got and the quality, it was really worth it.  If you go in thinking you are getting cheap Japanese or Chinese food, go elsewhere because this is not that low quality.  

Summary:  We have been to a lot of Benihana and this one is one of the best.  Phoenix lucky to have this one.  We have only been to one other that equals this one and it was in California.  Food was great, service was great and friendly the place had a great atmosphere.  As stated, if you want cheap fast Oriental food, this is not the place, if you want a great dining and entertainment in this type of place this is where to go.  We will return more often and hope this was not one off great experience.

For those who thought the butter is Garlic Butter.. it is not.  They make (and everyplace else does also) Makes it out of HONEY BUTTER. If you want more Butter, just ask the Chef (at least this on did) for more butter to be added, same with all dishes with butter.  If one is early for a reservation, do not expect to be seated right away, they have to plan seatings.  Best thing to do (HINT) do not tell them you have a reservation UNTIL almost time for you reservation, thus you can maybe get seated better and then cancel you reservation, if you do not then you still have your time slot.  It is just polite to not demand you be seated ahead of your time.  If you have a meeting scheduled at work, and you go early, do not expect people to be there, if you leave because you were there and they were not they will still have the meeting at the scheduled time.

They used the same spices, or combination of spices, for nearly every dish that came out- salt, pepper, sesame seeds, lemon, soy sauce, garlic butter. Rinse, lather, repeat. I don't know if I could have tasted anything more boring. We got the chicken and shrimp dish for two, which was only about $32 which I'm thankful for now. If I spent any more, I would have been really sad.  My other friend ordered the fillet with teriyaki sauce instead of the garlic sauce, and while it was decent, it definitely wasn't worth the price tag. 

While the show was nice and the service good, the food was obviously overpriced and not tasty. They have a program where you sign up on their email list and get sent a $30 gift certificate during your birthday month. It's kind of sad when you go to a place and think the food is so boring that you wouldn't even come back for a free meal on your birthday."}

Initially we had gone on, I believe, a Tuesday evening and it was pretty packed so we opted to make reservation for the next day and just come back. Off the bat, the seating is NOT my cup of tea. I understand it's communal because they cook in front of you on those big grill tables which can fit a ton of people but I am not outgoing at all and if you get the wrong table neighbors, you're in for a world of uncomfortable small talk. We were sat next to a very nice family who was also celebrating a birthday and I could just tell the wife wanted us to be more engaging but sis, we weren't even here for that kind of party. Our waitress was super sweet; I wish I could remember her name because she was on it. Our chef was funny too, he wasn't showing off as much as some of the chefs around us but I get it, he's just a laid back kind of guy. Everyone stressed to me how good the fried rice would be and how it was worth the upcharge and while I do agree it was worth the upcharge, it really was just basic chicken fried rice. If I recall correctly, I got the Benihana special and my husband got the hibachi steak. The cook on the steaks and the lobster was definitely over and everything was so salty, too too much soy sauce. It was just a miss for us. My husband said he's glad we tried it but he does not want to go back but I think I'd go back for Happy Hour or maybe treat my younger brother for his birthday since it's a fun experience. I think I'll probably try a different location next time."}

It's a bit spendy, but not the most expensive steakhouse in the area. I promptly signed up for the email club and even though I got the birthday coupon for $10 off the night before my birthday, it still read, "happy belated birthday." I gave it to the waitress and told her it's actually my birthday today, but she still kept saying "belated birthday" lol. So as for the experience and the food... We went without a reservation and got a table as a party of two in less than 5 minutes. It's dimly lit and looks to be more of a casual dress place. The panella bread with butter was delicious! Sure, it's not the soft rolls with honey butter from another steakhouse (my husband likes those better), but I think it's just as tasty! My prime rib was soooo good and the au jus was salted perfectly. I opted for a baked potato and sautéed spinach as my sides.  The prime rib comes with a potato already, but it's $6 for any additional side. I probably had enough to eat, but really wanted a vegetable (even if it was coated in oil and topped with cheese). The food and service were great and I even learned of a food I've never tried. Jicama. We thought they were onions and picked them out of the salad lol."}

I do not get excited quickly.  I am very humble and understand that things happen.  

This was our first visit here on Friday.  We had a couple of gift cards from a family friend.  We made the reservations for 6 pm.  We got here in time.  I parked the car while the better half checked in.  She was seated already when I got in.  

We ordered the cheese crisp for a appetizer.  I did not like it at first.  Then after a couple more bites the flavours came together and it was really good.  I liked it and will get this again.  

My dinner was the salmon with mashed potatoes and it was good.  The salmon was tasty and the potatoes were yummy.  I ordered a side of shrimp too and they were yummy. 

My better half ordered the filet medium.  It came out and she cut it and it was more on the medium rare side.  The server was there and we told him.  They rushed it back.  The one manager brought it back and they tried to sear it.  In doing so they charred the outside pretty bad.  Then the server and other manager came and apologized for it.  They offered to make another one, but she was fine.  In doing so they took care of the meal for us.  I was expecting to pay for my salmon dish since it was prepared right.  I insisted on paying but the manager would not hear of it.  They gave us a couple of gift cards which was good and unexpected.  We did leave the server a 20 dollar tip too.  

I really do not get excited when stuff like that happens.  I work in the construction industry and tell you fubar happens all the time.  To me and with the wild life I have lived.  If we get a bad meal once in a while who cares.  The staff at this place did a great job.  I was willing to pay for the appetizer and salmon dish, but they took care of it. We will come back for sure."}

There was a pretty good size bar inside the entrance with a large dining room with tables and large spacious booths about. Large windows allow for gazing out towards the palm trees and mall parking lot offering a wide array of shopping options before or after dining. The service was as expected. Timely and attentive. Granted it wasn't busy so I couldn't assess a true service level when it was slow. The menu offered a variety of steak and seafood options. Along with salads, sandwiches, and burgers. Great flavors and quality food albeit I believe to be a chain. Overall, nice place to go that's not fine dining and a place that you can remain casual with a relaxing atmosphere."}

Firebirds is a great option for steak dinner. It's on par with other Chandler steak houses (The Keg, Chop) in terms of quality, but at a better price. I brought my family (a group of 7 adults total) this past weekend and had a great time. My father and sister are not big steak eaters and both got fish based dishes and both were very happy. 

Because we had a larger group, I made sure to call ahead and make a reservation. They have a nice feature that send you a text with your reservation time. It also offers  the ability to cancel the reservation by text back. Once you get to the restaurant, they use the text based system as an alternative to a paging device. Nice touch. 

Food: Don't come here expecting a Maestros or Morton's type experience. This isn't that level of steakhouse. It is, however, a great option in the lower price range. Pretty sure every steak dinner was under $30. Quality is greater than Outback for not much more. 

Service: From the hostess to management, I was really impressed. Our table wasn't quite ready at 7:30 (our reserved time), but they did a nice job communicating that with us and our group didn't feel ignored. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our waitress certainly seemed to be new, but she was still able to get my answers and make the necessary adjustments. My wife ordered her filet medium-rare and received a steak that was medium-well. She's not one to complain, but I knew she wouldn't enjoy this so we asked if they could make her another one correctly. The manager working that night, Pedro I believe, not only came over to apologize but grabbed her plate and made sure himself that the steak was properly prepared this time. It was a very busy Friday night, so it's nice to see he cared that much. He also removed her meal from the bill, which was totally unnecessary, but still appreciated. When her second steak arrived medium-rare, my wife very much enjoyed it. 

I don't expect a restaurant to be perfect in order to get a 5 star review. I do, however, expect them to make things right if they make a mistake. Firebirds did that and more. We will be back soon."}

Top notch experience throughout the night.  Over the years, we always get the same lady trying to upsell all the food and drinks.  I always go with the mojito (two or three) followed by a Kirin.  Yum Yum.  

I had the filet mignon and shrimp. Awesome.

The best part, of course, is the chef.  Here, it's either hit or miss.  One year we got a Mexican woman and it just wasn't the same.  This year, we had Chu and he was excellent. (Though he told us how to say I Love You in Japanese and I pointed out that it was Chinese - he was a little surprised :-)

Also, my 6 year old came up to me during dinner and whispered, "mommy, if you made salad like this I would eat it every night."  Quick, get me the recipe!!!!

Something I've always wondered is whether you're supposed to tip the chef, so I asked on the way out.  The manager told me that the chef and waitress split the tip 50/50 but the chef always appreciates something extra.

I always feel it's a little over priced because the food itself is pretty boring but you are paying more money since the chef puts on a show for you. It can be a fun experience if you are with the right people and in the mood for it but I have never really been wowed by a meal at one of these places. Our last experience at a teppanyaki place up in Flagstaff was so awful that I was not really looking forward to our dinner at Benihana but we had received a gift card for Christmas so we decided to go ahead and give them a try.

Style wise, the place is on par with the other restaurants around Chandler mall. Nice looking but somewhat trite Asian decor. Not surprisingly, they were quite busy on a Saturday night and we had to wait at the bar a little while for a table. While we were sitting there, I observed that there were a surprisingly amount of families there. I would have thought that this was not type of place you would bring kids, partially because of the hibachi grill and also the price. But there were a ton of kids of all ages. Most of the families were on their way out, though, and the late night crowd was arriving. This seems to be a popular date spot for college age couples. There was a good lively crowd in the bar area so we didn't really get a whole lot of attention from the bartender... they definitely need to staff up behind the bar. Since I found the wine and beer list very lacking, I decided to try a couple of their specialty cocktails. These were mediocre at best. The Cucumber Collins had a good, fresh flavor to it and was pretty enjoyable but it could have done with a little more lemon and less club soda. I decided to switch to something stronger and so made the mistake of ordering a Beni-Tini. This drink was overly sweet and not enjoyable at all. I could not detect any hibiscus flavor so I have to assume that they use a syrup rather than brewed tea. If you like sweet drinks this may work for you but I guess I should have just ordered a regular martini. I did notice they had some top shelf (well, mid-shelf anyway) liquor bottles so next time I'll just stick to the basics.

Once we were finally seated, my hubby and I had no complaints about our chef or the food. The mushroom soup was tasty, though it took me by surprise since most restaurants like this serve Miso Soup as a starter. I also really enjoyed the salad; it had plenty of other vegetables, not just lettuce, and the dressing was really good. The hubby got a surf and turf thing with steak and jumbo shrimp. I tried one of his shrimp and they were very sweet and delicious, much better than the smaller ones we all got included with our meals. (Those were cooked well, but just inferior quality shrimp). For my entree, I ordered a noodle dish, Seafood Diablo. This was not as spicy as I was hoping and the sauce was a bit too greasy for me (lots of oil on my plate when I was done) but overall it was good. The seafood all tasted delicious and I was actually amazed that chef managed to make sure that the squid, shrimp, etc in my dish didn't get overcooked while at the same time tending to everyone else's chicken and steak. We ended the meal with the fried banana dessert with vanilla ice cream and a scoop of chocolate on the side for me. We were both pretty happy with that!

Overall, this is not the best teppanyaki place I've been to but it is far from the worst. I would probably eat here again if I was with a group who picked it but I wouldn't necessarily suggest it myself."}

My in-laws took me there for my birthday--seriously does anyone go to Benihana for anything other than their birthday? The food was great and our chef, Jeremy, put on a great show though I did notice some of the other teppanyaki cooks were a bit more animated.

The onion soup, salad and shrimp appetizer were as good as ever and the signature Mai Tai in a Buddha mug was delicious. I ordered the Splash 'N Meadow and asked for my meat to be cooked medium rare. It was the perfect texture and temperature. The shrimp were great, too. My husband had the mango shrimp and really liked them though he did mention the sauce was a bit sweeter than he'd anticipated. 

The staff was really great and made sure we all had constant refills. Our server was very attentive and helpful when ordering. Go here for your next birthday but make sure you go online and get the free birthday coupon first."}

The bread is pretty amazing but I've gone to cheaper places that have had just as good bread. 
Once our plates arrived the food was good but we didnt have very much food on our plates. I was very disappointed by the $$$ to amount of food we were getting. In addition to the food, it was VERY loud and I think a lot of it comes from the kitchen being right off of the dining room. 
All in all we will not be returning and we recommend you spend your money at Abuelos across the street. (Chandler Mall)"}

We had the chicken and steak meal and the shrimp and steak meal. And it was all cooked perfectly. This place is not super cheap so make sure it's a good celebratory occasion to make it worth while.

Came to check out Benihana's happy hour and sat at the bar.  One bartender was more eager than the other to answer my questions regarding my food issues, but both were gracious and friendly.  I wondered if they split the tips evenly?

Tried a few plates...  Some were 50% off, and some were slightly reduced.  The menu pricing was a little confusing, and I hope that this is corrected in the near future.

The seaweed salad was OK.  Don't know if I would pay the full price of $3.75, though.  (And for 50%, or was it $3?, I don't think it was worth that, either.)  The gyoza was also just OK- a bit on the bland side and a bit lacking on the mouth-feel aspect.  The asparagus tempura plate was a nice surprise; However, the greasiness got to me, and in the end, I was stripping the batter off of the spears more due to necessity, and not w/ the sadness I normally would be feeling from having to trim off delightful cruchiness, bec. otherwise I couldn't enjoy the meal knowing I'd ingested all of that excess oil!  The tuna sashimi was very good and substantial, compared to all of the "light" apps that I tasted before it.  The spicy yellowtail was also very nice, although the jalapenos were a bit too much, so I just scooped them off to the side.  Really liked the acidic component of this dish!  With all the HH reductions, I wasn't thrilled w/ this meal, but at least I know which to revisit and which to pass next time.

Lunch was also a bit disappointing.  Both lunch boat and duet came w/ many components, but Mom and I only truly enjoyed the salad, the chicken (it was good, although I couldn't eat much of it), the salmon sashimi, and the runaway hit, beef julienne (both off of the boat).  Since these came, for the most part, in two-bite portions, we didn't feel like we received our money's worth.  

Looking back, I know we won't be returning any time soon."}

They gave us the crab cakes on the house and apologized. Then when we asked for our leftovers in a box they threw my wife's leftovers away by mistake and only gave me my leftovers.

I made a reservation for the five of us at 8pm on a Friday night. Once checked in, we had to wait for the teppanyaki table to be clear. We decided to go into the bar area and order a few beverages. The bartender came to greet us promptly and offered suggestions from the menu. We ordered items from sake to wine and waters. After about 15minutes we were called over by a very rude hostess who was to seat is and the other party. 

Once we were seated, our sever came to greet us immediately. She was friendly and warm in her greeting and offered anyone who did not have a beverage something to drink. We also all decided to order two orders of the edamame appetizer to share. After about 5-10 minutes of looking over the menu and receiving the rest of the drinks, she came back to take our order. We ordered everything from kids items (my children), to spicy chicken, tuna steak and shrimp & scallops.

Now each of the adult entrees came with soups and salads. These both were served before the edamame. Strange... I come from a world of chefs where the appetizer should be served BEFORE the next courses. Not after. Finally, the edamame came out and it was so very interesting (and not in a good way) how one of the orders was perfectly steamed and hot, yet the other was stone cold. At this point, I was not too upset as my children and guests were happy to consume the vegetable. It was also seemingly convenient how quickly those first few items came out. 

Now comes the worst. From the time we received and finished the soups, salads and appetizers (again in that order) to the time we finally saw our table side chef was approximately 45 minutes! I am sure you are thinking that this is surely an exaggeration. I am sorry to report that it is not as I wear a watch. We sat with no food or attentions for nearly an hour! I have never in my life had this happen before. It seemed as though the world stopped at our table. We all, including the other people sitting at our table, noticed that other tables were being served and attended to. Even one that was seated AND ordered after us!

When our 'cook' finally arrived, he seemed frazzled from the beginning. The first thing he did was drop food on the floor and had to excuse himself with an apology to run to the kitchen to get more. Not a good way to take care of extremely hungry guests... W/children. As he began to cook, I noticed that he was leaving certain things on the hotter spots of the flat top than he should have. This was causing bits to get burnt and we all could smell it. While he attempted to entertain us, he did the opposite. His voice was quiet and extremely unenthusiastic. I felt as if he did not even want to be there. This caused the intended fun evening for my children to be very dull and almost depressing.

Another thing I noticed was that he was cooking things one item at a time... For the entire table. By this I mean after he did the onion 'volcano' and the fried rice, he cooked all the vegetables, served them, then cleaned the grill. Then cooked the chicken, served it accordingly, then cleaned the grill. Then cooked the red meat, served it, then cleaned the grill. And finally the seafood, served it to the appropriate people then cleaned the grill. After a good 20 minutes of cooking, (and this again is after the 45 we waited to see our cook and uncooked food) we finally got to eat our food. However, as you can imagine, the foods served first were cold while the ones served last were hot. For instance, in my case specifically, I had hot scallops and shrimp paired with cold vegetables and fried rice. Oh, almost forgot, he did not even serve one of my child's side dishes. The children's meals are supposed to come with corn and only one received it. I had to divide up the one portion for both my children while the other party's kids each got their own portion. The food distribution was quite uneven.

Overall, the experience caused my kids to be out at this restaurant from our reservation time of 8 all the way past 11pm! I typically do not indulge in 3 hour dinners unless I am with adults only and it is in a fine dining setting which this was far from. Not my ideal situation in the least. The food that I experience at the proper temperature was decent yet there was very little of that. Even with all this happening we did not once see a manager at all to apologize or attempt to explain why we had to wait so long. The only good thing was that our waitress seemed happy and attempted to do her best in taking care of us which is why we still tipped accordingly. I will say that due to this experience, I will express in detail my dislike and disappointment of this establishment to all my fellow chefs, foodies, restauranteurs and friends and family. This casual and supposedly fun and eventful place turned out to be a frustrating and boring time. This is NOT a place I am likely to ever mention in any light again ever again."}

Must say my focus was more on the company than the food but here's what I can tell you:

Friends ordered the Lobster Spinach Queso for an appetizer.  I had a little and it was tasty but not spectacular.  Nice big chunks of lobster which was a nice surprise.  

I had the Pecan Crusted Trout.  The fish itself was so-so, not much seasoning and the portion was small.  It comes with a peach/cilantro salsa on top that I didn't care for and scraped off.  The star on the plate was the side of tortilla slaw.  Red cabbage, carrots, tortilla strips in a vinegary dressing.  I ate all of that and could have eaten more.

Their bread...to die for.  I could have been happy sitting there eating just that with butter and they could have charged as much as my entree and still I'd be happy. 

The birthday girl had the Aspen Sirloin and said it was just okay.  My other friend ordered the French Dip Sandwich but she was so into her side dishes that she filled up too fast and didn't even try it.  I'll let you know if she says it was good as leftovers.  The side that she said was great was the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes.  

The birthday girl loved her free dessert, the Big Daddy Chocolate Cake.  I love a low-key birthday dessert presentation and Firebirds did it well, just a candle and a happy birthday wish, no songs.  The portion of gooey chocolate cake was huge, with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce on the side.  Very yum.

Service was great, drinks were refilled frequently.  The staff was patient with us, not asking us to clear out as we sat chatting even though the dinner crowd was descending.  

One note about the parking...it was fine when we got there around 3:45 but it was a death match as we were leaving.  People trolling around, cutting each other off, zooming into spaces.  Craziness!"}

We decided to stop at about 730pm on a Friday night and while it was very busy were weren't waiting long for a table. We sat at the bar and ordered some Blue Moon drafts while we waited. Very tasty. 

We were seated about 15 minutes later at a very comfy booth. I ordered the 22 oz prime rib. My guest had the grilled shrimp and strawberry salad. 

We were brought fresh bread, still hot from the oven, to enjoy while we waited for our entrees. There's really nothing better than fresh bread, in my opinion. 

The entrees were a little slow to come out but my guest was very pleased with her very beautiful and tasty salad. My herb roasted prime rib was delicious as well and came out cooked exactly as I had requested. The mashed potatoes I had as a side were very tasty as well. 

If we disregard the time it took to get our entrees, I would say the service was fantastic. She was very attentive and seemed to be conscious of not interrupting the conversation. 

The price was reasonable for a steak house type dinner and I most certainly consider this place as superior alternative to Outback Steakhouse or Black Angus type of restaurant. 

I would highly recommend!"}

It's always more enjoyable with a lively group but the cooks are always entertaining, in a cheesy, G-rated kind of way.

As for the food, I agree that the SUSHI here is always tasty but I've gotten rolls where the rice wasn't sticky and the roll fell apart (never a good thing). Sashimi always tasted fresh and a decent portion for the price.

I always upgrade to the Fried Rice and I recommend eating it right after it comes off the grill; otherwise, there's not much difference from the local Panda chain. The seafood/steak combinations are best but everyone knows that grilling shrimp/scallops/lobster is the quickest way to dry out/overcook seafood so it's never as enjoyable as sauteed or steamed seafood. But, alas, it's the experience of having it cooked in front of you that brings people back and that's probably why I go back 2-3 times a year."}

We went for a family birthday dinner, and it started out looking promising. I had been told that it was on the level of the Keg, which I love. But then I got a laminated menu like I was at a diner, and my opinion started to change. Their menu was quite limited - for example: I think there were only 2 "side" items that weren't potato. But despite the small variety of choices, I chose a rib-eye steak, which I love, even at lower priced venues such as Texas Roadhouse. I also got a salad to start. My husband ordered the steak Delmonico and a salad to start. My father in law and brother in law ordered the same dish, a medium Filet. 

Three of us ordered salads, and even though they had good flavor, they were completely overdressed. My salad which was just a mixed green salad was chopped in such a way that it was very very difficult to eat. It wasn't large enough to stab with my fork, or scoop up either. 

There were seven of us at the table, and when our food did come out, they had a lot of difficulty figuring out who got what dish. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but it did kind of kill the mood as far as "here's your food, let's eat!" The other confusion came from the fact that my husband and I had the exact same cut of meat - both medium well rib-eyes. Despite the fact that I had ordered Medium rare, and he had ordered a medium rare Delmonico. (and yes, I know that there is differences in thought about what that is, but it should have not been the same cut as mine) My father in law had a nicely medium filet, but my brother in law's was medium rare. So out of 4 steaks, they only cooked one correctly. At a steak house, I would NOT expect 75% of the steak to be the incorrect temp!

Not everyone was disappointed. My mother-in-law liked her salmon (after she was told that they didn't have her first fish of choice), and my sister in law enjoyed her trout.  And of course my father in law enjoyed his correctly cooked steak. 

None of us sent our food back, as it was edible, but I know that after this experience, I will not be back. This place was too high priced to be this disappointing. There are many other restaurants within walking distance that are much much better, and personally, I would much rather have a cheap steak at Texas Roadhouse where I can have a large variety of choices for sides, as I know that it will be the correct temp. If I'm looking for something high priced and delicious, it will be the Keg or Flemings - definitely not here."}

That's fine except that we did not get the other stuff that comes with it, rice, soup, salad, vegies, shrimp etc. only double meat and full price. Not good. The other thing that was not good was some young twenty something year old and her boyfriend thinking it's ok to stuff your new puppy in your Coach handbag and sit down to a dinner table. NO, it was not a medical issue puppy, it was just a pug puppy. Completely unacceptable behavior. The manager saw the puppy and did nothing. If I wanted to sit down and eat with dogs I would go to the park not to a somewhat fancy restaurant. There were several other mistakes with our food but it did taste good."}

Last year we did the same but in Miami and I loved the sushi. But the sushi at this location was not as good as in Miami as the fish was not very fresh. We both ordered sushi combination deluxe. I loved the eel. It was very fatty and tasty with the sauce. Raw shrimp, salmon and yellow tail were nice too but the rest were just okay. The fish egg sushi tasted really weird. It was like someone poured 1 TBS of sake on the top by accident and I barely could swallow down in my throat. 

It was very busy and loud on Thursday night. We did not want to wait for seats so we decided to sit and eat at the bar area. The waiter was very nice but not around most of the time so we could not get another cup of tea. It took a while to get soy sauce for sushi too. 

After we finished dining, they sang a birthday song for me and took a picture which I could download from their website. I think it is a good service and I want them to keep it. 

Maybe the location (Phoenix) affected the freshness of sushi. The sushi at their Miami location was fresh and tasty. Maybe other food there is nice. We did not try their teppanyaki. You can choose a table where they cook in front of you at the table. That could be a nice and fun performance to see. 

Overall our experience was good and I recommend this place for fun occasions."}

Fun when you are will a fun crowd.  The chef also helps and ours was cool.  Scott, our white but swears he's the brother of a Japanese chef, was cool.

Prices are high, to be expected with high end meat and seafood.

And yes, we must always upgrade to the chicken fried rice.

I love the ginger sauce over the mustard based sauce.  It has a nice tang and goes well with everything.  Your chef will give you more if you happen to use all of yours over the fried rice as I did.

I recommend going with 8 people.  Take the whole table and take all for yourselves.  I suggest any meat and seafood combo.  i recommend upgrading to the fried rice.  And if you have a whimsical side, get the drink that comes in a ceramic Buhdda.

My first and last visit started with our group of 8 arriving at 5:50pm. We were told a 45 min wait. After all, we had a group large enough for one table no need to piece us with others. Finally at 7:15, I asked to speak to the manager. After complaining, we were immediately seated and given free appetizers. 

I thought the night would be salvaged. NoPE!! It took them until 8pm to start the grill and 8:15 until the chef started to cook. I will not be returning to this establishment anytime in the near future.

I made a reservation for a party of four for Friday night to celebrate my fiance's birthday. We were the only people at the table. We got seated and comfortable, and then we were asked to move to accommodate other people joining the table. Umm..ok. 

Our waiter, Zach, was either new or inexperienced, or both. The other party had to ask for their drink three times. He forgot about my fiancés sushi roll that he ordered, and finally brought it out 30 minutes later..WARM! Then managed to take the wrong ice cream order that my fiancé requested..and to top it off never took our picture (they are always supposed to). Overall, very slow and inattentive. 

Our cook, Saul, was mediocre. Nothing special. Certainly did not entertain or connect with any of us at the table. 

The food was also mediocre. Definitely not worth the price. Nothing comes out at the same time. Which makes absolutely no sense. Why would you cook the rice, serve it,then the veggies, meat, and then a side of onions? All were served 10+ minutes apart. Makes zero sense. 

Sigh. Never again."}

We visited Firebird's again this evening.  We had a wonderful dinner. My husband and I sat at a table in the bar area and were promptly greeted by our server. She was extremely helpful, polite and did not mind answering all our questions. We ordered some beer + a double shot of whiskey for my husband and champagne for myself for drinks with the lobster queso for the appetizer, which by the way was amazing. For dinner I had the sesame salmon and my husband had the 14oz NY strip. The salmon was some of the best salmon I have ever had, I was very pleased with my meal. Perfectly cooked with great flavor. My husband's steak was very flavorful, however, there was quite a bit of gristle which was inedible..... But the parts we ate were delicious. We were very happy with our visit this time, our server was excellent and the food was great. I'm glad that Firebird's were able to make things right and bring us back as guests.

Update 4/16/13
I was contacted by a representative from Firebird's, and was offered a gift card to make things right. Hopefully they come through and we have a much better experience on our next visit. Will update again after our next visit.

Original review 3/31/13
My husband and I came here for our anniversary. Food was good, I did not expect less for the price... So I'm glad the food was good. Service was lacking. Our server was slooooooowww, and nowhere to be found most of the time. She was so slow, our appetizer came out before our drinks. No sorry, not even any excuses. All the stars are for the food..... I used to love this place, but the poor service will keep me from returning."}

We therefore had the entire hibachi/tepanyaki table to ourselves!  It was fun, and the fact that it was just the two of us sped up dinner service considerably.  I ordered Benihana rolls as an appetizer; they were basically tasty California rolls, loosely packed but a real bargain at only $4.75.  For my entree, I went with the Hibachi scallops.  Now unlike Kyoto (the Japanese restaurant I usually hit up on my birthday), there are not a whole lot of veggies prepared as sides with your entree.  In a way, that was a good thing, because I didn't waste any food.  I got a ton of scallops, and I took home what I couldn't finish.  It was great value for the price!  Still, my chef was not Asian and the emptiness of the restaurant did make it feel a little weird.  Perhaps I'll add a star when I update my review after the next visit..."}

She suggested their "Rub", and I was so amazed and loved it!  And they make their own creamy, garlicky dressing ...... and wait for it, their croutons are seasoned well!

Needless to say it was lovely.  For you spicy chicken ceasar lovers I suggest it.  (Note $8 Without chicken, add $7 with chicken).  Worth it.

I have been eating at Benihanas since I was born, no lie. It is my all time favorite restaurant no matter how hokey the tricks and jokes may be, a smile is plastered on my face from beginning to end. I have encountered fallen knives, shrimp tails soaring through the air, you name it. No matter how amazing or not so amazing the  chef has been, I always know I'll be leaving full and extremely satisfied with delicious & fresh Japanese food.

This location was very beautiful, clean, and modern. From the moment you enter the building you know you're in for a culinary adventure. Entertainment at your table, and delicious food that never seems to end!

Absolutely recommend to anyone and everyone! Definitely stop by on an empty stomach!!! They don't joke around with their portions."}

We came in for happy hour, around 6PM. Lucky us, there was a table that just left so we grabbed it. Everything started perfectly, great service, great happy hour prices. 
We ordered 3 cocktails, one of them was a berry Moscow Mule, it was excellent! So we ordered another one and weirdly it didn't taste the same, so we asked our waitress if it was the same bartender that made it, she came back and told us that actually they ran out of Ginger Beer so they put Ginger Ale instead. Seriously? That's horrible customer service and we felt like they were robbing us, it's like ordering a gin tonic and they only give you the tonic. We were very mad after this.
The waitress apologized and of course we didn't drink it. 
The waitress asked us if we wanted to take a look at the wine list instead, we did, and we ordered the Meomi Pinot Noir, she asked if we wanted a glass or the bottle, we said just a glass. Came the bill, the glass of wine was $16?! On the menu, there were 3 prices, $12, $16 (1/2 bottle) and $36 or $32 (bottle, doesn't remember). 
They took off $4 at the end because we told them it wasn't normal, poor customer service again.
Oh and I won't even mention the $1 surcharge to get my shrimp spicy (wth...) 
Anyway, not a great experience overall, I don't think we will be back. It's sad, because the food was excellent!"}

I ordered the steak kabob type deal and my girlfriend got the mahi which was the bomb. The streak wad ok but not as good as the fish. The waiter was good so we liked him. The desert was super good and the portion was so big we couldn't finish but that's a good thing because we like left overs for lunch the next day.

The free bread was amazing.  It's bread! Who would get excited about that?  I am shocked that bread could be this good.  It really makes me wonder what it was I have been eating with my PB and Js all these years.
For the entree, I had the 9oz filet and the Parmesan mashed potatoes.  From the moment the filet hit my tongue, the flavor explosion that hit my mouth was intense.  Hands down, the best steak I have ever eaten - even better than those in the Midwest.  It was cooked perfectly, had an amazing crust, and simply melted in my mouth.

I had the brownie with the salted caramel sauce.  While this was good, I feel the salted caramel could have been a little more flavorful.

I am surprised that I haven't gone there sooner.  This is definitely my new "go-to" restaurant for all special occasions."}

I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a good steak and good service and feel free to bring the kids along... It's not that kind of stuffy steakhouse where kids are looked down on. Another cool thing that they do is they have a call ahead service to get on their wait list. We were not aware of this since it was our first visit so we waited about 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday night, but many folks walked right in and were seated as they had called ahead. It's in a busy area with many choices of restaurants, but this one definitely will be one that we go to again."}

Yesterday my wife and I decided to see if we could get in for teppanyaki. We knew there would probably be a wait, and we were about 20 minutes away. The girl who answered the phone said they couldn't take reservations for less than an hour's notice. I was fine with that and asked if it was busy and she said "there's only two people in the lobby, but that can change any minute." I said we'll be there in 20 and hope to beat the rush, and we hung up. When we go there they said the wait was 2 hours! I asked them why they they didn't say that when I called and they first said I must have called the wrong location. I hit redial on my cell and it rang right to their front desk. So I said obviously I called the right place. Then they RUDELY said they never said that to me on the phone and asked who I talked to. I said it was a girl and they said there were only 2 girls answering the phone, but neither wanted to admit it. Then, one eventually admitted it, and I said "so you did answer my call, then?! Why didn't you tell me how long the wait was when I asked instead of misleading me by saying there was only 2 people in the lobby?" She only halfway said she was sorry and the manager was literally standing right there. I basically left because they made no attempt to make it right. Apparently they are willing to lose customers. Way unprofessional, and the decrease in their Yelp ratings over the last year shows I'm not the only one."}

I had remembered we loved it on our previous visit.  There's a lot of difference in the setting whether you sit inside or sit outside.  We made a huge mistake sitting on the patio.  It was well after the lunch hour but long before dinner hour too.

There are speakers on the patio playing music.  I'm thinking more for a happy hour effect.  However, it wasn't happy hour and all the guests on the patio were trying to talk over the music that was playing.  It was very loud and we even had to scoot ourselves in to hear the two of us at the same table.   Besides that we were fighting flies and received several bites -- mosquitos or some type of biting bug.  We definitely would never sit on the patio again.

Food sizes are huge and very good.   Cole slaw sauce is amazing.  Service was very good except for when we asked for our bill.  It took a while to get it and that's when we realized we had to get out of there before we got more bites.

Menu prices were a little spendy for salads, sandwiches and burgers but then, maybe we didn't get a lunch menu."}

It was a toss up between here and the Elephant Bar next door and at least on the Internet the menu looked way more appetizing from the Firebird. 

Monday at 5pm so no wait. Menu is pretty simple but classy. You can still get anything from a salad or burger to a nice slab of prime rib or lobster tail. The decor was warm and inviting with high ceilings brown tones of a hillside hunting lodge; down to the 6x6 bull elk mounted on the wall. 

Jen ordered a salad and I added the quesadilla and onion rings for appetizers. I am a huge fan of battered apps not breaded. The onion rings here are battered but very lightly then coated with some panko breading. New to me as I am set in my beer battered ways, but very very good. The quesadilla was decent but since I am not a fan of mushy black beans which in this case were an ingredient, I wasn't in awe but figured it want horrible. Another positive is they have the really good creamy ranch not the knock off crap. 

Next up was the prime rib. I was really torn from what I wanted going back and forth amongst the lobster and bacon wrapped filet, the prime rib, or a plain ribeye. They have literally, an actual wood fire grill which I love and almost mandates you order at least something from the grill. 

Both mine and Jen's prime rib was cooked perfectly and oh so tender. She was mostly full already so barely touched her green beans but agreed the prime was delish! My side was seasoned steak fries which were as awesome as we all hope they will be when we order them. 

The highlight was our server Pedro. Perfect timing, very polite, non-intrusive, and silent service when applicable. I preached silent service for twenty years to my staff advising you don't need to interrupt the guests constantly. Its priceless and oblivious to most servers and guests. Loved this place."}

We ordered 5 or 6 rolls and the stand out was the rainbow roll. Fish tasted really fresh and tasted delicious. You must try the goza's, they reminded me of goza's I have tried in Vancouver BC and San Francisco.

Lot of food and drink and bill was only $40 before tip!"}

I've been to a Benihana restaurant in California and back home in Hawaii, the service was impeccable and the food was amazing.

Here, my first time visiting this place was an epic tragedy.

As I walked in, the hostess was smiling and had a bubbly personality and was cordial. I was told it was self seating, so I found a nice little table all to myself.

My waitress is a whole other story. 

She didn't greet me or ask how I was doing, instead she dropped to different menus and asked, "Just you?"

"Yes."

She took away the other place setting and walked away.

No smile. It looked like she was pissed. Perhaps it was permanent resting B---- face.

She came back and quickly asked what I would like to drink. Tea of course.

Tea came out and then the big question, "you want to order now?"

Good news, I'm in a really good mood and I wasn't going to let this persons mood get to me.

I ordered for the lunch menu and asked that my steak be rare.

Soup arrived, it was good. Nothing that blew my palette. I did asked for a little wasabi and added a little piece of it to add a slight kick to the broth.

When my plate arrived, I saw immediately that the beef was fully cooked. 

I did not bother the waitress to have it sent back (yes, I'm that nice of a customer and not petty).

Even the manager came to ask how was everything, I didn't have the heart to tell him that my waitress forgot to bring her personality with her to work.

Now, the table next to me, I have to say, made me a little jealous. Their waitress was smiling, she attentive, and anticipated her guests needs like bringing extra napkins, took away the chopstick wrappers off the table, etc...

Overall, the food was not what I remembered, it was just okay.

Ultimately, the service with my waitress was a horrible experience. I still tipped her and have her feedback, I let her know she didn't even look at my steak to notice that it was fully cooked - not rare, and still proceeded to serve it to me. I also said it would help if you smiled at your customers. Besides myself, she had three other tables and she was the same with them.

You may have a different encounter than I did, I will say, customer service here is like. Roulette game!

#GoodLuck!

What can I say, I was expecting more. I had gone to another Benihana's in New Jersey, but we only went to the Teppanyaki part of it. I signed up online to get alerts for specials and such, so I got a $30 certificate for my birthday. 

Went here Friday, with the hubster, because I called to see when their all you can eat sushi was. Luckily its everyday! Couldn't wait to have our massage and sushi date night! 

Now, we've been to Japan, have had awesome sushi, love 202 Crazy Fish Sushi in Tempe and decided to try Benihana's...big mistake.
I should've learned after we had gone to Kabuki, knowing that it's a chain and that the sushi is, well, bad. The variety was good, the fish wasn't its freshest fish and who puts mayo on their sushi? Why does this happen at chains? The sushi chef was Japanese, as was our waitress, so we talked to her a bit abt our visit to Japan, my sister in law, etc. But the sushi was warm, fell apart and the fish, bland...I'll just stickl w/ Crazy Fish, who does his sushi with love and knows what my husband and I like."}

I am very pleased by this restaurant how they deal with customer complaints- instead of viewing as complaints, they actually view as the point to improve.

On 3-16-17, I had reserved seating for a party of 25. To my surprise, I was told by Mary Wentzel that I can tell her if my party grows a little, a day or two before and she would accommodate. I sent her an email that she responded to regarding my party size increasing from 25-28 people. I told them it was for my engagement dinner which was a surprise to my now fiancé. I was told we as a group had to order strictly from the group menu I had to pick out, and Mary and I established that checks would be separate, not on one bill. When we arrived they got us in pretty quickly, but when we sat down, there were only 24 chairs. I then spoke with a hostess whose name I do not have. I said to her "Hi, I told Mary the party size was 28." She responded with "No, you said 25." I then said "Mary told me to email her if it grows, which I did." The hostess stoped listening to me near the end and said she would be right back. A man arrived and it was unclear if he was a manager. At this time I had pulled up my email to prove to them I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on them. I showed the email to the manager who responds with "Your getting the table anyway." In a way that was not cordial in any manner. I was pretty upset with his tone considering this was already prearranged, and I was bringing them 28 guests at $37 a mouth!!! I was respectful the whole time, and I truly felt treated like a liar. But it became more irritating as the night went on. I had, a week prior, asked if my party can order off of the menu. I was expressly told after exhausting all options, that we must stick to the group menu, understandably. 

Later in the evening, the waiter comes up to me to say "Party guests want to order off the menu, do you want me to charge them separately?" I asked "I thought we are not allowed to order off the menu?" He said "You can, do you want that on your bill or no?" I then continued with " I told Mary that it will be separate checks. We should all be charged separately." 

It was a night I proposed to my girlfriend, and all the planning and emailing with Firebirds was totally pointless. This caused me a lot of stress mainly due to the rude tone of the hostess and who I think was the manager. I would have also personally ordered from the menu because the group menu didn't offer what I wanted, but I already ordered when I found out I could have ordered from the menu. 

All in all, I was truly appalled by the way I was talked to. So much so, I made this yelp account over it. All I wanted was cordial respect and good food, and all I got was good food."}

Given proximity to my office, people choose it fairly often for work events, but I can't really say I have had anything that is really memorable and I like. 

The lobster spinach dip is ok - in my opinion kind of bland. It's runny, and not super cheesy, looks like it was scooped out of a crock pot. There is very little lobster in it.

The crab cakes as well - just bland. Nothing to be excited about. There are 2 crab cakes and mountains of this ridiculous slaw.

The chicken quesadillas are, well, where's the cheese? 

The tenderloin salad, well, the meat was burnt tasting. 

I did have the tortilla soup once, and that was pretty good. The spinach salad that I also ordered was - just boring. I guess what I would say is this really is like an over-priced Applebees. 

The Smokehouse Chicken sandwich was super dry the time I got it, and well, I guess I expect something with "smokehouse" in the name to be smoked - suffice to say it is not.

I can't say that it is "bad", because it's not. It's just average. The service is pretty good..oh wait, and if you get the bread - that is pretty dang amazing. I highly recommend that. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Overall, I won't be going here by my own choice."}

If it wasn't such a great grade of beef I would have sent it back but it was still good, just under cooked.  My suggestion, cut the fillet a little thinner to cook or butterfly it if the kitchen can't get the center the right temp.  There is always using a thermometer and lowering the cooking temp too.  Other than that, no complaint."}

The entire table (my husband, my 2 kids & I), and another family of 4) sat there quiet waiting for some kind of entertainment from the chef to take place. That's what Benihana is all about, right!? And to top it off, the food was under seasoned and had no flavor.

I honestly think our chef was new, and needed some training. But in that case, he shouldn't be placed on the floor on the busiest day of the week (Saturday). We paid over $220, and it was not even worth it... I'm sorry to say. :-("}

The hostess stoped listening to me near the end and said she would be right back. A man arrived and it was unclear if he was a manager. At this time I had pulled up my email to prove to them I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on them. I showed the email to the manager who responds with "Your getting the table anyway." In a way that was not cordial in any manner. I was pretty upset with his tone considering this was already prearranged, and I was bringing them 28 guests at $37 a mouth!!! I was respectful the whole time, and I truly felt treated like a liar. But it became more irritating as the night went on. I had, a week prior, asked if my party can order off of the menu. I was expressly told after exhausting all options, that we must stick to the group menu, understandably. 

Later in the evening, the waiter comes up to me to say "Party guests want to order off the menu, do you want me to charge them separately?" I asked "I thought we are not allowed to order off the menu?" He said "You can, do you want that on your bill or no?" I then continued with " I told Mary that it will be separate checks. We should all be charged separately." 

It was a night I proposed to my girlfriend, and all the planning and emailing with Firebirds was totally pointless. This caused me a lot of stress mainly due to the rude tone of the hostess and who I think was the manager. I would have also personally ordered from the menu because the group menu didn't offer what I wanted, but I already ordered when I found out I could have ordered from the menu. 

All in all, I was truly appalled by the way I was talked to. So much so, I made this yelp account over it. All I wanted was cordial respect and good food, and all I got was good food. 


EDIT* 4/15/17 

The manager called me at a convenient time and was apologetic. Once they verified my complaint was legitimate, they made up for my poor experience. They truly did make things right. Thank you Firebirds! And again, their food was amazing!"}

"There's open seating over there with no wait or you'll have to wait for 45 minutes." Was the immediate response. I guess she wasn't expecting me to agree to wait because her hand was still pointing to over there. When she realized I was still standing there, she took my name to add me to the list. 10 minutes later I was being escorted to a table to sit along with 3 other parties. So much for that 45 minutes, huh?

The waiter comes around, introduces himself and takes drink orders. It takes him about 15 minutes to bring out drinks. And then it was about 15-20 minutes between soup and salad. Finally, the cool comes out an hour after we were seated. Drinks are empty, soup and salad is gone. 

The cook was nice, he seemed a little bit nervous. I think he was fairly new. It took the cook 1 hours and 7 minutes to finish cooking from start to finish. As you can imagine, you had to eat your food separate unless you wanted it cold. Rice first, then shrimp appetizer, then zucchini, then the protein, finally the onion. By the time the onions made it to my plate (roughly an hour after the rice) I had no more food on my plate. 

Do I even have to tell you what waiting for the check was like?

I already contacted google, FB, and your guest relations. (In case you want to ask me to contact guest relations to make it right)"}

I went with my friends on a Thursday night, we had 6:30 pm reservations, we got their early so we hit the bar for happy hour, let me tell you I think I have found me a new drink!! The Mango Saketini!! Ohh mmmyy goodnesss its sooo yummy! Had me about 3 of them that night, man why is it that Thursday nights always feel like it should be a Friday,,,I don't get it. 
We got to our table and come to find out their where 2 other birthday girls! So 3 at one table! Leos rule I say!   Our chef for the night was Roberto, he was cute and put on a good show, our servers I didn't catch their names, one was nice eye candy, ladies let me tell you Benihana's has some nice looking eye candy!  Of course our server kept calling me ma'am must have had my grandma gear on haha. 
But about the food, let me tell you!! I ordered  1/2 rolls of the Boston & Philly sushi rolls, both where delish and so fresh, the salmon and tuna was soo dang good made me wish I ordered full rolls. 
For dinner I ordered the hibachi steak, my friends ordered the Land n Sea and Deluxe Treat, now let me tell you  on the land n sea the scallops where buttery good and the shrimp appetizer, I don't even like shrimp, but was very sad to see mine was all gone, it was that good.  The lobster on the deluxe treat wasn't that good to me, it was fishy. The veggies where very fresh and grilled just right, I didn't care for the dipping sauce for the veggies, it was a little too salty for me. 
 But overall the place and the food were great! I'm guessing Benihana's from what I saw is the type of place you goto for a special occasion and the place had a great vibe and great staff, can't wait until I get to help celebrate a friend's birthday or whatever reason that brings me back to Benihana's...Shoot might just goto Happy Hour to get that dang Mango Saketini!"}

This restaurant is well decorated, cocktail is delicious and definitely gives out an relaxing atmosphere to hang out with friends or your love one (date night is highly recommended). 

To start off, I ordered a "Firebird Signature Martini" ($10). I am not a big drinker, but generally prefers fruity cocktail that is not overly sweet. This drink is delicious especially if you like pineapple flavor. The complimentary bread was still hot when it was served (best way to start off your meal on a Friday night). For appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes and came with two pieces. The dish was well decorated and goes great with the orange sauce. If you plan on ordering this dish, don't forget to pile up the veggies in the middle of the plate and eat that with it. Your taste bud would love experiencing different flavor all at the same time. 

For main entrée, I ordered a 12oz Prime Rib (medium rare). It was so juicy and tender I literally finished it within 15 minutes (or less). My friend ordered a filet mignon a side of lobster tail. They messed up the order and brought us shrimps as a side instead. We waited an additional 15 minutes to get it corrected and they were apologetic. Filet Mignon was also tender and juicy. Personally, I will still choose prime rib over it (personal preference). When the meal was finished, I was so full and simply do not have any room for dessert. 

I did see the waitress stopping by the manager to see if he could do something about the bill due to the mix up. Unfortunately, they've decided not to comp anything (perhaps throw in a free dessert?). I was not there expecting anything for free, but we were definitely shock that they did nothing. I guess they would only comp customers who throws around an attitude, screaming and yelling when the meal was wrong. Since we were being nice about the whole mixed up, we ended up getting nothing. 

Other than that, our experience here was wonderful. I'll definitely come back here for another cocktail and delicious meal with my girlfriends."}

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  So disappointed that I just couldn't keep eating it anymore for the sake of being full.  I actually went somewhere else, because I was still hungry, and got a sandwich.  

The reasons why I didn't enjoy my meal:

1.  Rice was super mushy.  Eventually, every sushi they served me had medicre rice, which totally ruined the whole meal.  
2.  They put so much rice in their sushi so that AYCE diners will get full sooner.   I actually had to tell the sushi chef to kick back on the rice.
3.  The fish was not as fresh as I am used to in Southern California.  One of the servers told me that this was a common complaint by non-local diners. 

Needless to say, I didn't go back here during my remaining 3 days.  I actually preferred the Japanese mall food court restaurant over this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Benihana...but this one failed me."}

That year I had a rather unpleasant birthday experience that left me not wanting to return. 

::cue flashback:: 
I had made a reservation for a set amount of people but had a few additional friends show up as a surprise for my birthday. This upset the manager at the time and he chastised me in front of all my guests for being unaware that there was going to be extra people. An honest mistake but the manager made such a huge deal about it being a safety issue that some of my friends left to appease him. However, throughout the meal that followed, other restaurant guests (not from our table) were walking directly behind our chef while his knives were out and in use. If safety was such an issue you'd think something like that would not happen or the manager would do something about it. Nope! 
::end flashback:: 

Needless to say, I swore off Benihana until this year, when I decided to give them another try...or two, to be exact.  

Both visits were around 7:45/8:00pm. Both times we were early for our reservation. Both times we had to wait passed our reservation time to be seated and guests without reservations were sat before us. Why even make a reservation at all? Perhaps as a courteous to the restaurant so they can attempt to staff properly? Thanks?

Teppanyaki is communal dining around a grill so you will be sat with others you don't know. If that bothers you, I suggest gathering enough of your friends and family together that your group will take up a whole table. The other guests we were sat with during this year's visits have been great so no issues there. 

Visit A: Friendly and entertaining chef, plenty of drink refills, great commemorative birthday photo, and very accommodating of dietary restrictions. 

Visit B: Felt bad for the chef who seem overwhelmed, issues with multiple orders, lacked drink refills, not a great photo and special requests were ignored. 

Both times dinner took us until closing time (10pm). Two hours for a meal seems a bit long to me and the younger kids at the table during Visit A were practically asleep by the time the check arrived.  

Also, green tea is offered as part of the dining experience. The first time I accept it and stayed up WAYYYYYYYY too late that evening. The second time, I declined. Maybe a decaffeinated option could be offered later in the day?

During both visits the bathroom was gross. Three stalls and each had issues: gross, messy, unflushed, and no toilet paper. Dirty bathrooms make you think dirty kitchen. Yuck-O! 

Thank goodness for their genius marketing with the $30 birthday coupon or I doubt they'd have as much business as they do. Both visits, almost every table was sung "Happy Birthday". We are now pros at joining along with the song set to the tune of "If You Are Happy and You Know it Clap Your Hands"...Which seems like a subtle subliminal messaging now that I think about it. Touché, Benihana, touché."}

The waiter informed us to take advantage of happy hour drinks and menu we would have to move to outside patio seating (this obviously to show passing vehicle traffic that the place had diners so this was a Firebirds profit decision at diner's expense).  The bare metal chairs soon became uncomfortable and with no overhead fans, misters or a breeze we were sweating and had to talk over the sounds of passing vehicle traffic.  The Coors Light tap having been on the fritz for 2 days I ordered champagne & consumed the small glass while awaiting dinner and ordered a 2nd glass prior to the meal arriving.  The food came and our waiter failed to reappear (I assume he was distracted serving his more important inside non-happy hour customers) until we'd finished eating so the entire meal with no drink.  Soon the flies found us and were swarming all over everything then an unsmiling businesslike manager came with a much too lengthy explanation about the beer problem and blamed the outside seating requirement in the computer.  The waiter was inattentive, drinks not available and uncomfortable seating policy.  To their credit not only was the bill forgiven but we received a $50.00 gift certificate to get us back but I doubt anything will change internally!"}

The burger was cooked to medium with a little pink, and the bacon was nicely cooked and crisp - very tasty burger - the wood fire grill adds lots of flavor. The bun was a little weak - did not really hold up until the last bite.  I sat at the left side of the bar and was trying to watch the baseball game on the tv above - but the blinding sun glare from the glass door to the left was as if I was in a spotlight - not very comfortable - was really bothering my eyes - they should have had the shutters closed.  The steak frys were good, but unfortunately the small amount of ketchup they had brought in a small plastic cup ran out with more than half the frys still remaining.  I understand that these so called upscale places do not want a ketchup bottle sitting around- and yes I could have asked for more instead of eating the last half of my frys dry, but come on Firebirds, no need to skimp on the ketchup...     Pedro was nice and polite, but the girl working with him never acknoweldged me, said hello, no smile, and never offered to get me another beer when I had completely finished my 1st beer.

Tonight I went to Benihana for the first time for my friend's birthday. We had a reservation for 8:00PM for 20 people. My friends and I arrived at 7:52PM and we let them know we were ready to be seated...since one person who was with our group was not there we had to wait to be seated...ok that's fine. So at about 8:20 the last person arrives and we ask to be seated. The hostess told us that we could not be seated since our reservation had to be given up. I asked why and she said cause our entire party wasn't here by 8:15. I couldn't believe that they didn't tell us about this rule! 
We were given free appetizers and some free rolls for the incontinence (which makes me think they double booked our table). At 9:25 we were FINALLY seated! 
I asked a hostess if she could bring me some soy sauce since I had ordered rolls at the bar and she said sure. 15 minutes later I still had not gotten my soy sauce so I got up and looked for it myself. I have been a hostess before and MANY MANY times I have accommodated guests by getting them little things that they need even if I was not their server.
I finished my rolls and shortly after I was sick. Seriously horrible customer service, horrible food and I will NOT be returning and I highly suggest that no one else visit this Benihana!"}

We had never been here before, but I had read a lot of reviews on Yelp and was really wanting to give it a try.  We were so glad we did!

We got right in and seated, we had Leah as our server.  She was very good and had a great personality.  Hubby wanted crab cakes for an appetizer but was worried about  getting filled up before dinner.  When Leah came to see if we wanted an appetizer, I looked at hubby and Leah started teasing him about what he wanted.  He went for the crab cakes, which we would split.  They were awesome, the sauce drizzled over them and the garnish slaw was incredible!  We almost licked the plate!  Oh, and the bread - butt bread as she called it (it DOES look like a butt!) was AWESOME!!!

For my entree, I had to select the Bleu Cheese Filet, so many had reviewed them on Yelp and I wanted to find out for myself how good it was.  As my side, I got the parmesan potatoes.  Hubby got the prime rib with southwest au gratin potatoes.  My steak was cooked to perfection - I like it medium rare, more to the rare side.  FABULOUS!!  It melted in my mouth and the blue cheese melted on top, was to die for.  Hubby's prime rib was also cooked perfect, also medium rare.  Not a lot of fat, tender and juicy - YUMMY!!  My potatoes were OK, nothing special.  His were much better, cheesy with some kick!  He out ordered me in the side dishes.  

For desert, which we took home, I selected the Key Lime Pie.  OMG....it was delicious!!!  Hubby chose the Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  Another winner!!!  Every item we selected Leah told us were their best sellers.  I told her I had read several Yelp reviews and I had made my choices based on the rave reviews.  We were both very impressed and will definately go here again on our next special occasion.  It is expensive, but it was well worth it.  Nice atmosphere, GREAT food, pleasant staff, you can't really ask for more when you want a special dinner out."}

I had visited Sunday and experienced DECENT service. So I decided to try HH to see what's its all about, nothing fancy. I arrived around 6:30 pm to plenty of space at the bar, so I sat quickly. After being seated for several minutes I was offered the opportunity to order.

Las Vegas Roll, Crunchy Shrimp Roll and a Tokyo Raspberry....Meeeh! Tasted like watery juice.

By 6:50 pm I'm ready to order, but FIRST I must have another drink. I quickly ordered a Yozu Margarita (I think thats what its called) and mom ordered another Benihana Punch.

We then proceeded to order our food. I opted for a bowl of shrimp fried rice and side salad, mom ordered the Sea Bass. After quietly waiting 20 mins with no second  beverage, I made note to one of the bartenders about our drinks. By 7:40 no food and no drinks. I watched 3 people behind the bar make drinks and clean. Where in the heck are my drinks?! When inquiring about the food, we were advised that it was almost done (someone told me that 15 mins ago). Now I'm hungry and thirsty. What makes it bad is that I ordered the drinks TWICE! At this point we're ready to go, so we ask for the food as such. 10 mins later the food arrives...Plated. I THOUGHT I ASKED FOR THIS TO GO! Why is it so difficult to get good service?

Benihana is hit or miss these days. More miss than hit."}

The prices where exceptional. They boasted an okay selection in martinis ($5) and bottled beers (Bud Light $3, Kirin Light $4) and offered other cocktails and well drinks. 

The food was excellent and the price was ridiculously low. We enjoyed beef dumplings (~$3.50), rainbow rolls ($5.25) and another appetizer that was so uninspiring I already forgot what it was. 

Our server, who was also the bartender, was getting worked by the non-stop mass of people waiting for tables, and making drinks. She had another bartender to help but he seemed to focused on grumbling and giving the bar a really negative vibe. 

Overall, we all have bad days, so being my first visit to Benihana, I'll take it as that. The good prices and pretty good food will have me returning soon enough."}

Scott was our chef and he was entertaining, attentive, and the food was amazing. I've had very little food that was better. To me it was impressive how busy they were on a Monday night.

Being of orient descent makes it difficult for me to find anything that passes my taste tests. I really am not big on chain food reataurants either. However, I somehow managed to think that coming here was a good idea. My boyfriend and I walked in with out a reservation and was told there was a slight wait. It was no big deal and we did not have to wait longer than about 10 minutes which was fine because we had some sake at the bar. Not too shabby I must say.

Once, seated, we joined 3 other couples at the teppanyaki table. (family styled seating) The waitress was kind and tried her hardest to get everyone on board with her spiel about the features/specials. However she was rudely cut off by one of the 'gentlemen' (and I use that term loosely) at our table. She seemed a bit new to working here but I like to give people a chance when I believe them to be a bit green. She was quick to taking orders but again, seemed thrown off too easily by a difficult customer. I think that maybe the staff needs a bit of training when it comes to making situations more comfortable for everyone.

We began by ordering the edamamme appetizer which I was sad to say was not very good. We ate it due to our hunger but for the small amount given and being charged $5 for it seemed a bit crazy. The cook that came prepare our food spoke way too fast but did an alright job serving the food while keeping everyone entertained. I ordered the filet and shrimp combination platter and my boyfriend orderd the scallops. The fried rice was delicious and seasoned very well. Our shrimp appetizer was preppared well too. Then came the disappointment. While his scallops were cooked nicely, they were fairly small. I was expecting for the price a bit larger scale of scallops. My Shrimp were cooked well as the appetizer shrimps were but when it came time for the filet...hmmm. For the price they charge it was sliced too small, underseasoned and nothing special at all.

At the end of the meal, mine came with a complimentary scoop of ice cream. Ha ha, my botfriend tried it and said it was kind of milky. So funny! that is like ordering slamon and saying it's too fishy... It was okay ice cream but you could tell it was scooped right from a store bought container. When the bill was dropped we decided that the food was alright but it's not worth the prices they charge here. next time I'm going to a hole in the wall Japanese place with the old japanese lady in the corner reading the newspaper and sipping on tea! :)"}

First, my party and I went to this restaurant for Happy Hour and was told that there was not enough room for us to indulge in the Happy Hour festivities as only those sitting in the bar and patio area were privy and both aforementioned areas were full. We then managed to talk to the manager and sit at a regular booth and enjoy Happy Hour drinks and food. The first drink given to our table was supposed to be a Jack's Honey Peach Tea, but upon receiving the drink, it should have been called Pink Sludge. The drink was full of clumps of an unknown sticky substance. The waiter's two explanations was that it could have been either fruit pulp or egg whites in the cocktail. The drink's description did not mentioned fruit pulp or egg whites. So, with that being said, there has to be a problem with cleanliness. The food was mediocre at best. I will say the waiter was very charismatic and took care of my party and I. As a result of this experience I ended up with food poisoning and multiple trips to the toilet to throw up.

He was fun, skillful, and entertaining. The highlight of our evening. The server in the bar area was super friendly and helpful. And the (California Poppers) appetizer we ordered while waiting for out table was pretty tasty. Cheap (both meanings) sake during happy hour too. However, everything else about our experience was "meh" at best.

The dour-faced greeters didn't do much to foreshadow a good evening. And their "lackluster" temperament is the word I would use to describe most of our experience that night at Benihana.

The bartender was content to stare blankly into the distance; and the selection of beers was equally as drab as her personality. If I had it my way we would have walked out already. I could just tell from the attitude of the staff that this isn't an establishment that prides itself on...much anything at all. If the staff isn't excited (or even trying to fake it), then that speaks volumes about the quality of everything the restaurant does.

The food was edible. That's about it. Not very flavorful. Boring. They give you dipping sauces, but even these weren't fantastic. The "show" of our food being cooked was nice, and Scott was great, but the food was not. I've had better meals at national family restaurant chains...and at less than a quarter of the price.

What's the point of this Benihana? Is it supposed to be a place you try once to see the show? Cool. Done. No need to come back. Or is supposed to be a place where the food and service is so great that I can't wait to return? If so, they've got some serious work to do."}

When we arrived at 7 o'clock sharp and asked about our reservations we were swiftly seated to a VIP table with our flowers beautifully sitting on it. We were attended to immediately and after viewing the menu I decided on some prime rib and lobster with a loaded baked potato and mixed vegetables while my wife ordered the filet mignon and Parmesan mashed potatoes with port mushrooms. Now here's where it gets good they informed me they were out of prime rib bummer that is why I came, then they came back and told me Molly had saved a piece of prime rib for me thinking that I may order it,does anybody do that nowadays what a thoughtful young lady I was so impressed. Anyhow the prime rib was giant and delicious,loaded baked potato quality good ,lobster tail was just what you would expect very good. My wife's fillet mignon melted in her mouth and the Parmesan baked potatoes were also very good, port mushrooms and mixed vegetables were delicious and our whole dining experience was brought together with a beautiful piece of big daddy lemon cake on a plate that said happy anniversary spelled out in different flavors which me and my wife enjoyed immensely thank you so much Firebirds for making my 35th anniversary one I will never forget we will be back for our 36th.

I have been to several in various states.  The atmosphere is great, food tastes good and the servers are very attentive.  My waitress called me "mommy" and was very sweet.  When I went to the other side of the restaurant she saw me walking and they had just mopped the area and she ran over to me saying "be careful mommy".  How cute is that?  My husband, son, his girlfriend and I went for dinner and had a great time.  They took my son's and girlfriends picture because it was a special occasion for them.  We ordered filet, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The only complaint I have is their drinks are weak and extremely pricey.  I don't mind paying more for a good drink but theirs were definitely lacking.   Their food is also overpriced but it is always a fun time having your food cooked for you as you sit around the table and are entertained by the chef.   We will be back.......................

As I was once again refused by them to honor my bday coupon...he stated we can't do it for a cash value. I don't want cash value, I want my money I already paid refunded for the amount I should have saved using my coupon.

We were not seated until 6:15 pm and that really is not a big deal, however, we did not see any drinks until almost 7 pm.  Our food order was taken about 7:10 pm.

I sat and watched my tiny little yellowtail roll die in the window for almost 30 minutes while the waiter was missing in action.  He would disappear for a minimum of 15 minutes at a time.

The soup and salad finally came.  The soup was barely luke warm.  It was so full of fried onion strips that I could not force it down.  The broth was very bland and the mushrooms were raw due to the cold temperature. The salad dressing was terrible, as well.  It was like cold shredded ginger root with a dash of sugar and vinegar.

Our teppan chef was a big dud.  He was very robotic and disinterested.  The food was only mediocre.  Nothing like what Benihana used to be.  I ordered the Land and Sea, which is filet mignon and scallops.  The dish was just over $38 and I received 5 tiny little scallops no bigger around than a quarter.  I was very disappointed as was my dining companion.

I will not make the mistake of going to this place again.  It was over $100 for two people for very mediocre food and terrible service.

We did not get out of the place until after 8:30 pm."}

Why do I keep coming back? Certainly not the food nor the high price.  I come here because of the show that keeps the kids entertained and allows the adults to hang out for a leisurely two hour dinner.  Depending on your chef, the experience can be less than stellar.  We were lucky to have a true entertainer, Kevin, who added another star to this review.  

Reservations for 11 at 730pm, we were seated at 750pm.   Service was very slow, as usual .  We ordered salmon, lobster, shrimp, steak, scallops, chicken, fried rice along with the soup, salad, edamame, and green tea.  Ginger and mustard sauces were given to everyone.   The tap water is not filtered or the filter needs to be changed.  They provide lemon wedges to mask the taste.  The lobster, as usual, was tough and chewy.  The salmon comes out overcooked due to the high heat of the grill.  The fried rice, mushrooms, and onions were all tasty having been spiced up with Salt, pepper, butter, and soy sauce.  

I ordered sherbet, the server made sure to tell me there was an additional charge.   Our bill was in excess of $450 dollars.    We were  overcharged, they charged us for my sons meal twice. 

Food / service 2.5 stars 
Kevin / chef / entertainer 4 stars
Cost 2 stars

I keep coming back though."}

They have shoved as many tables in this restaurant they could. You could hear the table next to you chewing their rice.

Keep in mind this is the kind of place that is not cheap, however there are more affordable choices if you look for them. 

This location is pretty good however the waitresses are slow to refill drinks. You sometimes have to ask for refills because the waitresses are off talking to each other. Also I would suggest making reservations when you go. It is hit and miss crowded. Sometimes you go on a random Tuesday night and it's a 2 hour wait sometimes you can just walk in and sit down. If you make a reservation you aren't always seated right away, you typically have to wait at least 10 minutes, which is better than 2 hours. 

The food is excellent, I recommend the seafood diablo dish and its only about 20 bucks! Its has scallops, shrimp,calamari, veggies and noodles. It is a little spicy but you can ask for them to not put on the sauce that makes it spicy. 

Our chef was Scott and he happened to be the head chef. He was amazing and hilarious, unlike any chef we have had before. 

To top it off, if you sign up on their website you get $30 to spend there on anything! AWESOME!"}

I've had the salmon in the past, and the burgers which were both pretty good.  Minus 1 star for just "good" food.

There used to be a majestic 340-class bull elk overlooking the main dining area- loved to see him when I visited.  Was told by the server that someone wrote a letter to corporate that they were offended by him, so they took him away.  Why do we let a small group of professional whiners diminish our lives like this?   Bring the elk out of storage- stand up for something.  When our table heard this we were all upset.

I called a florist to deliver flowers to Firebirds they were more than happy to take them and keep them in a cooler nice and fresh for our dinner table. One of the things that impressed me the most was I called in a half hour before our reservation and asked if they were serving prime rib I spoke to a woman named Molly and she told me yes they did. When we arrived at 7 o'clock sharp and asked about our reservations we were swiftly seated to a VIP table with our flowers beautifully sitting on it. We were attended to immediately and after viewing the menu I decided on some prime rib and lobster with a loaded baked potato and mixed vegetables while my wife ordered the filet mignon and Parmesan mashed potatoes with port mushrooms. Now here's where it gets good they informed me they were out of prime rib bummer that is why I came, then they came back and told me Molly had saved a piece of prime rib for me thinking that I may order it,does anybody do that nowadays what a thoughtful young lady I was so impressed. Anyhow the prime rib was giant and delicious,loaded baked potato quality good ,lobster tail was just what you would expect very good. My wife's fillet mignon melted in her mouth and the Parmesan baked potatoes were also very good, port mushrooms and mixed vegetables were delicious and our whole dining experience was brought together with a beautiful piece of big daddy lemon cake on a plate that said happy anniversary spelled out in different flavors which me and my wife enjoyed immensely thank you so much Firebirds for making my 35th anniversary one I will never forget we will be back for our 36th.

We've been to this location twice and the food was great both times. Shizuka was amazing. We never had to wait for drinks the entire night. Jorge's food was great, but his show was the best. My wife and I have had Hibachi many times before, but his performance was outstanding. We went to the one in Scottsdale first, but the one in Chandler is much better if you get the right people. Jorge made us feel like we were at a table with friends, rather than being served. Well done, and we'll be back."}

Our waitress was sweet and attentive however the food wasn't worth the prices we paid per meal 
I paid 22 dollars for a small streak and potato 
First time around I sat and watched my family eat while my Steak was being recooked ( super raw the first time ) 
Salad was extra
My steak was a bit tough  and dry on the outside however pretty good otherwise    
The  small potato had a ton of salt crusted on the skin 
Pretty to look at but way to salty  
No garnish on the plate at all , plain presentation 
My daughter ordered the scallop potato with her steak and  it was super spicy , yuk 
We paid extra for the salad and it was pretty good other than the super hard bacon bits 
My youngest enjoyed her kids meal and my husband was okay with  his meal however for 30 bucks you would think he would  get a larger potato...  
My oldest daughter wasn't thrilled from the get go 
The spicy potatoes and hard bacon bits in her salad put her off of everything 
I wouldn't recommend to families with young children 
Sadly we won't be returning"}

Okay!  We had reservations at 1:30 for a party of 8 for lunch and still had about a 20 minute wait.  To be fair though two of our party were late but still our table should have been ready when they arrived.  It wasn't.

Once we were seated the experience began and an amazing experience it was.  We were surprised the lunch prices weren't as much as we expected.  Service was excellent.

We were entertained by the Japanese cook preparing our food at our table.  He had a super personality, amazing skills and knew what he was doing when it came to preparing delicious food.

The food?  It was absolutely delicious.  As a matter of fact, their filet mignon was probably the best steak I've ever had in my life.  It was tasty, delicious and extremely tender.

Not only were we served amazing food, we were also entertained through our whole meal.  It was an amazing experience and we loved every minute of it.  I can hardly wait until we can go back again!!"}

The table next to us was seated 10 minutes after we were, and they got their drinks, soup, salad, and food before us.  They also left 40 minutes before our table did.

Our waiter apparently failed at being a chef, and decided to try his luck serving.  He didn't know the menu, he asked me three times about the Salmon Nigiri that I ordered, twice confusing it for sake.  It's a Japanese restaurant, you'd think he'd have basic sushi nailed down.    Instead of serving his single table, he was singing happy birthday to a few other groups.  The fried rice was literally....fried.

Afterwards I spoke with the Manager.  I'm usually not one to complain, and I wasn't rude or anything, but just wanted to bring up the situation to management.  He wasn't surprised at all, and even told me that he knew this particular server was lagging...horribly.  For the life of me I can't figure out why NO ONE stepped in to help the poor guy throughout our 2 HOUR dinner fiasco.  No trainer, no help, nada.

I can tell you I won't be back until I get my free birthday meal, but even then, for the price I'll pay just for my spouse's meal, I'll consider a number of places before stopping here again."}

I've eaten plenty of filets in my time and no one has ever asked me to butterfly my filet.  I agreed and asked for med well.  That was a complete mistake!  My steak was like a piece of over done thin piece of cardboard with an overdose of salt on top.   Someone else In my party ordered the salmon that required a knife to cut it because it was still raw inside... gross!   The only thing that was enjoyable crab queso as our appetizer and the fudge brownie at the end.

Unfortunately, they tried fitting us on a corner of an already full table. I am short and petite, but my boyfriend (who was celebrating his birthday) is 6'5 and over 300 pounds. We did not fit well in that corner and felt cramped.

Our waitress was nice, the chef was entertaining and skilled, and the food was delicious (especially for how picky my boyfriend is). The chef cooked everything perfectly. There were times that refills took too long to come through and other random requests because our waitress seemed overwhelmed. Our chef even had to call for her.

We finished off with some ice cream and an acapella version of Happy Birthday (because there were no available singers). We did not get our picture taken nor did our waitress ever come back so I could ask her about it. I was disappointed.

I will come back, as this location is nicer than Scottsdale's, but the service was below average. Please improve!"}

It's also a guarantee of some good food. It's not spectacular per say but the spectacle of watching your food get cooked in front of you is worth it. There are many simple ingredients and the recipes are straight forward. The meat and seafood are of a good standard.
The dishes are classic tepanyaki/hibachi. Similar food can of course be found in smaller independent japanese and east asian places. Tasty and colorful but not necessarily novel. Their sushi and sashimi selection is good and a nice addition to their menu choices. Service is attentive and polite and the restaurant looks fine. Prices are reasonable for this type of place. All in all it's a nice place to go out to once in awhile. If you have never tried this type of dining then it's a must go at least once!"}

We had a company team dinner here and I'm always game for a free meal. So what the heck. 

Walked in and there's a small hostess stand with the bar just in sight which makes it very inviting. The dining room reminds me of lodge with a big deer head hanging on the wall staring at you. The place was packed on a Tuesday night and loud. People just talking and having a good time. Didn't see lots of kids so I would say it one of those adult type restaurants. 

Anyways, I had the prime rib. They only serve 12 or 16 oz. Thick piece a meat that was cooked really good. Let's say perfectly cooked with very little fat. Just how I like it. So tender and juicy. Really good prime rib. It came with a fully load baked potato. It had butter, cheese, bacon, green onions and I had mine without sour cream. Baked potato was really good except I'm one of those guys that eat the whole potato including the skin. They put a ton of salt on the skin so if you don't brush off some of that salt then it can be a little too much. This was a really good dinner with a big portion. 

We had 11 people in our dinner party and they were pretty good in welcoming us, getting us our drinks and refilling our drinks. Took awhile for them to take our order, bring us our food, and bringing the check. Little slow but I think that was okay because Firebirds is a place to relax and have a good conversation at your table. 

Now I know about Firebirds and they have a nice menu beside steak which includes fish, pasta, sandwiches, and salads. Good variety. I'll probably be back to bring my family. Enjoy and Cheers."}

We told our server that it was our anniversary and she made it special by putting two candles on our dessert. I thought it was very sweet and thoughtful. 

I love the interior too. Wood and beams with an inviting feel. The bar is awesome and makes you just want to hang out there for hours. I love all the glistening bottles on the wall. 

On to the food: My husband's meal was OMG delicious! It was pasta with braised beef, spinach, cheese sauce with a hit of spicy. Comfort food at its finest. I had the filet kabob with roasted veggies and mashed potatoes. It was very good, but I should have been more adventurous in my selection. Like I said, my husbands dish was to die for. 

Dessert was just as yummy as the meal. Try the crime brûlée cheesecake!  So danged good. 

As we were getting ready to leave, the manager stopped by to say hello. Nice touch! We will likely go back in a few months when family is in town. This is a special occasion place for us and we love it that way."}

We were baffled why she would be mad for upping the bill. Then, to top it all off, the GM is an arrogant ass who obviously hates his life. Justin, Jason, something like that. He proceeded to talk in bad taste about his staff to our entire table, essentially saying they were all worthless and if he were doing everything, there would be no excruciating wait times, undercooked/raw shrimp being served... shall I go on? We mentioned one of the burgers was extremely overcooked and he said, "well, we're not exactly known for our burgers" and walked away.

I cannot wait to go back.  I also noticed they had a huge drink list.  I did not drink any alcoholic beverage that evening but when I go back I plan to try one of their fun tropical drinks.

What is the meaning behind throwing shrimp tails into your hat and front left pocket?  Am I still writing coherently (he'll check later anyway)?  When did my daughter fall asleep on my shoulder?  Is my grandmother-in-law going to pay even though we came for her birthday?  When will the check come?  Answers: definitely, 2/3rd of the bottle, not really, probably, also probably, who knows, also who knows, a little after her bed time but before finishing her homework, she tried, and soon."}

Firebird's is really an upscale steak house.  And a very good one.  Over the years the food consistently has been good, and the service friendly and attentive.  The steak au poivre is not to be missed!  If you haven't tried it, you should.  They also have a fresh-squeeze lemonade that is excellent (which is helpful if you have to go back to work, or just don't want alcohol).  

And their table bread is very good.  I have learned that they actually import it from Italy.  Having been to Europe I can say that European bread is dramatically better than American bread.  I've been told it's because the Europeans have a different variety of wheat than we do.  So their breads are different, and I think much better.  Try Firebird's bread without butter, even just a bite or two, to experience the difference.

On this particular occasion I tried the Delmonico.  Though as it was lunch time I opted for the Delmonico sandwich instead of the full entree plate.  This actually is more difficult to do well since one usually bites a sandwich instead of using a steak knife on it.  So it needs to be very tender to work.  And it was.  The seasoning was subtle but good, and it was tender enough that I didn't need to pull and tear with my teeth to get a bite.  Once again, Firebird's did it right.

My side was the steak fries.  Cut large, skin-on.  They were very basic (no seasoning except a little salt), but cooked perfectly.  Light crunch on the outside, tender inside.

My wife had the spinach salad and a bowl of chili (their "soup of the day" this day).  She really liked both.  I sampled the chili and agree it was very good.

Chandler Firebird's continues to perform very well."}

My cousin comes here every year for his birthday and suggested it when I was in town.

Upon entering, we were told that there would be a 2 hour wait (not sure if this is the norm, but it was around 7 PM on a Sunday) so we decided to seat ourselves in the lounge, which was relatively empty. A server came to us soon after we sat down, which was nice.

My cousin and I got sushi for ourselves and I ordered hibachi chicken rice, chicken yakisoba meal, and rainbow and salmon rolls to take home to my family. At the restaurant, we had the crunchy roll, spider roll, 1964 roll, and Gotham roll. The crunchy roll was by far the best; the Gotham roll was okay but not especially fresh-tasting or flavorful. I was not a huge fan of the other two.

My take-home order was placed on a piece of paper which they rewrote to confirm when the bill was brought to me. I had asked for two orders of the hibachi chicken rice which was also indicated on the paper written by the server but only one was brought out. I was not charged for the second one (which was my fault because I didn't check the receipt clearly and assumed the order was correct based on the paper they wrote). However, it didn't take them long to bring the second one out, even though they kind of had an attitude about it.

My father was disappointed in the rice; brother said the yakisoba was good but the soup that came with the meal was simply terrible. He took one sip and wanted to throw the rest out. Mom was okay with her sushi except... the salmon roll had a TON of bones in it. To me, this is unacceptable. I understand finding an occasional bone in a fish dish but having so many bones in a simple roll is terrible to me.

Would have given 3 stars, because service throughout the meal was good and the food was okay. Removed a star due to all the bones found in the salmon roll."}

For the fourth time in a row, our certificates have gone unused as 
Benihana has put so many restrictions on redemption of the certificate, that we've not been able to use them. They are only hurting themselves with these restrictions. As an example, we have friends go with us when we go to eat there. However, the friends work and it is just not convenient for them to go out on a work night (Monday through Thursday - the only days the certificate is viable). So, there are three meals that would be purchased at full price and one meal discounted for the certificate that they are losing out on. It is far worse for my birthday in December as there are so many special holiday evenings that are not available along with the no Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays. We've also tried a few days in advance to make reservations and they are booked solid - especially in December, so planning a meal there has to be made several days to a week in advance; tough to do, especially during holiday season. Without the certificate, we find it is just too expensive to eat there, so we don't. After the second or third time, the cook's routine gets old, so we (used to) go essentially for the food. In the past few years, we've found the food and service at the Chandler location to be hit or miss - certainly not what one would expect for the prices being charged. Be prepared to spend a lot of money without assurance of a good meal or a good time should you decide to go to this establishment."}

I decided it would be fun to suprise my five year old daughter with a new experience - Benihana's! I talked up the place all the way there - they will cook the food in front of us and do tricks - you won't beleive it! Her eyes were so big as we walked in and I couldn't wait to see her amazement at the show and food. 

I was shocked to see that the kid's chicken lunch was $11 and my chicken and shrimp was $15 on the lunch menu. The entire meal (no alcohol included) was $40. There are so many more affordable tasty options in this area! What a waste!!!

Now, part of the bad experience was not entirely the restaurant's fault. There were three spooky teenage boys at our table that were looking for trouble. They were yelling at the staff and being very rude. Part of my review of two stars is because the restaurant never asked them to quiet down or leave. They were yelling at the poor lady that made our food thru the entire meal, "cook it all the way thru. don't put any spices on it. don't burn it!" Then, every few minutes, they would go stand behind people at other tables to watch how their food was prepared. Every protective bone in my body was on guard with these little punks. Why wouldn't the restaurant ask them to leave?

SO, the lady that did the tricks was very underwhelming. I am not sure if she was always this way, or just this way because of the spooky boys at our table. Either way, it was a terrible experience and I will not go back there."}

We have been to other Benihana restaurants before, enjoying both the grill side and the sushi bar side.  The hubby-to-be and I went to eat more sushi.  The sushi bar was totally dead, and the chefs didn't really talk to us except to ask if the sushi was good.  I lied a little, because they were a little on the warm side, and they fell apart when picked up.

We had the typical warm edamame minus salt?!?!?  How can you eat edamame without salt?  I guess you have to ask for it to be salted.  We decided to take a trip around the country and ordered a CA roll, Phili roll, Alaskan roll, Boston roll and added the Shrimp lovers roll.  

The server missed our empty iced tea glasses on a few occasions (it is darn hot here in AZ and we were thirsty!) and she wasn't the most pleasant person.  

If you have a group of people in town, this is a great place for food entertainment.  Make sure you budget your time, as the "show" and eating can last a couple hours.  

They have their own parking lot, and lots of indoor seating when there is a long wait (make reservations on the weekends!)"}

Here's why.

We've eaten at Benihanas 5 times in about the last year.   None of these times involved sharing a table with "questionable" people.  Let's just say they appeared to be oblivious to the fact that anyone else was in the room.  I don't want loud braggarts at my table.  I simply do not want to see fat parents let their fat kids suck down 4 sodas each.  It made me feel complicit in the poor upbringing of those kids.  There was more, but this was the first time we'd had to share a table with people we completely disliked.  There happened to also be possibly the noisiest woman on the planet in the dining room at the same time.  It made our experience less fun.  

Not the restaurants fault, but it's something to consider.

Now, onto the next reason... Somehow, and for some reason, they did things out of order this time.  They served the soup, the the shrimp and fried rice, then the salad, then the entree, and finally the vegetables.

Issues with this:  (1) Mostly because I am used to soup, salad, shrimp/rice, vegetables, entree, dessert.  (2)  They didn't serve dessert.  It wasn't offered.  Nobody asked for it, so I thought maybe they took the free ice cream off the menu.  We did get ice cream because my daughter had a birthday.  I've got to check on that for future reference.  (3)  My entree, (The Trio which has Filet Mignon, chicken and shrimp) was prepared first, alongside someones lobster.  I was served all 3 of my meats before my daughter's entree was even started.  Before I was halfway done my food was cold!  This is not how it's ever been done.  Plus, I don't think I actually got a filet this time.  It was a pretty crappy cut of meat   

Then there was a consistency issue between the chef we got this time than any other time.  This chef was stingy on the salt and soy sauce and butter.  Which is ok in my book, but restaurants need to keep it consistent.  

Last reason, and this may have been done before and my husband never noticed, but they add a tip to your bill, even if it's just 2 of you.  And it's a small line item.  Nobody points it out.  I happened to pay in cash and they gave me the kind of change you would get if you needed to leave a tip.  Whether true or not, it appears they are trying to get extra tip out of the customer.  And that's bad.

We'll give them one more shot before we write them off entirely.  As I said,  this was pretty good before."}

I reserved a table for 3 through Open Table for 7:30, upon arriving I wasn't sure what name our reservation was under so I asked the hostess. She seemed bothered with her heavy sigh and eye roll that I would even ask such a question. She said it was under my name, then said "come talk to me when it's closer to 7:30." Befuddled, I just gave her a blank expression. I then cancelled our reservation and walked right out. I don't have time to tolerate rude unprovoked behavior like that.  Peace Benihana.

Service needs work!
Where to begin...

1.  Water never filled unless asked.
2.  Courses were not marked.
3.  Bread plates never provided during bread course.
4.  Steak knife was flicked off bread plate prior to entree delivery and we were abruptly told to keep our knife.
5.  Wine was not topped off.  Ever.
6.  Backhanded during all food delivery.

Worst of all, the manager was "supervising" and patrolling the dining room and let it all happen!!!

Firebirds - love the food, but you need to work on your service.  And fast."}

Firebirds is still my favorite chain restaurant.  Mr. M's bday is New Year's Eve and normally I plan something really fun and we go all out, maybe get a suite at one of those swanky joints in Scottsdale, or go to Vegas, or go to Mill Ave and party til 2 a.m., but in 2014 we had a big wonderful trip to Germany and then we were talking about finally buying a house here.  We didn't want to go too crazy and drop a lot of cash so he chose Firebirds for his bday dinner.  (This year he turns 50 so you know it's going to be a party.  I need to start planning that one now).  

We are already like a couple of old farts and arrived at the restaurant a little before 5:00.  Started with the coconut shrimp app, which is always good and since it was his birthday I didn't sneak more than my fair share like I usually do.

I was in a burger kind of mood and just kept it simple with a bacon cheeseburger and some of that tortilla slaw they do that is so tasty.  He ordered the 14 oz. aged ribeye medium rare, and that steak was perfect.  Perfect.  And one more ... perfect.  Absolutely the best steak I've had in a long long time.  UH, I mean we or he had.  I tried to just leave the birthday steak alone, but I think after awhile I was giving him the Puss N Boots big eyes and he would pass me a few bites.  Wonderful meal!  We ordered a bottle of Malbec and did you know if there's any left they will recork it and you can take it home?  I didn't know that.

There wasn't any left, but good to know for future reference.  Our server was ok, but kind of unmemorable.  He seemed kind of distracted.  Not bad.  Not great.  The manager came around to see how we were doing.  I always appreciate that.  

We made it out of there for under a hundred bucks and had a fantastic meal.  Always enjoy Firebirds."}

So I'm not big on dining in large corporate style restaurants. I usually find the food to be mediocre. Service to be fake. Mgmt to be poor.
But...
We were desperate to find a place to eat in Chandler on a Monday night being that most of the small biz restaurants are closed Sundays and Mondays...so after driving around for 30 minutes we decided to give this place a try.
We walked in greeted by a friendly hostess. Seated and greeted under a minute literally; and we were even more pleased to find that on Monday nights they offer half off all wines (except the reserve list).
Our server Dan was THE BEST Server!!!  Very friendly, informative, and knowledgeable.  You can sense that he cares to be at work.  Management seemed to be just as caring. They noticed we needed a box for our food so instead of telling Dan or the busser to get it for us they handed it themselves.  (I can't stand it when I see managers in restaurants pointing fingers here and there)
The food was delicious too.  My husband had the prime rib and I had the cheeseburger (i know, cliche, but i was craving one) and we shared a bottle of Stags Leap Petite Syrah for half price!! Couldn't make it for dessert but maybe next time.
I will definitely return and hope to be seated in Dan's section!"}

Then, only 1 of our servers for our 2 tables came over and proceeded to take drinks orders only for the first table. When we asked her if she could take our drink orders for the second table (one of whom was a child), she refused because "it's not my table." 45 more minutes go by before our second server finally came over to take our drink order. Honestly, the only reason I gave them 1 star is because I can't give 0. Once we finally got the food, they'd mixed up our orders and it was insanely overpriced.

There were 3 girls behind the bar.  The one that initially took my order gave me my beer, but the beer was not very cold, and the glass appeared to have just been washed - it was warm which is not good especially when the beer is $6...  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  After that, and I kid you not, this was the last time I was acknowledged at the bar- mainly because the girl that took my order apparantly went on break and the other 2 did not seem to interested in taking care of me.  My cheeseburger arrived and it was well done- as in over cooked so much the edges were burnt - after I had specifically ordered it medium.   When I needed another beer, I had to flag one of the bartenders down. As I was eating, I sat there for maybe 5 minutes with no one so much as looking at my empty beer.   She finally brought me a beer and was not polite at all- acted like she was put out - no smile, no asking if I needed anything else.  I have to tell you, there were maybe 10-12 people at the bar, and these 3 girls could NOT handle everyone.  Yes, it was busy in the restaurant for dinner, but that does not mean they ignore the customers at the bar. The next bartender that came over to start washing the glasses, started talking to the guy next to me about her kids xmas presents - she had a loud voice and the last thing I wanted to hear was her whine about her kids while I ate my burger.  Well, that is what happened - for at least 5 minutes.  In a supposedly upscale place, do I really need to listen to that???  My nerves had just about had it...   When I tried to pay, I waited 5 minutes to get someone to take my credit card.  With no one paying attention enough to get my bill taken care of, I threw down some cash and left.  I have to tell you, I cannot remember the time I left less than 15% tip, but this time I did.  I could not wait to get the heck out of there.  I was not happy at all and was in fact, very upset and mad at the situation when I left.  I should have complained to the manager but just wanted to get out of there.   Next time, I will just drive thru INN-N-OUT and save $15, get better service, and better food."}

It has the feeling of a fancy/stuffy place but doesn't feel that way when you go in. Attire is pretty casual. My wife and I go here as a treat and have been there 4 times. We like going for lunch. The menu prices are less than dinner, but I feel you get a good amount of food and don't feel like quality suffers. Service is usually good, but we have had 2 times where we sat a while before we were acknowledged and drink orders taken. Once they come the first time things usually go well from there.

The reason I am not giving them 5 stars is the chicken. My wife has many many food allergies. Soy, wheat, gluten, dairy and the list goes on. They are very good at listing her allergies and they take it serious. Her reactions are not life threatening but can lead to a whole day in bed with stomach issues. She is always good with meat and a vegetable. When she eats out we know hers will be more expensive because she often has to make costly substitutions or order a la carte. That is fine and one of the reasons we don't eat out often. I am just happy when she can find good food that isn't a bland, unseasoned chicken breast.

The last time we were there she ordered a chicken meal. The manager came over and explained that she would need to change her order. I give them props for catching the issue and for being honest. But I am annoyed at why. He said ALL CHICKEN is first marinated in a milk based seasoning. My question is WHY??? Isn't it possible to keep SOME unseasoned? You are taking a huge piece of your menu off the table for her and anyone who is allergic to dairy. I wonder how many people never mention their allergies and just now will be learning this fact.

Anyway, despite the one complaint, I like the place and will continue to go there for a special treat."}

We arrived at 6 and our wait was only about 15 minutes long, YAY! We were a party of 8 and were seated all together at one table. Once seated, our waitress came over to take our drinks and appetizer orders.

Drinks and appetizers came out quickly and we all placed our orders.. 

Las Vegas roll
Sashimi platter  
Two Benihana trios
Hibachi steak
Spicy hibachi steak
Rockys steak and shrimp
Kids steak and shrimp 

The Las Vegas roll was so good! Dip it in the soy sauce and bam, party in your mouth! I kinda wanted to just eat the Vegas roll all night long! 

Okay, so the food is pretty simple. You get rice, (either steamed white or chicken fried rice) and of course a protein or proteins. My Benihana trio consisted of shrimp, steak, and chicken with the chicken fried rice. It was a five course meal so we also got a soup to start with and then came the salad, then the rice, shrimp appetizer, our meats, mushrooms, and then our onions. The only ingredients they seem to use are garlic butter, garlic, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Nothing too fancy but the flavor is good.

All in all, what your really paying for is for the experience and the food is just what you get from it. We spent about $200 for a party of 8 so it can be pricey, but hey they put on a good show!"}

IMHO she gave me attitude when i requested another glass and was unapologetic.  as we left..the manager asked how was it folks? i let her know about the situation.  i think in the future firebirds should hire bartenders with some customer service skills."}

This particular Benihana has taken the approach that it's OK to 'burn' this bridge because another will be available.  I won't rip on Benihana as a whole,because the one I go to back home has very good customer service, but this restaurant is simply not interested in return business."}

This is our new special occasion dinner spot. We arrived at 6:30 on a Sat night with reservations. By 7, the place was packed. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. There is no dress code, so you had people from very casual to business casual. I noticed a few well-mannered young kids around as well. I liked the medium-lit atmosphere and tables were spread out so as not to feel crowded. Even with all tables full and people waiting, the noise level was great. We did not have appetizers, but several were tempting. The mixed green salad was one of the BEST I've ever had. We both got the 9oz bacon-wrapped filet mignon, medium rare, and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The loaded baked potatoes were just the right size and a side of port mushrooms went well with the meal. I can say that the wait-staff and kitchen are VERY efficient, each course coming out immediately after the other. So, if you want a slow casual dining experience, let your wait-staff know to slow things down. For me, our meal was the perfect speed (a little over 1 hour). It was about $90 for our meal + tip, which I felt was a fair value."}

My son had the "Be the Chef" experience. We arrived at 4pm, and the chef (Ananda, a.k.a Smile) worked with him for over 2 hours teaching him how to cook teppan style. When I arrived for dinner with the family 2 hours later, I was handed a picture, and my son was dressed in full chef clothing with the big red hat included. I was amazed that he was given so much attention.

We were escorted to our table, as it was just for us. My son came out, did his introduction and bow. He started cooking and really did a great job. His mentor stayed within earshot, but did not hover. My 16 year old had total confidence and even made a few jokes that he had been taught. The entire time, it was as though we were given person attention. I felt as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. I could not believe how much they went out of their way for us. 

After dinner, we were treated with a birthday song, desert and another picture as a family. Even Ananda was in the picture. I was amazed. 
You would think that this experience would be experience would be expensive. It cost no more than just dinner. For my son to be taught and cook, it was free! Amazing!

As a single parent, outdoing the last birthday is always a challenge. This was the 16th, so it was even more special. I would have to say that the team at Benihana made our day. This was a day my son will never forget. Five stars would not be enough for all that was given to us. Benihana Chandler, you are a perfect 10!"}

Chicken fried rice is an additional $3.90 per person.  And they put barely any chicken in it (they split one breast for the 8 people) so I'm not sure why that costs so much, but it's clearly a ripoff.

The food is in the $30 - $40 price range and come with soup and salad.
Our orders were taken pretty quickly. The food was good but nothing fantastic. I realize that part of the cost is the "show". The chef seemed hurried and barely cracked a smile. The entire point of coming here is the "show". Once the chef started, the waitress disappeared so if you want another beer, order before the chef starts.

The soup, was a basic broth with a couple of fried onions and green onions thrown in...the salad was iceberg lettuce with some grape tomatoes, shredded carrot, shredded purple cabbage and a dressing that was a bit bland.  Then we watched the chef grill up some shrimp, it was fine but nothing fancy there.  The chicken fried rice was prepared first, I ate it when given to me so I could eat it hot.

The hostess offered zero explanation or apology for the delay either.

Upon being sat, we did have an overall pretty terrific waiter.  He helped us to choose one of the most delicious cocktails I've ever had, a Coconut Mojito.  Very Tasty!

We started with a sushi roll appetizer which was also very very good.  The only feedback for the waiter would be that he was trying to sell us on upgrading to a better cut of steak, but in the process basically explained that their standard steak cut was crap.  I get an upsell, but don't completely chastise the other product in the process.

The food was terrific, and our chef did a very nice job.  You could tell he was probably new, but it makes sense to have the less experienced guys during the slower hours until they are pros.

In AZ, there are not many Firebirds Restaurants. Therefore we enjoy dining here when in the area. It's unlike many other Restaurants. The food and service is always very good. I consider a cooked to order meal for two costing $27.46+ tip as low cost/cheap! When you add up all the extras at a fast food stand (I will not refer to those as restaurants) the final cost will hit this mark. So why settle for kept warm fast food?

Today, my wife ordered a med cooked Blue Cheese Burger with Sweet Potato fries. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich as it's the best one around. The burger arrived as ordered. My sandwich also arrived as ordered and was filling. 

Leah was our waitress and did a great job! I ordered diet coke and she served refills without hunting her down-great! The Restaurant Manager on duty visited our table to check on our meal. That's a sign of great customer service. We high recommend Firebirds and will dine here again!"}

I've eaten here before the economic crash and it was pretty good; not so on April 16, 2010.  The Phoenix franchise was never quite as good as Benihanas in Chicago or Florida or many other places I've tried but it was always quite acceptable.  They must now be trying to cut costs by mixing everything liquid with water.  The salad dressing has gone from tasty to untasteable...and the dipping sauces that used to be thick and delicious are now so weak that you can almost see right through them.  THis definitely was our worst dining experience of the year (since we go for the food and not the show -- which was fine.)  Forget this Benihana unless you want unseasoned processed-tasting food.  Watch the show through the windows and then go anywhere else to eat.  If you don't know how good they once were and how bad the food is now you might credibly compare it with cheap hamburg joint food but we know what it was like even just a year ago.  This establishment has definitely gone way downhill.  Don't waste your time or money."}

Despite reservations we were seated about 10 minutes late, and when we were, God Bless the server but it must have been her first night. We were stressed for her and patient, we were worried that she'd drop something and at one point she actually did. At one point she disappeared and we were joking that she quit and was driving home!  Now, if you, our server are personally are reading this, don't take this personally- that's what happens when you are new, but the fact that the company allowed this to happen makes you wonder about the training program. Luckily she had a trainer who was clearly a pro and was letting the trainee try her best. But guess what, it was my wife's birthday and the birthday of a girl who was with another family at our table.  It literally took an hour from our reservation time to even get our soup. We joked that we should go get some hamburgers to tide us over. Eventually the chef came out and he was very cool and very capable and did a great job. The food was good but each person got served at different times so at one point 2 people in our group were done eating before the last person in each of our groups even got their food. Then he offered us onions- after half of us were completely done with our meat- so who wants a plate of onions after dinner? So the timing was a bit off and from experience at other restaurants this is not normal. I did speak with the manager and he gave us a fair and greatly appreciated discount. Hey I worked food services when I was young and any new job can be stressful but for a big company like Benihanna to miss it this hard is a mystery. 

Review from 2010- The best dining experience in a long time. It's more like the Jungle Cruise but with food.  Great service. Great (right at your table) chef.

One of our orders was hot wings ,one of the wings was not cleaned well and has a lot of feathers on it ,we brought it up to the server attention, he went in and came back with a plate with one (1) wing in it ?.
We were just laughing at it since we were not really asking for a replacement or a discount ....

From the steak and burgers to the salmon and fries, everything tasted just as it should.  That might be a problem for some people who are looking for above average tasting food, but for someone who's just looking for a nice sit-down meal in a calm atmosphere after a long day, it's perfect.  Both times my steak was cooked just right, the fries were just crispy enough, the drinks (arnold palmer) were made with just the right amount of tea and lemonade.  J's salmon was flaky and his meatloaf was actually quite moist and delicious with the gravy.  

Again, it is quite average, there are no over-the top flavours here, but it is safe and comfortable and the staff is more than accomodating (sometimes to the point where you will have 3 people helping each other with their tables) in every aspect."}

The place was busy, we weren't exactly sure where to order from but were sent to the bar and then told someone will come and take our order. That's how it works, you don't order from the bartender or the hostess. 
We got the tenderloin salad ($15) and the 14 oz NY strip (30$)- this came with a side and we added another side (mashed potatoes and mushrooms). 
It took quite a bit to get our food, but that's expected at a real restaurant like this. 
Taste= really good, price= kinda pricey but we were stuffed beyond belief
Overall= I think this is a great place to go if you have some extra cash and want a great meal."}

My first time was exceptional.  It was a double date night.  We've heard so much about their smoked wings and the steak so that's exactly what we had out hearts on trying.  We all started with wedge salads and the Firebirds signature salads.  They were crazy good!  We moved on to the smoked chicken wings for an appetizer.  They were as good as everyone made them out to be.  Smoked to perfection!  

The cuts of steaks were pretty big so my date and I shared an entrée.  A filet mignon, loaded baked potato and asparagus (I think ... I'm almost for sure).  Everything was out of this world good!  No issues, no complaints! This was about a year ago.  Fast forward to about 3 months ago I dined at Firebirds again ... this time with a large party (10, including kids).  The dining experience wasn't nearly as nice as it was when I went on a date night.  When I dined with the large party 3 months ago we were neglected.  Our meals all came out at different times and took forever.  This time I ordered salmon, my friend ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Pass on it!  Pass on the meatloaf!  It was salty, kinda dry, the green beans were hard.  They could have been steamed a little longer.  

Because I had such a good dining experience the first go 'round, I'm definitely going to try it again solo or on a date night.  Definitely not as a group!"}

It is definitely worth the price in my opinion. And in Benihanas defense. People say that $35 for a plate is expensive.. Remember. for $35 you usually get some seafood. Shrimp, Hibachi rice. veggies a salad and greentea. So you get lots and lots with there $35 meal.

I'm sorry but anyone who cares about cleanliness would have an issue with eating here. We only went because we were treated to a meal, but upon entering realized it was overpriced for the yucky atmosphere!

I will compliment the staff for their polite and kind demeanors, but everything else was really disappointing and the bathrooms were frankly disturbing. Sticky floors to the point where I had to consciously use a great deal of effort to walk, and the sinks and toilets were LESS clean than a hole-in-the wall gas station! Obviously hadn't been cleaned properly in many many months!
We paid $100 dollars for less than impressive steak and seafood that was seasoned with nothing more than salt and pepper and then dipped in bland sauces that were OK at best. 

I admit the Father's Day pictures were a nice gift but after dropping $100 and feeling nervous with how dirty the restaurant and the staff looked, it was the least they could do.

I Do not recommend this restaurant!
Please do not support this place or refer it to friends. Dirty, overpriced and disappointing! Should be out of business!"}

I ate dinner there in a small group, a second group of people was seated around the same hot stove.  Although our two groups did not interact much, it was evident from other tables that there was some intermingling going on.  This made for a fun, lively atmosphere.  There were many birthday celebrations being had, and by the end of the night I could sing Happy Birthday in fluent Japanese.

The cook arrived shortly after our orders were placed and put on quite the show as he prepared our food.  The meals were all oriented around some form of meat, I got the feeling that a vegetarian would not be happy here.  Portions were very large and served piping hot.  Though nobody at our table consumed any, "adult" beverages were available but pricey.  

The filet, lobster, new york steak, and fried rice were all excellent.  Two varieties of sushi that we tried were excellent as well.  A caveat here is that if you are arriving hungry, you will be starving by the time your food is ready.  The only downside to having your food prepared before your eyes is that you are presented with wonderful aromas during the entire preparatory process.  

Yes, the meals are pricey.  Yes, the wait times can be obscene.  But with a reservation for a special occasion, this is a fine place to dine out."}

Their prices are very high and pretentious.  But the steak was a thick sirloin that was unevenly cooked.  I asked for medium and the steak came out half rare and blue in the middle.  Hardly any seasoning to speak of.  The lobster was mediocre.  Tough, not all that flavorful.  Huge waste of 50 something bucks.

Could've done better at Applebees.

Staff was very friendly though, in fact when I asked for a straw, she served my straw on a plate...

The bad reviews are valid and I wish I would have read them before booking. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was good but didn't provide nor ask everyone if they wanted the green tea that is supposed to come with the meals. Also she should have offered the miso instead of the onion soup to everyone that comes with the meals. Other than those things, she was a good server. 

CHEF: He did not seem interested in being there and was distracted the entire time. He kept looking at the other tables or around the restaurant while cooking. I get it, they do the same thing with each table and it can get monotonous but part of the appeal is an enthusiastic entertaining chef and we didn't get that. 

FOOD: Horrible and overpriced. The salad dressing and the sauces in the bowls were the only good things. The onion soup was salty yet flavorless. Like someone else wrote, it tasted like boiled funions. 

The salad was fine, hard to screw up lettuce, carrots and dressing. 

Shrimp: disgusting is the only word I can use. They were not cleaned nor deveined and they were overcooked. Rubbery and gross. See my photo of the dirty shrimp. Couldn't eat it. This should be a health violation. 

The zucchini, onions and mushrooms were not chopped or sliced well and usually are cooked together but were served separately. The zucchini pieces were thick and not at all the way Benihana restaurants in NY/NJ cook them. This used to be my favorite part of the meal in NY but not here.

The rice wasn't cooked at the table except the fried rice. Since when does Benihana charge for fried rice? That's supposed to be part of the meal. The fried rice was cooked at the table but they charged extra for it. Otherwise the meal comes with stale white rice. 

I didn't have the ice cream. Wish they had fruit or something else as a dessert option. 

If you're a manager, please don't write me to apologize and provide a free meal like you're doing with others. That won't solve anything and I'll never return so don't bother. What you should is fix the issues or shut down. You're giving Benihana a bad name and provided me with the worst birthday meal."}

Most recently, I was here with my family for my Dad's birthday. 

We had the pleasure of having Sam as our cook, and he put on one heck of a show. 

You start with a mushroom and onion soup, green salad with a tasty ginger dressing, and some shrimp with grilled veggies.

I ordered the Terriyaki Chicken, and it was decent.

The only reason I'm giving these guys the fourth star is because my mother found a staple or part of a pair of tongs in her salad, and the manager was kind enough to comp her meal and beverages.

Lastly, don't forget to sign up for the Benihana Chef's Table Club. $30 for your birthday; say what?! 

Like I said, there's many other places that come to mind when I hear the word Teppanyaki, but Benihana can be a lot of fun for any special occasion."}

I had the prime rib and baked potato and was provided with all of the fixings (au jus, horseradish sauce, cheese, real bacon bits, sour cream, etc.).  The food was very tasty and was just as good as any gluten-filled meal.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for gluten-free dining out."}

This review is for the Chandler location only.  

The list:
- Service - always great!  Greeted promptly, always checked on and it seems there are 2 waitstaff per table.  (I did have a friend tell me that one time only...he was left waiting at his table but that as soon as the waiter & manager found out they went out of their way to make up for the oversite.) 
- Food - Let them bring the bread!!  Save your "non-carb" moment for another time!  YUM!  The spinach salad is wonderful and big enought to split especially at lunch. (besides...you have the bread!) I've had a couple steaks and the prime rib, the fish and even dessert.  I swear I've never had bad food here.  Always "meets or exceeds" expectations. 
- Beverages:  OK selection of wine (see happy hour below).  The do have some high end wineries on the menu but I find they have good standard wines and throw in a few "odd balls" that you don't normally see on a mid priced menu so try one of those.  They do also have a full bar.
- Atmosphere - can be a bit loud.  Especially if people do not remove the screaming children.  :-(  
- Happy Hour - definately do the patio.  When it's chilly they have heaters and a big fireplace.  The sliders are a complete meal!  They also do (I assume they still do) 1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays!!  

So...don't let the fact that it's a chain deter you.  Give them a try.  I think you'll be pleased.

Cheers!"}

It was the worst experience I have ever had a Benihana and I felt as if I had to write in. It wasn't my first visit, I have been there many many many times. I have a group of friends and we all go when its our birthday. We fill up a table each time. Last year my sister had a baby and as such we've had to adjust the time we normally go. I made a reservation for 5:15pm so she could come and it wouldn't interrupt my 1 year old nephews routine (and he would be in good spirits because as much as I love him I know that kids are emotional sometimes). All 6 people in our party left work early so we would all be on time. My sister and brother in law were waiting in the bar when I got to the restaurant. They had been there since 5 and the bar was empty expect for two tables.  They hadn't even been greeted by the bar tender for the 10 minutes they had been there before me. I checked in with the hostess at 5:15pm and she said it would be a few minutes so I went to the bar to order drinks. After about 10 minutes of being ignored by the bartender, I finally caught her attention and she snapped at me "I'm the only one here in the bar, I'll help you when I can!".  Finally able to get a drink, we were starting to wonder how much longer for the table. At 5:35,  with the incredibly rude hostess, in an almost completely EMPTY restaurant, we finally walked back up and asked how much longer we would be waiting. The two girls had been mainly ignoring the guests and talking to each other and the lone male host. They weren't smiling, or friendly, or nice in any way shape or form. We were told ,rudely, that it would be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes after that, with my nephew getting antsy, I walked up and said that we need a table (in the now still half empty restaurant and full lobby). She said they would be sitting us 'right now'. I verified that it was in fact 'right now, right now, not right now in another 15 minutes.' And she said yes. My two sisters had walked outside to keep my nephew busy and I brought her back inside, and I pulled our other 3 people from the bar (who had been buying drinks and appetizers). We stood waiting in the lobby another 10 minutes. A full 50 minutes after we had checked in on time we were finally shown to our table. Where our waitress asked if this was our first visit. We told her that we were old pros but she still felt it necessary to go over the ENTIRE menu with us and ignored us trying to tell her that we even knew what we wanted to order. We wanted to get our order in so my sister could actually eat dinner before she had to leave since it had taken us SO long to be seated. The restaurant wasn't full at all and yet the waitresses service was still so slow and she ignored us so often that we ended up stacking our own used dishes up off to the side. She didn't even refill our drinks. My sister had to leave without even eating her meal. Her husband stayed behind to bring it home for her. We finally had to flag our waitress down for our checks and she forgot to use my coupon so we had to flag her down again. We gave her our cards and she forgot to run one of them so we had to flag her down again to run it.  

I have a lot of sympathy for service (especially during the holiday season) but it was the attitude of the hostesses and the lack of involvement from the manager that really upsets me. The manager (who kept walking by the hostess desk) didn't bother to talk to the girls who weren't seating people in a restaurant that was empty! The reason we made such early reservations was so that my sister and my nephew could have dinner with us. I know that my group and I have decided to not go to Benihana's anymore after last night. Had it been only one person with a bad attitude, we would have absolutely been forgiving but this has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't be going back.

**Update in response to the company contacting me, I had actually emailed their customer service first. But didn't hear anything back. It appears that Yelp is monitored more often than the customer service email?"}

Benihana's has a dress code which this man was obviously not adhering to but his gun flopping around on his hip made our family (with young children) feel very unsafe. I am surprised they allow firearms in their establishment. We went in regardless. Made a reservation for our family but Waited 10+ minutes to be seated with another family.

For an appetizer we got the lobster queso spinach dip.  It was heavenly.  Mmmmm, melty cheese and lobster... mmm......

I got the Prime Rib with au gratin potatoes and port mushrooms.
The potatoes were gooey and spicy!
The mushrooms were soooooooooooooooo good, andI could definitely taste the port

For dessert I had the creme brulee cheesecake
OMG
SOOO GOOD!

Sometimes when I read yelp reviews I get the feeling some reviewers feel chain restaurants can do no right! How unfair!

I believe Benihana is one such place.
If you're coming for the show, great - I've seen it. You may enjoy it.

I come for the food and service. 
I have been consistently impressed with both.

Steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, sashimi, sushi, sushi rolls, the onion soup, the vegetable tempura, and so on.

I have infrequently had issues with the food. I told them it was unacceptable and it was whisked away to be replaced with more than acceptable food. No grumbling, fussing, evil looks, or exasperated sighs - just a quick fix of the issue.

I have never had any issue with the wait staff. 

We had an issue with one chef once. He simply couldn't get things right, he even dropped his knife. We didn't even say anything, but the manager showed up, brought us desert AND comped our entire meal. That speaks to the watchfulness of the management and their commitment to quality. 

My spouse can be a very particular eater. Yet we have returned time and again here because they get it right.

The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars are the hours (they're closed between 2pm and 5pm right in the middle of MY lunch time), and they can be a bit pricey."}

I had the chili-rubbed steak and the side of southwestern scalloped potatoes. The steak was excellent, prepared as requested. Loads of flavor. Just the right amount of marbling. Oh, and it was huge. As in... huge. Did not leave hungry. And I don't think I had but a single slice of the bread beforehand.

My wife had the seared ahi appetizer and a baked potato. Yes, an odd combo to be sure. But she enjoyed it completely. Didn't even give me a bite.

The service was excellent, going so far as allowing my wife to sample a wine. It wasn't to her liking -- was mine, but I wasn't in the mood -- and our server didn't even bat an eye when she opted for a glass of iced tea. 

A solid rating. I saw many other tasty items on the menu and look forward to my return!"}

We decided to give Firebirds another try.  I made reservations online for this past Friday evening at 5:30 p.m.  We arrived on time and checked in with the seating hostess.  We waited less than 3 minutes to be seated!  Our waitress greeted us and asked how we were doing.  She did not rush the conversation and seemed genuinely interested in us.  She thoroughly explained the specials for the evening, gave us our menus and allowed us time to make our selections.  During this time the Manager stopped by our table to chat and we watched him introduce himself to every table in our area!  The waitress soon returned to take our orders.  We waited about 15 minutes for the fresh bread to arrive and our meals arrived promptly thereafter.  

I must say that the food was divine!  We ate with another couple and all ordered the prime rib with different sides, while I ordered the Filet Mignon.  The food was cooked to perfection, each plate as ordered.  Before our dinner was over, the manager visited our table again (as well as others) and asked how we enjoyed our dinner and if we had any suggestions for him.  

This experience was very different than our last dining experience in May.  So glad to see the Management on top of things!  We will definitely be back and recommend to our friends!"}

Negative: dinner was mediocre at best. Don't order the combo plates as the portion size of the seafood was for kids. The fried rice wasn't edible. The shrimp was over cooked and 4 little pieces was laughable at best. $160 for two people between a drink, appetizers, and dinner was disheartening to say the least.

What I did find was Firebirds.  The only thing I had yesterday was a fruit smoothie.  I was so bogged down with work that I missed lunch and by the time dinner rolled around I was famished.  All day I was craving lobster bisque, I went all over town looking for it.  My hunger got the best of me so I stopped in at Firebirds.  

I've never been but I saw the Shrimp and Strawberry Salad on the list, and I know I had to have that.  In obervation of Lent, I was not eating meat.  So this was the perfect choice.  I ate the bar and had a drink (my usual 3 Olive Cherry and Diet Coke), watch Apolo Ohno get DQed from the short track (that was BS call in my opinion), and I scarfed down my salad.  It was sooooo yummy and surprisingly very filling. 

I think the thing I like most about the restaurant was my meal.  The bartender was very nice.  I think her name was Callie.  She was attentive and quick to bring me my drink (definite plus).  I would like to try other meals.  My only minus is that I felt the prices were a little high for a chain restaurant should be.

All in all, I had a good experience and I'll be back for that salad. YUM!"}

Finally a couple chairs at the bar open up so we sit down.  The bar was dirty since people had just finished eating, and the tip was still sitting there.  I told my date, lets time it to see how long it takes for someone to wait on us.  It took 9 minutes for the bartender to come over to us and say, " I will be right with you....after he grabbed the tip and abrubty left".  Then after that, it took him another 5 minutes to take our order.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine.  5 oz glasses, a total of $14 plus tax.  I saw what he poured us.  I could have bought 2 bottles of the same wine on sale at frys for what I paid for 2 very small glasses.  He brought the 2 chards, and sat the glasses down - in the dirty mess, and left.  I had to wave him over to ask for the counter to be wiped free of obvious food crumbs.  I asked my date how much I should leave the guy for a tip - her reply was - he deserves not one dime.  3 times in a row, we have been dissappointed with the bar service at Firebirds.  After about an hour, we went in for dinner.  We both had salmon and it was very good.  Loaded potato was great and vegis fresh, salmon cooked nicely.  But, I think I am done with the bar....

Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.  
But the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade."}

I love anything Japanese. The culture everything. I really want to go there one day. I even have my own pair of chop sticks in a fancy box. I also love Teppanyaki. I would eat just about anything cooked on a hibachi grill. I would love to have one built into a counter in my dream house.
Now I know Benihana's is a corporate place but I think they are great. Are they the best ever? Probably not. I'm sure there are places out there that could cook circles around them and put on a better show. But for what it is it is pretty good. It is a little on the pricey side and definitely not a place you would go to even once a month. It is definitely a special occasion place. You can tell that from the 8 renditions of Happy Birthday that you will here while you are there. I have heard it so much I have the Japanese version they also sing memorized and I can't even speak Japanese. But I would love to learn.
That is the top tip for this place by the way. Whatever you do join the Benihana Chef's Table Club. So worth it. A free $30 gift certificate for your Birthday month. How can you beat that.
I have been here many times and I was here again last night with my girlfriend and a friend. It was my friend and I's last free Birthday thing. There are a lot of places that will give you free stuff on or around your Birthday. This was the last one we had and we went out with a bang.
Sam was our cook and he is one of the better ones. He puts on a good show with funny jokes and is a very excellent cook. You start with a mushroom and onion soup, which I think is great, then a salad with their fantastic dressing on it, move on to shrimp appetizer, grilled onions, mushrooms and zucchini. Another tip, do yourself a favor and upgrade to the chicken fried rice. Sure it is $3.50 extra but so worth it. The little bowl looks small but you swear it never ends. So good. Love their chicken fried rice. Did I mention I love Japanese food. I ordered the steak and scallops. The steak melts in your month and the scallops are buttery good. Everything was great. I love their mustard sauce. It goes best with the steak and seafood. So good. I usually have to ask for more because I use it all up. Sam did his usual great job of cooking.
My girlfriend had not been to a Benihanas in about 5 years. She thought it was good but maybe not quite worth the price. I do agree it is pricey but it is so good. In my opinion.
I probably won't be back until next year but I will be back. I love Japanese food if I didn't mention that."}

If you're into that kind of thing, I didn't like biting into 90% spice ande 10% meat. But it gets better as you work into it..

The second time we went left me saying, "What happened?.."
When we first came in, they said the wait was going to be 5-10 min., we waited 20 min. I just figured the food was so good that people had to be forced to leave. Wrong. When we sat, the waiter got us waters and took our orders (Lobster bisque dip for appetizer, Medium Well Prime rib 16 oz. with baked potato and salmon salad-with no tomatos for entrees),  but didn't give us any bread at all (which we saw on every single table). 

I swear we sat there for 25 min. sipping water before we got anything. I was getting more and more annoyed as we watched everybody around us receive food. Apparently, some other waiter had stolen our waiter's Lobster appetizer. Why didn't our waiter just tell us that instead of the runner girl? The runner apologized, and I was like okay...but then she left and we only had one appetizer plate to share this thing. Urg. Lobster dip did not have enough lobster bits in in, more queso than anything.

As the entrees arrived, they looked great. As I chewed off some meat, it was getting more rare and I dug deeper, more bloody and the taste just overwhelmed me. I couldn't continue. I don't like being the ass that asks for a 'redo', but there was no way I was going to eat this obviously Medium-Medium Rare steak. Hubs got tons of tomato in his salad which he requested not to have. I sent my steak back and the hubs complained about the tomatos and salmon that was a bit rare. 

The manager was nice enough to give us $20 in gift cards to apologize for the mishaps we've had throughout the night, I just wish the waiter would have done more to make sure we were happy."}

It's a shame what has happened to this restaurant. We have had some good experiences here, but the service has become unbearable. The last four of five times we have dined in at the restaurant we have had huge problems with service and always left really irritated. Ironically this was a restaurant that we used to have really good experiences at when we dined in, but the takeout was nothing but problems. Recently we have done much better with takeout, but now we really don't ever want to dine in at the restaurant anymore. I certainly don't expect any restaurant to be consistently perfect, but after four or five times in a row of being virtually ignored, and other problems, while dining at the restaurant, I think it's safe to say it's more than just an occasional problem, or just bad luck.

On this visit we went to the restaurant early on a Saturday, hoping to avoid a crowd, and hopefully get better service. Clearly crowds are not the problem. There must have been more employees milling about than there were customers. It started just like other visits, where it seemed like we were invisible. Adding insult to injury, we were seated on the left side of the restaurant where there were only a total of three tables occupied, and two waitresses waiting on them. Yet, still no one would come to our table and wait on us. Just as I was about to get up and ask someone why we were not being waited on, a waitress finally showed up. However, it was not one of the two waitresses working the tables around us. It turned out it was a waitress who was working tables all of the way on the other side of the restaurant, and working more tables than the two waitresses combined on our side. We were the only table she was waiting on that wasn't all the way on the other side of the restaurant. Why would they do this? The restaurant was less than a quarter full, if that. 

Sure enough, she took our order, and we began a long wait before getting our food. When we finally got our food, my son's salad was covered in Caesar dressing instead of the ranch he requested. He does not like Caesar dressing. This wouldn't be so bad, but once again we could not get someone to come to the table so that he could get it fixed. We waited what seemed like forever. My son staring at his food, me eating mine, and both of us with nothing to drink. 

Eventually I lost patience and asked one of the many employees just milling about the restaurant if I could see the manager. The woman that I asked was walking up and down the aisle the whole time we were in the restaurant doing nothing but entering information in a tablet. Other employees milling about occasionally stopped and chatted in groups, but no waitress for us. Eventually my son got his new salad and we got our drinks, but we were there a LONG time. I was long done eating but had to watch as my son eat as he was just getting his food. 

This restaurant is managed very poorly. I think most of the patrons could step in and do a better job without any experience. At the very least they could figure out that it's a bad idea to have a waitress come from the other side of the restaurant to help two waitresses who have less tables combined than the one who served us from afar.


PREVIOUS REVIEW

I don't write too many positive reviews about restaurants because I don't really like writing reviews, and I feel it is more of a service to people to warn them about places that may just ruin their day than to just confirm that a place is good which has usually already been done.

I will start with the negative, and the reason I didn't give this restaurant five stars. The takeout from this restaurant is nothing but trouble. We have tried it many times and the odds that you will not have a problem are not good at all. Sadly, though, this is true of a lot of restaurants when it comes to takeout orders.

We have dined in at this restaurant a lot over the years and I really don't think there is a place that we would rather go. The service is usually very good and the food has been excellent with very few problems. Add to this a very responsive management for when there is a problem and it is easily worth four stars, perhaps four and a half."}

Pluses:
- Spacious parking lot
- Fast seating and Courteous staff. seriously, all of them were so friendly and definitely worked to keep their customers happy.
- Food is amazing and comes in generous portions (always the best)! They are really generous about specific requests you have with your order. 
- meats are cooked just right. you know when you ask medium rare for something but they cook it medium or medium well?? yeah, none of that!
- They congratulate birthdays/anniversaries with a free desert/candle. it's sooo cute and sooo good. We got a huge slice of cheesecake. By this time our stomachs were literally about to explode.

Why it's not a 5?
- They have an open kitchen and although it's not that big of a deal (since you get to see what foods they serve for future reference), im just not a big fan of it
- Lighting is too dim for me. Yeah, it sets the mood but it doesn't have to be thaaat dark"}

We both had filet mignon.  Hers with shrimp, mine with blue cheese sauce.  They blended nicely with the soft feel, but robust taste of the Zin.  They brought us an extra bread, hot enough to melt the butter instantly, but soft and subtle enough to taste and feel more like an entree than a free appetizer.  

I've been here three times, and this is the second time that I felt in the moment.  Our last visit was memorable only in it's mediocrity.  Two out of three is pretty good.  I know we'll try for three out of four."}

My fiance and I usually go here in the evenings for date nights.  But yesterday my 10 coworkers and I went her for a work lunch.  I was amazed at how smoothly the service went for 11 people.  Our waitress was fantastic and the food was amazing, as always.

Since I've dined here before I had to switch to a gluten free diet, I'll just go ahead and tell you about all the food, versus just what I ate yesterday.  They start you out with loaves of fresh baked bread and butter.  The crust is crispy, perfect, divine & I have no idea how they accomplish that.  I wish my baking experiments came out that well.  They were more than willing to bring out many, many loaves for the carb addicted hordes at our table.

The appetizers the table shared as a group were the lobster spinach dip, smoked chicken wings, and onion rings.  I, myself, have only tried the lobster spinach dip.  It is hands down the best I have ever had.  It has just the right about of lobster so that you actually can get a bit in every bite.  I did not get to try the onion rings or wings, but they looked amazing.  There was no excess oil or anything to make either appetizer looks slightly soggy.  Everyone raved about how wonderful & perfectly cooked everything was.  I got to sit in watch in extreme envy.  Woo boy.

For my entree I had the Aspen sirloin and loaded baked potato.  I ordered my steak medium rare, and shockingly, it was a true medium rare.  Most places overcook it and bring out a medium.  Not Firebird's.  And it was so juicy and delicious.  The baked potato was also amazing.  My only complaint was that they outside was pretty salty.  But, unlike most people, I am not a huge salt person.  I like spicier and/or other flavors, not so much salty ones.  So I chalk this up to my own personal taste.  It had bacon, chives, sour cream, cheese, all the goodies.

I also have to rave about their pecan crusted trout with peach salsa that I've has before.  I'm not usually a fish person, but I am a salsa person so it caught my eye.  And I ate every bite.  That fish & salsa is addictingly good.

The group ordered an array of dessert combos and there was no complaints from anyone.  They even brought one friend a small bowl of vanilla ice cream because she wasn't hungry enough to eat a real dessert, the wimp.

Best of all, the service was continuously prompt.  Our waitress checked on us every couple of minutes for drinks, etc.  And they delivered all our dishes within moment of each others, so no one was watching other people eat, etc.  Can't wait to go back again!"}

Someone else mentioned s/he wasn't a fan of open kitchens.  However, we do like that arrangement.  It's far enough away to not be intrusive.  The bar has a fireplace that's nice to sit by on chilly days.  

The fresh-baked sourdough bread is among the best served by any restaurant. The coconut shrimp appetizer was big enough for a meal, and the grilled tenderloin salad enough for a male friend of ours.

He ordered 12 oz New York and I ordered the 8 oz tenderloin. I knew what different cuts of meat look and taste like. I meant business when it comes to steak!! 

Our cook prepped our food in front of us, I noticed how each steak has different cut, while NY was chunky and short, my tenderloin was thinner. While I turned around in middle of the conversation, the steak was served onto my plate, and the first thing I noticed was how chunky it was. After trying the first bite, I know immediately that was NOT a tenderloin. Just to make sure, I tried a piece of what was served to my friend, and I noticed my "tenderloin" was chewy and lean (what NY steak  normally taste like) while his "NY steak" was soft and fatty (what tenderloin normally taste like.) 

I brought this to the manager's attention, he came over and looked at the meat and told me that my experience with tenderloin could be improved if I requested to have my steak cooked with Garlic butter. I informed the manager how each plate of steak tasted like and he insist that the fat/ garlic butter makes all the difference. (Keep in mind, my friend also didn't request the garlic butter.)

Lastly, he walked away with "But I will see what I can do" and never come back to the table again till everyone got their desert when they do the birthday picture for the table. I left my steak untouched simply cause I wasn't sure if they will correct my order... And end up leaving the place $40 short and hungry. 

I feel I was treated like a restart and very disrespectfully.  I wasn't taken serious and my concerns were taken lightly. Though getting me what I ordered correctly would be nice (which didn't happen), an apology would be highly appreciated (which also didn't happen.) 

As much as I love tepanyaki, I will NEVER return to this location."}

Well I was explaining on my review earlier, that I was upset that they booked so many reservations that they couldn't seat any walk ins for an hour and half.   Think about it.   No one was waiting in lobby.   People were walking out.   You don't overbook reservations like that.   You always make sure to have room for the walk ins.   Doesn't matter how busy or popular your restaurant is.  That is bad for business.   Unless it's Valentines or Mothers day.  You don't see that kind of response from a restaurant.

When we arrived at 7 o'clock sharp and asked about our reservations we were swiftly seated to a VIP table with our flowers beautifully sitting on it. We were attended to immediately and after viewing the menu I decided on some prime rib and lobster with a loaded baked potato and mixed vegetables while my wife ordered the filet mignon and Parmesan mashed potatoes with port mushrooms. Now here's where it gets good they informed me they were out of prime rib bummer that is why I came, then they came back and told me Molly had saved a piece of prime rib for me thinking that I may order it,does anybody do that nowadays what a thoughtful young lady I was so impressed. Anyhow the prime rib was giant and delicious,loaded baked potato quality good ,lobster tail was just what you would expect very good. My wife's fillet mignon melted in her mouth and the Parmesan baked potatoes were also very good, port mushrooms and mixed vegetables were delicious and our whole dining experience was brought together with a beautiful piece of big daddy lemon cake on a plate that said happy anniversary spelled out in different flavors which me and my wife enjoyed immensely thank you so much Firebirds for making my 35th anniversary one I will never forget we will be back for our 36th.

I ordered my ribeye and out comes a steak looking nothing like the delicious ribeye I normally get. The cut was thicker and had almost no fat on it. No marveling through it. I asked the waiter to double check it was a ribeye. 
The manager came to my table and explained how it is definitely a ribeye. He said they hand cut their steaks and my particular cut was from the end of the loin or something like that. It didn't seem like he wanted to make me a new one but I basically insisted. The next cut they brought out was better in that it had more fat and looked more like a ribeye but it wasn't as good as every other time I've been here. 
If I'm paying $27 for a steak I should get the cut I want. If they don't like that, they should ask if you are ok with getting an end cut because it's completely different from a typical ribeye."}

We have visited this restaurant several times in the past years and enjoy the treat of the teppanyaki. The food is always delicious and the meal is quite complete.

During this most recent visit, we were seated with a party of four and a party of 2. The party of 4 did not realize that we were all going to sit around one table. They were seated along the bench part of the table and were obviously displeased that they had to cram together so that my husband and I could also sit around the table. They were rude about this and because they made little effort to scoot together, my husband ended up being uncomfortable because he was not fully able to sit on the bench.

The meal was good although because I have an allergy, the chef said that the mushrooms would be cooked at the end. There ended up being no mushrooms cooked or served at all. In addition, the chef had forgotten to prepare my steak with the others and therefore I had to wait for it to be cooked toward the end of the meal.

I also noticed that over the years, the birthday treat has changed in value. I remember when I would get a boat made of pineapple and other fruits. Then it was simply a pineapple. Now it is simply two scoops of ice cream. While the meal itself is filling, I wonder if the economy has impacted this change.

This chef was new to cooking and while I'm glad that he is able to learn and practice, his tricks weren't as smooth and some of our food ended up cold because we were waiting to eat it with the rest of the entrée.

The service was wonderful and our server Junko was always prompt and willing to refill our glasses and remove dishes once we had finished each course."}

My service has never been poor, and often been exceptional.  And there are several menu items I rotate through, so they're far from a one trick pony.

Their Delmonico Steak Sandwich was delightful from the first bite.  Juicy with char grilled flavors that cascaded over my tongue, I found this to be a very satisfying lunch option, especially when paired with the sweet potato fries... and for $12, not a bad price.

When my Grilled Tenderloin Salad arrived at the table, it was visually underwhelming, lacking the creativity I've grown accustomed to with other restaurants.  Essentially lettuce and tomato with some bleu cheese crumbles, with a steak on top.  Thankfully I had the foresight to add egg, which didn't really jazz it up all that much.  However, once I took a bite of that steak, I was completely impressed... with the taste.  At $15.95, it is pricey, but the meat is worth it.

The Bleu Cheese Burger is a must try for anyone who can appreciate mushrooms and roquefort.  A delight for the senses, my friend.  For my side, I went all-out Napoleon Dynamite and had the tots.  They were perfectly crisp... almost too crisp.  This was a completely enjoyable entree regardless.

And if none of these options appeals to you, check out their menu, which is modestly diverse."}

The food is good, the service is good and the ambiance is nice. There are moose heads on the walls and ridiculously high ceilings, so it's got that "Classy Elks Club Hunting Lodge" type feel to it...It's really open, yet cozy.  I like the wood grilled options on the menu (go figure), and their grilled chicken is especially delicious.

The ranch rings are um...stupid good. They are my favorite onion rings ever, and they're accompanied by the best ranch ever. So, it's pretty safe to assume that I recommend you try them if you like rings (and who doesn't like rings???). I also really like their salads, which you'll need to start eating more of if you order the ranch rings. Their ribs are also very good, and they make a pretty good burger as well.

The only downside here is that it's retiree central in this place. I don't know what it is about Firebirds, but old people flock to this place like it's Pensacola, Florida in November. If you dine here, get ready to wait for a little while and plan to stub your toe on a walker or two...

In all seriousness, respect the your elders...Also, Firebirds is a great place to get lunch or dinner. Highly recommend."}

Called before and asked if I had to print out or if I could show my phone because my printer was acting up. The gentleman on the phone told me I could just show my phone, no problem. And then I called again because I realized it expired yesterday( before the end of the month like it advertised) and So I call back, again he tells me no problem. I make the drive out, we sit at the table when the server tells me it has to have a bar code.. the coupon they emailed to me did not contain a barcode, and the manager then tells me because its expired. None of this was explained when I clearly did my part, calling ahead, asking before I even bothered to come out. Needless to say, they didn't honor it, the lady we sat next to said she had same problem, so my family made the decision because of the poor experience to dine elsewhere.. (the Chili's next door was AMAZING!) normally i'd pass on Chili's but they changed up their menu, Cowboys game just started and the server was so great!! Food delicious as well..it all worked out in the end. But I would NOT Recommend Benihana to anyone!"}

I think I had enough and it went beyond the point even if I can get a free meal, I won't go back to this Benihana.

This time we went to celebrate my husband's birthday and we had the $30 certificate.

The quality of the sushi fish became worse. It's very watery, tasteless and not fresh but I won't complain much about it as there are many other sushi restaurants that serve the same quality of sushi in Phoenix. I think it's mainly because it's hard to get good fresh sushi grade fish in Phoenix although there are some Japanese restaurants that serve good fresh sushi.

The thing is their service. We waited about 15mins before the waitress took our order although we decided what we wanted to eat very quickly. She just didn't come back for that long.

Then she made a mistake in our order. My husband said "Sushi and Sashimi combo". She repeated the order as "Sushi combo (without sashimi)". So my husband corrected "No, not Sushi combo, I would like to have Sushi and Sashimi combo" and pointed out the item in the menu. She said "okay". 

But.....yes, she brought the small "Sushi combo" instead of "Sushi and Sashimi combo". I told her it's not what my husband ordered. And surprisingly, she said " I thought you ordered Sushi combo"....and seemed she just wanted him to eat that. Hmmmm she "thought"..... So I told her my husband already corrected her mistake once by pointing out it in the menu. Then she said "There must be some misunderstanding but I can change it." I thought " Hmmmm....misunderstanding?" I think it's a obvious mistake, though.

I didn't say anymore as my husband got what he ordered in the end and it was his birthday. In the end, she said "Sorry for the misunderstanding" and I think that is the best we could get from her.

After we finished our entrees, we again had to wait for about 30mins for the waitress to come by.

There's one thing we enjoyed which is the performance of the chef at our table. 
So I give them 2 stars instead of 1."}

I went to Benihana for my annual birthday meal.  (If you don't subscribe to the birthday club you need to, free $30 credit every year!)  I made a reservation in advance for 7pm and I was seated at approximately 7:10pm.  The restaurant was waiting for an open chef table so this was not an issue.

Once we were seated, the waitress instantly came and explained the menu and went over the specials and her favorites.  Afterwards, she took drink orders and gave everyone time to review their menu.  After drinks arrived we began to get our appetizers.. soups, salad, etc.

From the time we first interacted with the waitress until the time the chef came it was probably about 15-20 minutes.  Again, not an issue at all which is why they give you appetizers.

The chef was pleasant and entertaining.  He was interactive with each of us.  The food was cooked to perfection and each part was placed out in order, first rice, then vegetables, then meats.  Of course with any Benihana meal, by the time you get your entrée your rice and veggies won't be as warm as they are.  (I wonder can this ever change in the future)  All in all, great experience and great service!"}

Should've read some of the reviews to save us the headache. For the breakdown:

Misters in the patio keep you cool during the Arizona summer. The 360 misters in the middle should be re-thought out as they create puddles of water in the center of the patio and the puddles attract mosquitos.

I called in 20 mins ahead to see if they allowed dogs in their outdoor patio and if they had room available. The host answered promptly and accurately and seated us as soon as we came in. The waiter was attentive and made sure to correct any issues we had. Manager was also a pleasure to deal with. (More on that later)

I ordered a Tennessee Summer, which came out watered down. My boyfriend had the signature Double Black Diamond Martini, which I ended up drinking since it was too sweet for him but palatable in comparison to my drink.The bread and salad get 5 stars. Boy, do they try to get you with that complimentary bread! You know...sometimes we base a place off their apps and Firebird's bread will surely have you fooled. Definitely thought that the rest of my meal would be amazing after trying their bread. NOT 

We ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and beef sliders off of their happy hour menu, as well as a wood grilled sirloin steak with a loaded bake potato. I had half a grilled shrimp taco and my boyfriend ate the rest of them, we agreed they were subpar. Although they were overcooked, I liked the concept of the sliders served only with mustard. They reminded me of my favorite homemade grilled cheese that uses the same key ingredients: cheese, onions, and mustard. 

Out comes the sirloin with the extra salted loaded baked potato. Had to scoop the butter out of the potato and brush off some of the salt and after that it was quite tasty. Made the mistake of ordering my sirloin Medium knowing very well that the steak continues to cook as it sits on the plate and sure enough it came out close to well done. I took the blame on that one, but wasn't accepting any excuse for the disgusting taste of that steak. You could immediately tell that the steak had been cooked on a surface that just had salmon on it, almost as if it was cooked in the fish's oil itself. Needless to say, I thought about feeding the rest of it to my dog but I wouldn't even give him what tasted like tainted meat. I brought this to the attention of the waiter who sent his manager over and they kindly said took care of it and asked if I would like another plate. 

Kitchen needs to put a more Love into their food."}

I was in a party of 4, and 2 other couples were seated with us at the Hibachi Grill.
I ordered the Philadelphia Roll, Rainbow Roll and shrimp tempura Hand Roll, as well as a Bottle of Sake.
The sake was delicious and had a hint of nutmeg and apple peels.
My sushi came out timely before the rest of the tables food was beginning to be prepared so we passed the sushi around for everyone to taste. The cream cheese in the Philadelphia rolls was scrumptious.
Our chef Christian was entertaining and funny, he did the volcano trick and the shrimp tail in the hat and pocket trick and recieved plenty of "ooh" and "aahs" from me and the others.
I was rather impressed with how fresh the food was and how nutritiously "clean" the food was prepared.
For a party of 4 including drinks and appetizers our bill came to only $107.

One associate requested the steak well done (against our recommendations), but did not like it; she casually mentioned it to our server and the meal was taken off her bill - great customer service."}

My fiancé and I have one night a week where we don't have our children and we decided to spend it at this location. The table that we sat at had an employee who was off work that day, and her boyfriend who was celebrating his birthday. To start off, the boyfriend had his tire slashed in the parking lot apparently by an employee of Benihana over some drug dealing dispute. This was all told to us by the other employees while the two came and went from our table frequently from going outside, to calling the police. 

So then, the police showed up inside to investigate what happened. They were right next to us inside the lobby area discussing all while our chef was making the food. My fiancé and I, as well as another couple are confused at this point and a little bothered that there's so much commotion by our table. 

The couple returns to the table while the police are still there in the lobby. The boyfriend yells at the chef and said he wanted his food well done. The chef said that he wasn't there to tell him how he wanted it done so he played it safe. The boyfriend began yelling at the chef and then we defended the chef by saying he wasn't there and it wasn't right to do that. He then began yelling at us (by the way, he was very drunk and maybe high) and at my fiancé. The girlfriend who is also an employee at the location then started cursing at us, and the other couple. 

The police had to come over and break up everything and asked the couple to leave. The boyfriend threatened us on the way out and eventually cursed at us in the parking lot on our way out. His girlfriend (the employee) was arrested in the parking lot. 

To top it off, the manager came over and only offered us 25% off of our bill! We paid (a little over $100) for something that was absolutely atrocious and I will likely never return here if it wasn't for our amazing chef Kevin and the waitress Shizuka (spell check)! Thank you both. 5 stars for the chef and waitress, 0 stars for the leadership team! :("}

Seated at 6 pm and left at 8:15 so it is not a quick experience.
The food was good but for me.... The teppanyaki experience is old, played out and
A bit dated but i played along.
Our chef was experienced and delivered some tastey food.
Grape mixed drink....8.95 yowza!!  Tasted like grape gatorade.
SHIZUKA was our server and she was an abolute delight. 
Give that woman a raise.....she is great.
They even took our photo at the table and printed copies for us. Electronic copies are available online.  Very cool idea.

It may be time for Benihana to reinvent the teppanyaki experince. Its quite expensive and a bit dated.  Still tastey though."}

First, my daughter and I checked in and the hostess said to give them a moment...a moment later another hostess called my name and escorted us to a table that already had people sitting...no problem, in this type of restaurant you sit with strangers, it's part of the experience. Well the 2 empty seats were on each ends of the table and the host that was speaking to the table already seated would not ask them to shift in order to accommodate my daughter and I. So back to the front we went...thanks for the embarrassment. Next we were called by the host to follow him to another table and we were seated at the same time as another family...thank goodness for that! The family was super friendly so that helped a lot! Now for the food, they had a smaller 'Mother's Day' menu with only 2 sushi choices, both of which I didn't like. So I ordered filet and scallops while my daughter ordered shrimp and chicken. I'm sad to say the food lacked flavor...big time. The cook prepared our meals while he put on the typical show but I was extremely disappointed with the food. I came to AZ from Florida and they have Makotos and Fujiyama and I was looking forward to those types of favors in the food especially for a $84 bill for me and my daughter. We probably won't go back but we will try other Japanese teppanyaki style restaurants in the future. I give it 3 stars because the food is ehhhh and the host embarrassing us made it a horrible start but the nice family we sat with makes me feel the need to add the third star."}

Went for my niece's 18th birthday. Let the staff know of the special occasion when we made the reservation. No mention of it from the server at all. 

Our service was sub-par. Either the server was untrained or didn't care.  When we brought it up to the manager, he handled the feedback poorly.  He didn't apologize or express any concern. There was an adjustment to the bill - but any verbal response from the manager other than "really?" would have gone further. 

Lastly, ordered a different side than what was part of the dish. When I asked if I could substitute, I was told yes. A $3 upcharge was not mentioned.  I don't mind paying more but it's courtesy to inform of changes to the price. 

It's hard to believe that teenagers at in-n-out understand customer service better than this place.  I can see the problem is leadership. 

I give it two stars because the food was good.  Kudos to the chefs."}

As many people know, this can be a good thing if the food the restaurant specializes in is amazing.  Based on that mentality, Firebirds bills itself as specializing in steak, since those are the main items on the menu.  Unfortunately, the steak isn't fantastic.  It's not bad by any means, but it just isn't that great.  I had the prime rib but was disappointed in the lack of flavor.  Something is just missing, and the au jus doesn't salvage much.  We also had the filet mignon (also bland?!).  The one thing I can say is that the pre-dinner bread is really good - so that gets them a star (sad if the bread is their saving grace, isn't it?).  

The service was friendly and the decor is nice.   This overall made for a nice evening out.  It's also conveniently near the Chandler Fashion mall.  The price is on the steep side, but that's not surprising since their primary entree is steak.

Would I go back?  Probably not.  Some of the cheaper steak chain restaurants have better food."}

I simply don't understand the need for civilians to have firearms in places were families gather. It is safe to assume that the average civilian does not know how to use a firearm during a stressful situation , such as responding to other firearm threat. It is more likely that armed civilians accidentally shoot innocent bystanders. It has nothing to do with listening to Hollywood or the media. It's common sense.

If that's all you want to know, feel free to click off this review.  That said, I found much to love about Rudy's during my first visit here.  I'd known about Rudy's for over a decade thanks to a BBQ feature I'd seen on the Travel Channel way back when.  Once I found out they were opening a location here in the valley, I knew I'd eventually end up here.  Okay, it took awhile, but I'm finally here.  On a Saturday at dinner time, let's sample this taste of Texas.

You'll find Rudy's Chandler location on the north side of Chandler Boulevard, just a few blocks east of the I-10 freeway.  Originally founded in Leon Springs, Texas in 1989, Rudy's now has three dozen barbecue joints around the country.  Including three here in the valley (Gilbert and Goodyear being the other two).  Despite its chain status, Rudy's goes to some pretty good lengths to model their locations after their original.  Simple pits slow cooking the meat, a market style counter up front, a convenience store near the front entrance, and picnic style seating to boot.  The Chandler location can easily hold a couple hundred patrons, though finding a table for myself was fairly easy this go around.

I mentioned to the gal at the counter that this was indeed my first Rudy's visit, and almost immediately she spoiled me with free sample after free sample of food.  I sampled the brisket, the pork, the turkey, the beans, the corn, the green chile stew, and even a sausage.  Afraid she'd make me full before I ordered my meal, I told her I was good and ready to decide.  I got a regular half sausage link, a pulled pork sandwich, corn, beans, their banana pudding dessert, and a fountain drink (refills are free, FYI).  Total cost for all of this food and drink including tax came to a very reasonable $20.  

They put all the goodies in my tray (which kinda looks like a soda carrier) and I sat myself down.  The meats were nicely smoked and pretty decent, though somewhat bland without sauce.  Fortunately Rudy's does offer a pair of sauce options.  Their regular sauce and their milder "Sissy" sauce.  The regular is on the spicier end, but far more flavorful than the Sissy.  The beans here also have a little bit of a spicy kick so bear that in mind.  With the regular sauce, my pork and sausage were both quite satisfying.  The banana pudding was a nice cooling finish with a mix of bananas, cream, whipped cream, and vanilla wafers to boot.

So again, it's not Little Miss.  None of the meats at Rudy's that I tried stack up to what Scott Holmes and his staff can create (though Rudy's sides can certainly hold their own).  But I kept my expectations tempered and came out pretty happy with my experience.  The portions, the price, and especially the service I received at the front counter were all excellent.  In summary, an affordable family friendly suburban BBQ joint in the same realm as a Famous Dave's.  Take that comparison however you wish.  For southeast valley residents not wanting to drive to Little Miss for lunch and wait for hours, chances are you'll find Rudy's a respectable backup plan."}

We like it so much we drive out of our way to eat there. We frequent Abuelos where ever we find them including but not limited Phoenix, Chandler and Kansas City MO. 

So for my wife and I to give a 1 star should hopefully get the attention of the owners. We were extremely disappointed with the food and lack of service during our last few visits to the Chandler location. I would bet on it that the management were not there yesterday during our visit because there was a lack luster attention to service period. 

We arrived at 330pm, to find 3 seated tables and a bunch of staff some making eye contact with us as we stood there waiting to be seated. As we stood in the lobby waiting to be seated for 10mins, I turned around to walk out before my wife waved down a waiter who noticed us when we first walked in to seat us. The host was no where to be found but did show as the waiter grabbed the menus. Out of the corner of my eye the host gave our waiter a dirty look, yes I did see that rudeness coming from the host with long black hair. I'm kinda glad someone decided to do her job. But after the food and service, I should have went with my gut feeling and walked out. After all, going to eat at the odd hour has its chance of being served leftover dried out food, but I felt Abuelos was a different place to eat, NOT SO.  


The Pasta La Paz my favorite was lacking sauce, the chicken was dried up leftovers from lunch and had been placed under the salamander to heat then left on the counter to cool to less than room temp when served. My wife's fajitas tacos where not fajita stips but chopped up leftover beef from the lunch. 

We pushed out empty drink glasses to the edge of the table for refills which finally got filled after 15mins. We could not wait to get out of there, we are so disappointed since we loved this place so much. 

We started noticing this on the last few visits, when we have ate there during off hours. Sadly,  I won't spend another $40 to find out if they have change, that was our purpose for our recent visit. We enjoyed our multiple monthly visits to Abuelos, but that will not be the case any longer. 

Hope this helps improve on what once was a great experiences for us."}

I usually order their spare ribs and their lean brisket when I go.  They try to push their moist brisket, but it is a fattier cut of meat.  Trust me..... the lean brisket is plenty moist!  The spare ribs are a decent size, but you won't get much bang for your buck since you order by the 1/4 pound.  Usually 1 pound of ribs is about 6 ribs.  The meat is smoked to perfection.  I have also tried the moist briket (good, but fatty), the baby back ribs (also good), and the pulled pork which was also very good.  I get their Sissy Sauce for my ribs and brisket.  It is wonderful.  It has just the right amount of heat for me.  They also have a spicier sauce, but I haven't braved it.  

As for their sides, the only one I have tried and really liked was their green chile stew.  It has a great flavor.  It seems to get hotter with every bite.  Usually by the time I finish my small cup, my mouth is on fire and my nose is running.  Worth it though, since the flavor is so good.  This place is my favorite BBQ spot in the valley."}

Rudy's is a fun place to go, and as bbq joints go in AZ it is ok.   I have been twice now.  One time the line was out the door and took 35 minutes to get to the counter.  No drink service or anyone walking the line while we were waiting in that long line which surprised. me. 

First time there I got Coleslaw, the loaded potato with meat, and pork ribs.  I think the potato is the best deal in the place, it comes loaded with almost a full order of meat for the same price as an order of meat.  I had the briscuit, which was very very good.   As I have found from most bbq joints here, the coleslaw was bland, and the ribs were ok, a little overcooked.

Second time I went I had baby backs and jalapeno sausage.  Sausage was spicy and good, I am a sucker for a sausage, .  Babybacks were ok, they were pulled out of the smoker a little soon, and not falling off the bone tender.  I did have a couple of ribs on the end that got a little more heat and were decent..  it seems they do not use much spice on the ribs either and were a little bland.

Rudy's staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Because it is so new, it is not a place for a fast meal, but give it time.  It will slow down and you can drop in for a sandwich with out a 30 minute wait to order. 

Try the Briscuit and the pulled pork, I think the best things on the menu.  

Great place for the family to go and eat.  Have a good time."}

The food, left a little to be desired, but it wasn't bad by any means.  The beans were dry, but they can get a pass, they're beans...  The stuffed chile was an odd mix of chewy and mush.  So I wasn't a fan of it.  The rest of the food, was good; not great, but good.  I'll agree with other reviewers that call it pricey.  For the food being offered, it is on the pricier side.

That alone wouldn't be enough to get a new review out of me, but they apparently addressed the problem I highlighted last time.  This time the brisket had a wonderful smoky flavor.  Not overpowering, but very distinctly present.  This is more like the Rudy's I knew a year or more ago.  I'd say today was a 4-star meal, but I won't give them that for two reasons.  First, inconsistency.  Six months ago their meat had no smoke flavor at all.  Six months before that it did, and today it did.  I'd like more consistency and reliability in the quality of the meal.  And second, there was a coal in my green chili stew.  They tried to say it was just a "burnt end".  No, it was a piece of burned wood.  I know the difference.  However, to their credit they offered to replace the stew and gave us a gift card to come back.  I have to give management credit when they try to make something right.

Despite that one bit of wood, their stew really is great.  Perhaps the best thing they do.  Good stuff."}

He brought the breakfast tacos. First its more like a breakfast burrito its big for a taco. Secondly, it was utterly amazing. Apparently they take the left over brisket and trimmings from the night before, marinate it in BBQ sauce and BAM that's the breakfast taco ingredients. I have been craving another one ever since Friday morning when I had mine.

I cannot wait to go try Rudy's for dinner. I have tried Bobby Q's, Famous Daves, Dickey's, and Brian's up in Cave Creek, this was BY FAR the best I have had in the valley!!

However, once she got to us, it was mostly smooth sailing from there.

I think one of the things I love the most about Abuelo's is how extensive the menu is - there's bound to be something for everyone! For me, their enchiladas are what I go for immediately. I don't like red enchilada sauce (cardinal sin to some, I'm sure) so I love that they have not only  a green sauce, but a few others that I can put on top of my enchiladas. Personally, my favorite is their sour cream sauce. Seriously so good! I also had their swirled margarita, which is a traditional margarita with a sangria swirl. Whoever thought of this needs a medal, because it was amazing!

I ordered the moist (AKA fatty) brisket, and the jalapeno sausage. The meat was full of flavor, moist as promised, and without a hint of artificial smoke flavoring.  I tried the Rudy's beans and the potato salad on the side; the beans were great, but the potato salad was just OK. To be fair, I'm extremely picky about potato salad. For desert, the banana pudding and the peach cobbler made me feel like I was back home.

A couple of tips:

*Servings are family style so go with at least one friend, or have a huge appetite.
*Beer and drinks are served in a bucket, and your food is served in a basket.
*There will be families with kids, so be prepared for all that comes with that.
*Rudy's provides everything you need to take your left-overs, and everything reheats well.

It's great to know that I can have great BBQ more often than when I go back home to see family! I'll definitely be back!"}

Nothing was bad, but everything was average. Guacamole had flavor, but texture was like it came straight out of a gallon tin can. I had the chile relleno plate.  Enjoyed the shredded beef relleno, but did not finish my plate.

We brought, Jeb the next day for his own bowl as well. He had to eat outside, but it was early and not so hot that day! Great breakfast!!!"}

You get a tray and you pick the meat you want and they weigh it in front of you like if you're at a deli and everything is a la carte, they have no combos. Meat was pretty good, not the worst, however not the best. The prime rib we got had a huge chunk of fat which we are paying for because it adds to the weight of the meat so I don't like that. Its a chill spot, but not my fav, prob wont be back. Service is good, good customer service."}

I work right around the corner and have been to the place across the street several times and figured it was time to give this place a shot.

It was almost 2 PM when I arrived and I was greeted by someone who explained how the placed worked.  I was able to walk right up and order, but I've seen the line backed out the door on more than one occasion so it was definitely the time of day (I purposely went later to avoid the crowds).  

I ordered a 1/2 lb of smoked turkey, half a sausage link, pinto beans, and a large drink for just under $14.  The turkey was moist & tender but I didn't taste much of a smoked flavor.  It wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't great.  The sausage was good also.  I like spicy, so I only tried the spicy bbq sauce.  I found the stoppers on the bbq sauce bottles to be cumbersome to get an appreciable amount of sauce to come out.  I actually didn't care for the sauce, as it had an overly-tangy flavor which overwhelmed the meats.  I really prefer when a bbq place has the big kettle of sauce as opposed to bottled sauce.  The beans...well they were OK...definitely no pizzazz to them...for just being plain pinto beans, they were decent, but definitely not great....if I go again, I'll probably try the cole slaw instead.

I've been to a few mom & pop bbq joints in Tx and Rudy's does a good job of duplicating that ambiance.  Bare concrete floors, long rows of tables with paper table cloths on one side and picnic tables on the other...and that open ceiling architecture.....I can imagine the how loud and echoie (is that a word???) the place gets when it's packed!

I read some reviews complaining about the wax paper in lieu of a plate....sure enough, my paper split open while cutting off a bite of sausage...exposing it to the table.  Hope it was clean...I ate it anyway  lol  

I'm giving Rudy's 3 stars because I think it's OK, but not great.  I will go back and try the moist brisket to see how that goes.

Good Eats,
B"}

Two sause options, both of which were really tasty.  The bottles on the other hand and the dispenser top were lame but it works.
I liked the sample before you decide option.  You come in and if this is your first time they allow you to sample a few of the meats before you decide.  Great opportunity to taste before you order.
So many great tasting meat options too.  I like the moist beef brisket which is well marbled.  Unfortunately sometimes it has more marbling (fat) that I would prefer.
You get what you pay for here.  Meat is cut and weighed and charged accordingly."}

In my quest for the best BBQ joint(s) in AZ, I heard about this place, I had to try it.

As I rolled into the parking lot, I noticed it was packed, so I'm thinking right away, this must be good, but I'm not getting my hopes up yet. From the outside, it looked like a nice little country store.

I walk inside and immediately I'm looking for the smell of smoke - nope not happening. No smoke, from previous experiences, no taste. Oh well, I'm still willing to give them a shot. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice - wooden bench type seating - like you would find at a picnic in the country. 

I am greeted right away by a friendly little hostess, "High how are you? Is this your first time here at Rudy's?" - Yes, I say, and she began to tell me the process for ordering food - "You stand in line here and you order at the cashier counter." I asked the hostess what type of wood is used. "Hmm, I don't know" was the response - and she proceeded to help the next customer in line.

So I get in this serpentine line like being herded like cattle. There is this beverage trough with various kinds of liquids, mostly alcohol, where you grab and hold while waiting in line.

As I'm waiting in line, I notice the prices, from $1.99 to $6.49 for the various cuts of meat. Pretty much keeping up with the other restaurants around the valley I've sampled. I then noticed something that peeked my interest - a sign that said, "Real Texas BBQ." I immediately said, "hmmmm - I'll be the judge of that."

I continue to make my way around the line and I see people carrying these black plastic type of boxes with food in it. I was OK - easy to carry your food and stuff - no plates. 

I get up to the counter  and I placed my order: 1/2 pound of lean brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and turkey. I then ask the cashier what type of wood is used. Response - "I don't know." Another person was asked -- response - "I don't know. I can find out." My response - yes please. The other person returned with an answer of "Oak." I asked what else besides Oak. "Nothing else." Ding ding ding ding - I immediately said, "then this is not real Texas BBQ, you can't say it is." One of the biggest staples of wood in Texas is mesquite - I personally use a combination of Hickory and Mesquite -

My order comes, and I leave for home to taste my morsels of goodies.

ANALYSIS: The best part of the meats was the turkey. It had a lot of flavor and was somewhat moist. The sausage was a little spicy and had a good flavor as well. The ribs were a little on the under cooked side and lacked seasoning and smoke flavor. The brisket was a bit dry, a little rare spots, and lacked flavor/seasoning and the oh so famous smoke ring - where's the ring. The pulled pork was very lacking in flavor and it didn't have a very pleasant taste. My family - very picky when it comes to the Q, did not care for the meats very much. They did like the turkey. OVERALL RATING: I'm still searching. But, I would say - go, give it a try and make your own conclusions."}

Walking in I felt right at home, with the rustic/Texas vibe. I had fun picking a beer to accompany my meal out of the big troughs that separate the lines to the ordering counter. The wait wasn't too bad, and I thought it was really cool that they cut and weigh the meat right in front of you. I ordered several different items, some for immediate consumption and some to take home. For my in-restaurant dining, I opted for a brisket sandwich and half of a regular sausage and I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket, 1/2 lb of sauced chop, and a tub of potato salad to bring home. The sausage was very good, the casing had a nice crisp snap to it while chomping it down. I got a little out of control with the regular bbq sauce, and I found that it was a little spicier than I normally go for (the have a Sissy sauce which is more my speed, guess I'm a sissy). The food that I brought home was a nice snack for football Sunday, and my fiancee enjoyed it as well (she's also a Memphis BBQ snob). 

This place is a no frills, good ole BBQ joint, that is fun and would be a blast to bring a big group to. I would definitely come back, and I would like to try some of the other offerings they have on the menu."}

If you're dining in, you order your food at the counter. The line can get pretty long, but they have many cashiers and an efficient food serving set-up so the line moves quickly. The line is partitioned by beverages/beverage holders that you can pick up as you're waiting in line. They have the various specialty sodas, pre-cupped wines. You can also purchase a cup from the cashier for fountain beverages. Desserts are available in a refrigerator at the very front of the line. They have the usual meat options including brisket, pork, chicken, sausage. They also have a bunch of sides from which you can choose. Food is ordered by weight and listed pricing was  by 0.5lbs. I ordered few items but only pricing I could remember was $7.15/half pound lean brisket. I thought it was pretty reasonable and remember thinking that about the remainder of the food options. The food itself was was pretty tasty! The brisket was very juicy, and the pulled pork had a very distinct flavor. It was sweet but peppery. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the chocolate pudding, banana pudding, and pecan pie. If there was one con to this place, it would be the desserts. I thought they were humdrum in taste.

Seating options are plentiful and well-kept. When a customer left, staff would come shortly after to ensure the table was clean. They also walked around and removed trash during our meal. As we were ordering, the cashiers wiped down the counter between customers and even the food serving counter was repeatedly wiped. I appreciate the attention to cleanliness!

The employees were all extremely helpful and kind. We were acknowledged at every point of our visit, which particularly impressed me since we were there when it was rather busy."}

There are lots of picnic-table style seatings, some red and white checkerboard table cloths, and a trough full of bottles of beer and soda, surrounded by ice.

We walked up to the counter to order, and from that second, it was a 5-star experience.  The girl at the counter was really friendly, and gave us samples since we had never been there before, so we could figure out what we wanted.  The cook/bbq'er/meat cutter behind the counter was having a good time, yelling back for help whenever people were waiting, and getting excited whenever someone new came in and wanted to try samples.

The food was absolutely amazing.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's BBQ, so don't expect exotic plating, but if you want delicious meat on a bun or baked potato, and want to walk away full and satisfied, this is the joint.  It was too hot when we went, but in nicer weather it looks like they open up all of the walls to the outside, which I'm sure makes the atmosphere that much better.  I can imagine returning when it's nicer out, grabbing a few brews, and killing an hour just sitting in the breeze and getting fat off of pulled pork.

There was only one thing I didn't like about Rudy's, and that was the country music playing the entire time, but hey - if you like country music, then YEEEEE HAAAWW GOOD BUDDY go ahead and enjoy that, and even if you don't, it wasn't enough for me to knock a star off of the rating."}

I walked in not knowing the terrain was greeted by some young man who quickly pointed me in the right direction. After looking over the menu, I quickly decided I was only going to purchase the smoke meat products and make my own sides. Sides add up $$. The cashier was extremely helpful in telling me how much I should order for my party of 4. I ordered 3 lbs. of Pulled Pork, 1 lbs. Baby Back Ribs, 1/2 lbs. Moist Brisket. She had also given me a generous amount of sauce. I also loved all the goodies at the side bar, hot Cherry Peppers, Jalapenos, Onions, Pickles, Bread, forks knifes and extra sauces etc. They even supply little baggies to put them in to take out. So my bill for just that amount of meat was $44.00. Now Everyone knows meat is heavy so price per pound amount is not cheap.

I will say it was pretty good, could be a little more smokier tasting though. With all the BBQ places in town there is a lot of competition. Would I go back? Yes to do take meat if I was in a pinch for that smoky flavor that they need to kick-up a bit."}

I am just a little disappointed that I have lived here for a year and I am just finding out about this location. What's up with that?

I have been a HUGE fan of Rudy's in Albuquerque, NM for years now. Even made special trips to ABQ just to go to Rudy's . . . and now I find out there is one just a couple miles from my house . . . geez! You mean I could have been eating here all along?

I was out tooling around on a Sunday afternoon thinking I was either going to have to go home or find myself a drive-thru because I was just not going to make it until dinner time . . .  when I saw the sign: **RUDY'S!**  I nearly caused a major pile-up on Chandler Blvd as I whipped my little black Honda around in traffic and scooted into the parking lot, jumped into the only empty space and went inside. I could not believe that this little bit of BBQ heaven was right here in Chandler. 

I didn't even have to look at a menu. Pulled pork sandwich, creamed corn, potato salad and a beer, please.  I found myself a small table on the patio and literately scarfed that dreamy sandwich down with occasional bites of creamed corn & potato salad and then washed it all down with an ice cold beer.

Best BBQ on the planet and now it's here within a short car ride, not a plane ride. Heaven, right here on earth . . . er, Arizona!"}

Bacon wrapped pork medallions with enchiladas are another favorite. 

Chimichangas, burritos, enchiladas, salads are all excellent.

Everyone who visits us in Tempe we bring to Abuelo's and they all love it.

This is a nice location, but I do miss the old gas station feel, but they try to imitate it.  Went for lunch and wanted to try the chicken but they did not have any yet, so we went for the brisket.  We prefer the lean brisket as it is less fatty (and makes us think it is healthier!).  Had the cole slaw and beans which were very good.  and don't forget the bread to make a BBQ sandwich with.  Only nit is that they don't have diet DP which I think is against the law in TX."}

Jalapeño hot link (1/2) - not bad, no problem recommending.
Smoked potato (2) - loaded and still dry.  We didn't add meat to the potato and honestly this was the low point of the meal.  I would recommend skipping this menu item altogether.
Baby back ribs (1/2 pound) - delicious and recommend.
Brisket (cutter's choice) (1 pound) - delicious and recommend.  Cutter's choice just means you'll get some combination of moist and lean brisket.
Cream corn (pint) - outstanding!  You will not be disappointed.
Slice of pecan pie - pretty good but doubt you'll need it after ordering a bunch of meat.  I took a couple of bites and took the rest home.

Total with taxes was ~$56.  This place isn't cheap and definitely no frills however you're not going to be disappointed with any of their meat choices."}

The corn on the cob wasn't that good either, kinda tasted like it's been sitting on the cooler then brought back out and re-boiled. Would I return, most likely not given the fact that there are other places through out the valley to try. The price was decent, figure that u will spend about 12-15 a person, you order by the half pound and grab your store bought sides from the cooler.

I recommend the Pescado Guerrero - a wood-grilled tender mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced avocado in a white wine sauce. Yes, I totally stole that description from their website, although I did remove the word 'delicious', since I'd already used it in the previous sentence. Thought it might sound a little too repetitive if I left it in, two deliciouses so close together. Not that this dish doesn't deserve 'em both, it's just that I'm not one to repeat things unnecessarily. Omit needless words, that's what Strunk & White would say. Sharp guys. Not big Yelpers, from what I understand, but still good advice nevertheless... Although, used correctly, repetition can be an excellent rhetorical strategy for producing emphasis, clarity, amplification, even emotional effect. I guess Joe Walsh was right, there are two side to every story.

Oh, and I'd stay away from the Fundido del Mar appetizer. A little too much fondue and not enough shrimp & scallops."}

Speaking of bbq sauce the only choices you have is vinegar & spicy vinegar.

The chicken was too boney, most of my bites had a hidden bone in it. Which is something I'm sure we can all agree that it's unpleasant to chew your food & then SURPRISE you have bone shards in your mouth.

There are no "to go" boxes, you have to wrap your meat in a brown paper bag. Some restaurants do their own thing that makes them cool, but no... meat sliding around in a bag doesn't sound clean or secure.

I must say the quality of customer service was top notch, they were friendly & helpful."}

One job assignment took me by the location every day for a week and I ate at Rudy's every day for lunch.   I am hooked on the extra lean brisket, corn on the cob (swimming in butter...yum!) and the banana pudding.   I love that the meat isn't already covered in sauce because the meat really doesn't need it, but also, I like a very specific amount and others rarely get it right.   I order the brisket extra lean because I hate paying for "fat." They get it right every time.  The banana pudding has Vanilla Wafers as a faux crust and I love the blend of pudding and cookie.   It completely reminds me of what my grandmother would make if she ever made something like this.

I shared other reviewer's frustrations about the sauce and the bottles, but I've gone to Rudy's so many times now that I know how to tip/shake the bottle to dispense the correct amount of sauce.  It's really not that annoying, but I can see how first time visitors would think, "Am I doing this right?"

While you run the risk of sitting next to people you don't know, there is plenty of seating indoors and in the covered patio.

My only suggestion on ways to make this location better would be to make the order placing area bigger.  During busy times, it's difficult to navigate through the crowds at closer registers to registers down the line.  Larger families prohibit access to the salad and dessert refrigerator until the next cashier is literally shouting, "NEXT IN LINE."   I've had a cashier repeatedly shout at me to come to the register as I was frantically trying to get my side dishes and banana pudding from the 'fridge.    It temporarily ticked me off, but the friendliness she showed once I got to the register negated the impact of the shouting.

All in all, I happily make the 30 minute trek to Rudy's just to sit, talk and enjoy!"}

The primary reason? Well, the really good quality food, of course. But more than that, this is a place that has quality food for all types of people. My mother is someone who very rarely eats Mexican food because the spice (and really ANY spice at all) is too much for her. I, on the other hand, like things fairly spicy. Others prefer to be sweating heavily into their dishes...so understandably, the wide variety of preference can be hard to cater to. This place has it all, and did I say quality? Quality food here. Just quality...

...And quantity! Pretty big dishes. Others have complained about the severs but I've never had a problem. Drinks stay full, people are nice and are not hovering over your table constantly. Ive never been spoken to rudely or any of that nonsense, just kind of typical average dinner-going experiences all around.

The decor and atmosphere are quite nice. You really get the feeling you're in some fancy casita owned by some drug lord somewhere in Mexico. Was that racist? Whatever. Its inviting, its a little flashy, it gives your eyes somewhere to wander if your date is boring as sin.

They have their own unique spin on things for a restaurant of this type: ie offering potatoes as an option to rice & beans, monstrous combo plates, etc. I like that because it makes it an experience you're really not going to find elsewhere too easily. Keeps me coming back.

Overall, I highly recommend this place. Yeah its gringo mex fare, but its pretty delicious anyway. Great place to have a beer or five with your meal, and I think you'll be coming back often as well."}

We would walk in and instantly he would have our drinks and greet us with a smile and small talk.

We are very low maintenance and simple to please but for some reason it feels like we're a burden on the staff now.  Occasionally we will ask where John went and the guy that worked with him for years will shrug and say he doesn't know but his reaction is always strange.  We used to love Abuelos but now we are simply displeased with the service and the lack of friendly comfort we used to feel.  They should find john and bring him back if they want to succeed!"}

We used to live down the street and have been here a zillion (at least) times. The menu is expansive, mid-price range and full of flavors galore. While you munch on complimentary chips and a trio of salsas, you can look at the many yummo items. 

We like the dip trio app (queso, creamy guac, and chili con queso), fajitas, Laredo & Juarez combo plates, chicken medallions and build your own enchilada plate. The papas are delish, like Mexican cheesy mashed potatoes. The refried beans and rice are really well-seasoned as well. Our picky toddler makes "mmmmm" grunting noises whenever he eats the food here. You KNOW it's good. If it's your first time, you can't go wrong with a combo plate, which is awesome when I'm indecisive. 

Margaritas and sangria are great and you always get your money's worth with the booze when you get them on the rocks. I was tipsy after one of the smaller size of the house margarita. Enjoy!"}

It reminds me of a Boiling Crab or Angry Crab type of place.  You can eat with your bbq-sauce-covered hands, and wash it clean at the wash station, except this is much easier to clean off without smelling like fishy hands after scrubbing for so long.  

Anyway, you go in and order from a simple menu - easy to read and not much figuring out to do.  We ordered a brisket sandwich, turkey sandwich, and 1/2 pound baby back ribs.  It is prepared and ready to go - just like that!  Then you bring it over to the picnic-like long tables where you share with fellow hungry people.  Sauces are placed on the table so you can pour it right on the table.  But first you have to go to the paper roll and rip off a piece to place on the table.  Collect your utensils and drinks at the appropriate stations.  Then chow down.  I tried the Sissy sauce because I am a sissy when it comes to hot sauces.  I also tried the BBQ sauce and enjoyed both flavors.  But tasting the smoked baby back ribs by itself without the sauce was also tasty.  You can tell that it's tender and juicy.  The taste is different from it being grilled, but just as good!"}

I came with my family, and without someone explaining to us how it worked, we would've been somewhat lost on how to order. Thankfully, the cashier was nice and offered us samples. I usually go for brisket at a BBQ place, but I thought Rudy's was a bit dry and lacking flavor. I'm not sure which one we tried; you can order the brisket three different ways depending on how lean you want your cut. The pulled pork and the turkey were really good, juicy and full of flavor. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Meat came on a standard hamburger bun; it would be nice if it was toasted, but it didn't look like mine was.

With all the sides being a la carte, meals add up quickly. I didn't try any sides, but my family members did. You have to grab your silverware, drinks, and condiments. I thought the Rudy's "sause" (not sure why they spell it as such) was good, but they had a wimpy version with less heat, which I didn't find necessary, because the regular didn't seem spicy. I thought my sandwich was decent, but none of my family members raved about their food. You also have to clean up after yourself, which is fine, but I guess I wasn't expecting that. It's more of a fast food place, I suppose. It was good for a quick dinner, and we were hungry. If we had time, we would've gone to Bobby Q, because that place is excellent."}

The chips served after you are seated are accompanied by 3 salsas (green chili citrus, hot verde and "regular") and all three are really tasty. They're unlimited but be careful, don't spoil your meal. 

If you like beef then try the Durango burrito. My wife always goes for the enchilada trio (chicken, avacado). You get to select from sides like rice, papas (mashed cheese potatoes with chilis), and various beans. The margarita list is solid, and the house ritas are really pretty good. There's a great lunch menu if you're visiting midday. 

The staff has mostly been friendly and attentive every time we've visited- the place is good for kids as they have  nice menu for the little ones. The "main room" has a skyscape painted on the ceiling, so our toddler enjoyed that room. For the quality of food, I think the price is right- although expect to pay a little more than Macayos or Serranos. It's worth it, go visit!"}

The design is fun - cafeteria style and the layout allows for plenty of room, even at the self serve station (napkins, sauces, forks, fountain drinks).  The beer selection was great too - I had a Shiner Blonde I'd never tried before and loved it.

While it was a bit crowded, they were easily able to accommodate our party and allowed us to be seated in the private room. The atmosphere was essentially a knock off of some places I have been in Texas, as was the food. 

On entering the line passes by 2 big tubs filled with ice and beer and pop. The assortment of beers that are mostly from Texas was very interesting to find. The cold salads are in a fridge to your left, but with no signage telling you that you have to pick one up there if you wish to eat on the premises.

Next was the main counter. For those who have never eaten Texas style BBQ, you order by the partial or full pound and it is placed on butcher paper on your tray (or in this case crate). I ordered an assortment of meats including the moist brisket, sausage, ribs, and prime rib. I also got the cole slaw, creamed corn, and for dessert, peach cobbler. I opted to skip the bottled drinks and buy a cup to fill at the soda dispenser which is a lot cheaper.

Upon finding my seat, I found there were two sauces for those who prefer their meat that way, along with some hot sauce. There is also a condiment bar where you can get your silverware(plastic) as well as jalapeno's and packets of everything from mustard to horseradish sauce.

The brisket was extremely moist and easily cut with plastic implements. I felt is could have used a bit more seasoning as it usually is in Texas. Next I sampled the sausage. I felt it could have used more spice in it, and ended up having to put mustard on it to be able to eat it comfortably. Unfortunately, the ribs were very tough, and after a number of tries to bite through them I finally abandoned them to the trash can. Last of the meats was the prime rib. A very nice piece of almost medium rare beef, lightly smoked. While the beef was very nice, once again the lack of seasoning caused me to downgrade the experience.

The coleslaw was nothing special, as it was chopped in a buffalo chopper, but my money is on the creamed corn. What a winner! The brisket with the creamed corn could have easily been my entire meal. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a quart of the creamed corn to bring home it was that good.

Last was the peach cobbler. The cup I was given was almost all pastry, with just a little peach sauce on it. Nowhere did I ever get a bite of a peach. This was a total waste of money.

Other members of our group ordered the potato filled with pulled pork. The portion was very large, but once again, the meat was lacking in flavor. 

On the negative side, about 7:30 the place filled with smoke so bad that our eyes were watering. Apparently, they put out the fire pits at that time, and the lack of ventilation makes it a real problem. 

BBQ is not a cheap meal. While what I ordered was larger than the average person might order, it still was over $45. Quite a high amount for the quality of food that was received. 

It should also be noted that they serve breakfast tacos which are said to be quite good. In my next review of them.

2 Stars for uniqueness and cleanliness."}

I worried about long lines but that didn't happen at 5pm on a Tuesday.  I figured they had a month to get their staff working efficiently.  We were greeted at the door and given small printed menus as they explained that the meats were sold by the half pound, there were cold sides in a large refrigerator case, drinks on a huge ice filled table and an order counter.  They place your order in a wax paper lined plastic basket, approximately 12" by 18" with 5" sides.
We took a medium sized (pint) potato salad (3.69) and a small pudding (2.49) from the refrigerator case, and 2 bottles of IFC root beer (3.38) off the iced table and proceeded to the counter with the digital scale.  Ordered pulled pork and was charged for 0.58 lb of it at 5.79, don't know why they can't measure it out to the half pound listed at 4.99 they advertise. Also ordered beef brisket, the moist which is a bit more fatty but I heard the extra lean was too dry. They put over 3/4 of a pound on the scale and the girl asked if I wanted some taken off, which she did leaving 0.69 lb (8.96) The meats were great, moist, delicious, well smoked, some of the best BBQ we've had. Also ordered some hot sides, new potatoes small 1.99 (boiled or steamed peeled potatoes, chunked and floating in butter.  Nothing special, little flavor, needed lots of salt and pepper, won't order it again.  Sweet cream corn small 2.19 was overly sweet, needed lots of salt to counteract the sugar, won't order again.  The potato salad was fairly good, I'd order that again as it goes well with the meats.  My wife said the pudding (banana) was "kinda bland and I wouldn't order it again".  Total with tax was $31.00
A bit overpriced I think,  They threw in 8 slices of white and wheat bread to make sandwiches with, the bread was very fresh.  There were 2 kinds of BBQ sauce on the table, tomato/vinegar based, on mild, one slightly spicy, they were OK, not great. You could buy a 32 0z bottle for 8.50 if you desired.  Other than the quality and taste of the meats, nothing else stood out.  There are long wooden tables that could become uncomfortably crowded if they are very busy.  I think I might return to buy their meat and take it home, the brisket at 12.98 a lb and the pulled pork at 9.98 a lb.  I give them 4 stars because of how good the meats are. There were pickles, peppers and sweet onion slices available for the taking."}

We had a very friendly waiter but unfortunately you could see because he had our large party of 7 to attend and another table of 12 or more he could've used a few more hands. Our drink order took a smidge longer than it should have but we can deal with that, as far as the food goes.. tonight they ran out of the warmers to keep the tortillas hot, which seems unusual being you have a full kitchen in back? Not only that I ordered the cilantro lime rice as my side with meal and not just once but twice did they bring it to me almost completely cold or semi warm a 30 sec microwave bake. It was so disgusting that I couldn't bare to even ask for it a third time to be correct. The waiter did have the manager come over after he had already informed her the 1st time that the rice was cold but the 2nd time she just gave the fake is there a different side option I can offer you I feel she was the worst at the customer service at least the waiter genuinely cared when they brought the food out cold twice. She couldn't care less. It's unfortunate you had a staff member going to his supervisor for help and back up on a super busy night for something going wrong in the kitchen and she as the manager handled it wrong, I see this as poor upper management and sometimes the managers need to be evaluated under pressure situations because it's unfair when the waiter does try to correct the situation but your superior does nothing to help you."}

I was starving (what else is new?) on a Friday night so I dragged my boyfriend out for some Mexican fare.  Let's start at the door: the hostess didn't look too excited to greet or seat us.  Our server took our drink order, we received our trusty chips and salsa, and got to work.  

The menu was pretty standard for an "upscale" Mexican restaurant, seafood selection and all.  After the server described "The Monterrey" plate as one you could fit a turkey on, I was convinced.  This hefty entree consists of four different types of enchiladas, a chile cheese relleno, chicken taco, and guac... how could we possibly go wrong?

The plate arrived ginormous, as promised; I just wasn't particularly impressed by any of it.  As much as I love food, I am a quality over quantity kind of girl, and this entree was not cuttin' it.  I honestly can't point out anything in particular that I did not like about the plate, it just wasn't memorable, finger lickin' good, or (please insert cliche here).  

When dessert was offered, we politely declined.  Our waiter dropped the check fleetingly and muttered a "Thank You" or something of that sort as he zipped past our table.  I do give the place props on decor, as the paintings, statues, and lighting throughout the restaurant are impressive and reminiscent of the culture of Mexico."}

That being said, I did get the same thing both times and am pretty sure I can say I enjoy their Pulled Pork portion and would get it again.  It is moist, soft, and flavorful all on its own, but I do enjoy drizzling some Sissy sauce on it.  I've also had their corn-on-the-cob twice and found it super plain and not even sweet or enjoyable.. totally blah for me with the corn.  They use real butter, though, so if I liked their corn, I'd be a fan of that.  I'll stick to the pulled pork.

On to their BBQ sauce: I am not a big fan of a few things, mainly how they serve the sauce, which is in a large diameter *glass* bottle with a bottle pourer (the kind bartenders used to control the flow of alcohol when pouring)... no bueno. It took me a long while to get a quarter size sauce on to my pork and it was just frustrating.. and the glass makes it non-squeezable.. and the huge bottle makes it heavy to hold while you're waiting for gravity to help you get that little dab of sauce out and on to your meat... yeahhh, it was that annoying.  Here's an idea: make your sauce fresh and then put it in big ass jars than we can either portion out ourselves (like Joe's Real BBQ) or put it in squeezable bottles (like Famous Dave's)... *anything* but giant glass bottles with pourer restrictors on... puhleeeeze!

Their staff is very friendly, the ambiance is very relaxed and totally casual, pic-nic-style seating and, of course, country.  They have a great concept of huge coolers of booze (beer) where you can pick out your beer and put it in a bucket.. they also have sody-pop and sweet tea.  

Country music on the speakers.... yummy pulled pork... buckets of cold beer... pic-nic seating.. that's what I enjoyed."}

Why, you might ask?  Because I've ruined barbecue in my own back yard that tasted better than the what they passed off as BBQ last night at Rudy's.

If anybody's mother used to broil ribs in the oven when they were kids, well...that's pretty much what you'll get here, except it would be as if she accidentally spilled the entire pepper grinder on them first, because the meat rub at Rudy's consisted of an overpowering application of black pepper, and pretty much nothing else. 

I didn't get any of the brisket, but it looked delicious, so before I left I asked the guys at the next table how theirs was.  One of them said "it's good, it tastes just like corned beef, and I love corned beef".   Now -- HOLD THE DANG PHONE!  The fact that this guy likened his brisket to corned beef, which IS brisket, but peppered instead of smoked, should tell you all you need to know about how weak this joint is when it comes to producing actual barbecue.  It should not be possible to confuse barbecued beef brisket with corned beef, but if there's no smoke in the brisket, I suppose that's what you get.  And if there's no smoke in it, my friends, then it isn't barbecue.  

I was so perplexed by it all, I actually called their management the next day, told them of my experience, and asked them if they thought they were having an off night or if virtually smokeless and over-peppered was just the way it was meant to be.  They confessed to no off night that they were aware of, and said everybody loves it, and they hope I come back.  Sorry guys and gals...not on your life. 

As they say in Texas, this place is "all hat and no talent."  I don't understand what the fuss is about.   Texans should know better than to call this stuff barbecue, and so should everybody who knows what real barbecue is."}

I was very embarrassed. First off, the atmosphere was nice. Very unique! Our service was great but there was not a lot of people there. The chips were good but the salsa tasted like they squirted Macayo's taco sauce into a bowl and called it fresh!( My guest came up with this comparison!)  

My guest had a steak fajita chimi plate that came with rice and beans. The presentation was gorgeous! The cheese sauce on top tasted like the canned Nacho cheese sauce you might get at a state fair. In fact...my guest said that was all he could taste! The refried beans were very bland. No lard for sure! The rice resembled a Chinese fried rice which was just weird!  He hated it so much that he didn't eat much. 

I had the steak Fajita's which were supposed to be marinated.(NOT)! It was over cooked(some spots were even burnt and crunchy) fatty cheap steak. My guess, Flank or Skirt steak! The veggies under it were not Mexican! They consisted of broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, a few peppers and a lot of onions. It was served with a bowl of pinto beans. They were soupy and tasted like liquid smoke! I didn't eat much of my dinner either! 

I have traveled many places and dined in many exquisite establishments. This in no way resembled Mexican or Spanish cuisine in any way.  Just gross and VERY over priced!

Midday lunch not very busy was seated as usual quickly, table was a little messy, ordered our drinks they got to the table in decent time. The waiter on the other hand was slow. Almost to the point of wondering if he was okay to work. We ordered our food and I had to repeat my order as did my hubby both thinking hmmm that doesn't happen here? Before our food arrived we had devoured all of the salsa (which is very good) and asked for more upon our food arriving, well this is where they're losing a fourth star waiter never came back.... several minutes later almost at the end of our meal, he refilled my tea and I said um can we get that salsa we asked for? Without even so much as a sorry for failing to bring it out during our meal he just has a busser drop by with it. We don't speak to our waiter again he just runs by with our bill and keeps moving. Just plain inattentive service and over all the place needs updated.Sometimes the hostesses an be snotty too but they're 18-20 yo so what can you expect. Still giving 3 stars for the food."}

First off, it is not misleading as it feels like a country store from when you first walk in.  

One of the best things about this place are the bbq smokers right behind the registers.  You can watch them pull out the meats and cut it right there.   Then they serve it by the 1/2lb. And will serve your BBQ on top of butcher paper.  No fancy plates or bells and whistles.  They know their BBQ will speak for itself. 

Seating is almost picnic style as there are just different picnic tables and chairs through out.  

Service is always outstanding and prices are more than reasonable.  Definitely recommend coming here if your in the area and even worth the drive if your not.  Also if they haven't sold out of Prime Rib definitely get some as it's one of the best around!!"}

Before getting a chance to order she was plying me with spoonfuls of cream corn (amazing) and their vege chili  (out of this world). She had the slicers carve me pieces from their smoked turkey breast, two kinds of brisket, pulled pork, and smoked sausage. After swallowing I decided to take home a half pound of the lean brisket, some pulled pork, a couple of sausages, and a bunch of sides. Everything was great. The only knock I have is the bbq sauce is only so-so. Fortunately all of the meat was so succulent and well seasoned that the sauce became an afterthought.

Also, the meat is sold by the pound not by the plate, so you get exactly what you pay for."}

To begin, I wasn't impressed with our server. He forgot a few requests and when I asked if I could try another side sauce for my enchilada he failed to mention the extra 50 cent charge. That's a major pet peeve of mine- failing to mention you're going to up charge someone for something is a big no no. When I told him, he offered to take it off, which I declined because that's not the point. You need to let people know in advance if you're going to do that. 

The food also just wasn't great. This was the most bland guacamole I think I've ever had in my life. The three table salsas and chips were ok. Not one of my three different kinds of enchiladas were flavorful and they all seemed to be smothered in cheese. The kids meal beef taco was extremely greasy.

At first I order half pound of each meat and try out which ones I love the best.

and now, I always come and order my Baby Back Ribs, Brisket (moist), Prime Rib, Sausage... Well Basically Everything.

Every order is at least 1/2 Lb.  Make sure you have a big appetite.
Love it when is just meat, no sauce (you add it yourself).  Other BBQ places I get sick of eating them because either too much sauce or too salty.  This is perfect!.

If you want sauce, they have the Rudy's Sissy Sauce and the regular Rudy's BBQ Sauce.

Side orders of Cole Slaw, Potato Salad are my FAVES!.....

We were taken care of by 4 different people, our server who took the order and brought drinks (started out can I get you something to drink?, which sort of makes me crazy, offer me something specific or tell me your favorite), another that brought our food and I love this, this means they care about getting food out while still hot, so thank you! In the end we were brought our check by another server and when I handed back the bill to him it took a little while to finally get it back...from yet another server. I understand team work but usually it comes along with a little communication. Where did our first server go? No mention if he went on break or dropped into an abyss. 
I have never seen a manager in this restaurant, at least that I can remember. I happen to like when the manager stops by and says hi and asks how the staff is doing on our visit. 
I am sure I will be back because the ladies of the house are fans and I wont have to go kicking and screaming because food is usually good, I just will not expect to be "wow"ed by the staff."}

My $14 "steak" chimi was filled with roughly 10 pieces of cubed beef (extra well done), TONS of cheese, and some sort of green pepper. Served with BLAND mashed potatoes and "nacho cheese sauce" (think gas station/ball park nacho "cheese") 

We didn't dine in, so I can't comment on service. 
Based off of the food quality - we won't be back."}

If you're brand new to Rudy's, let them know and they'll have someone come and explain the whole menu and how it works. They'll also let you sample the different meats before you purchase!

The atmosphere: It's very casual and friendly. They have huge metal containers with ice holding beers, sodas, and other fun drinks. (FYI, if you don't want the glass bottled sodas they do have regular cups and a self serve soda fountain.) Large picnic tables are placed in rows in the main dinning area as well as on their patios. Fun, vintage metal signs adorn the walls giving it a more country laid back kind of look. They also have flat screen TVs hanging around the dinning area to watch whatever game is on.

The Service: The first time we went everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The second time we were also greeted with smiles. The guy who took our order seemed a little grumpy but towards the end of our order he gave a big smile. I think he was just focusing on the order to make sure it was correct. Either way he didn't ruin our experience.

The Food: Both times the food has been delicious. The meat is tender and seasoned very well. I will say on our first visit my corn on the cob was over cooked but this last time I got the cream of corn and it was delicious!! And it is NOT like cream of corn from a can, do try there's, it's wonderful. The spicy chop and sausage is very tasty. My hubby loves the brisket! Next time I'm going to try their chicken. The new potatoes are great but if you get the butter on them they do put ALOT of butter, so maybe ask for them to go light on the butter. My hubby likes their potato salad, which is in the fridge near the front of the line, and he enjoys the corn as well. They only have two BBQ sauces to choose from, which are on all the tables, but both are tasty. One is  a little sweeter then the other and is always my choice. Know that when eating in the restaurant your meats will be placed on wax paper. At first I thought it was odd but after sitting down it just adds to their atmosphere and their meat is so tender that using the plastic forks and knives hasn't been an issue. As far as dessert I believe they have puddings and pies in the fridge but we've never had their desserts.

The ONLY bad thing I can honestly think of is the bread. They'll ask you if you want some bread to go with your meal for free but don't expect homemade rolls. It's actually sliced bread from a bag, just like what you buy at the grocery store. This is my reason for the 4 stars. They really should be baking their own rolls. The first time we did accept the bread not knowing but this last time we didn't bother with it.

Overall it's a great place for some yummy BBQ with a laid back atmosphere and the prices are well worth it."}

I tried it. 
It rocked!
He then provided the best service I've had there- and on par with the best ANYWHERE!

Look at the menu for sides, and try something new. I got the cilantro lime rice and it was moist and yummy.

Been here multiple times just to make sure it was consistent. And it's not! First time I came I got the moist brisket. yummy, barky, moist. Melts in your mouth delicious. Second time I came, it was nothing but fat and hints of yummy flavored meat. Third time was not the charm as I got nasty dry, flavorless brisket. As I continue to crave BBQ I do stop in here from time to time. Definitely hit or miss. Sometime this brisket is awesome, but 7 times out of 10 it's just ok. I honestly really don't like the BBQ sauce either.I don't know why but it's getting worse and worse
And the value is lacking cause BBQ is is usually pricey when it's top notch. It's a bbq chain, I'll stay away and go other bbq places like Texas smoke house bbq and little miss bbq. Porkopolis Is great too."}

Really, unless it's completely disgusting, it's all the same to me.  Tortillas, rice, beans, cheese.  By food alone none of my Mexican reviews would vary more than 1/2 a star up or down.  Again, when I go to Mexico, now that's a different, very yummy story.
So I'm going to judge the restaurant.  It's actually cute.  It has a large, covered, internal patio.  Which unfortunately is always full, I gotta aks if they take reservations.  But the ambience is nice, and the staff is friendly.  I disagree with other posters that it's expensive...it's average, and really, you get huge portions.  Ok, so they have large portions at Filiberto's too, but here you pay for the service and the ambiance.  So I didn't think it was that pricey.  I also like that it can accommodate large parties...restaurants like these are always hard to find.  Where do you take the grandparents, greatgrandparents, grandchildren, parents....?  here.  I don't think it's the place for hip people to hang out, or maybe not great for a romantic date, but it is perfect to bring your grandparents on your birthday, or your dad on father's day.  Every place has its purpose."}

If you're a first timer they will give you samples.  We tried the brisket, the chopped brisket, pulled pork, turkey and hot sausage.   Yum.  

We ended up ordering lean brisket, turkey, pulled pork and a hot link.  The brisket was good when hot, but got pot roasty as it cooled down.  The chopped brisket - which we didn't order was pretty good and we might get that next time.   Hubby liked the hot link - for me the skin was too poppy.  Pulled pork was a little greasy - but tasty.  The big surprise was the turkey - excellent.

Side dishes were just so so - the cole slaw was ok - but the beans were blah.  

It was a little noisy and not the most comfortable place - long tables - metal folding chairs - friendly atmosphere.

It's a place I look forward to anytime.  When I saw they were building a location, I was incredibly excited.  

The place is clean (as expected on the first day of business).  I was greeted right away upon showing up.  They had a line at 11am, and I showed up around 2:30, the first time the line didn't extend outside.  They did a great job of making sure the tables were kept clean, etc.  Something that often seems overlooked when a place is packed/busy.

Being their first day open, I was expecting some delays and mistakes, but I think everything went smoothly considering many of the customers were new to the process as well as the employees.  I got what I ordered, quickly and efficiently.  I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket (.53 lb to be exact), some "new potatoes" (red potatoes) and corn on the cob.  Had them throw some bread slices in.  They give you a great bottle crate to carry all the food.  It's better than a tray.  They can really pack it in there.  I got a large drink, as I plan to keep the cup and just bring it back for the $.75 refills.  They had fresh iced tea and everything was clean and organized.  I found a table and started eating.  I had just eaten at the Albuquerque location last weekend, but this was amazing.  Tasted as good as usual and I was impressed.  

I live in Central Phoenix and head out to the east valley once or twice a week.  I usually always head to Joe's in Gilbert, and will continue to do so occasionally even though I don't think it's as good (Rudy's brisket is better and they have corn on the cob and red potatoes - two things I wish Joe's had) or as consistent.  Given the choice, I'll pick Rudy's, though.  Our other local places don't hold a candle to Rudy's.

They all seem to run about the same price.  I was out of there for $13.98, which is about $1 more than Joes, but you get more food - just enough in fact.

It's a bit of a drive for me, but it's worth it.  I'll just have to make more excuses to be in the area.  I was very surprised to see that someone is opening a BBQ place directly across the street.  I admire the entrepreneurial spirit in this economy, but I'm afraid that they won't stand a chance with a Rudy's around."}

I had a beergarita to start, YUM! Nice and big. They also serve chips and salsa to start so that was cool too.

I had the chicken and enchilada plate with rice and the cheesey potatoes. This food is pretty Americanized which is fine by me since I am not a huge fan of this fare normally. The enchilada was so so in my mind but the taco was really good. I had the ground beef taco. The rice was typical rice but good and the cheesey potatoes were amazing (how cnayou go wrong with cheese and potatoes creamed to a nice puree?!)

Boyfriend got a HUGE platter of tacos and enchiladas and rice and beans and potatoes. I MEAN HUGE! It all tasted good and he's a huge critic since this is his favorite kind of food. He admitted his was Americanized as well but you can't complain if something tastes good right?

His mom was with us and she got the tilapia dish. It looked really healthy and smelled really good. Fresh veggie mix as the side with some rice and shrimp on top of the fish.

Overall I think this place was good. We had a gift card here so that was our excuse for going there. I don't know if we would ever go again since we don't live in the area but I am not ruling it out."}

Well we finally have our own Rudy's.  I showed up on opening day and am happy to report that the brisket is as delicious as I remember it.  Great smoke flavor.  Jalapeno sausage and turkey are favorites too.  Lastly, the creamed corn is excellent - never had any this good anywhere.     

This will be the only place I go for BBQ in the valley - glad it is close.

Consider calling ahead and placing your order.  It is very busy."}

My family and I weent early for Mother's Day dinner and I saw a shift in service and food quality.  On the plus side, the the Dip Sampler appetizer was one of the best I had.  But the service was very slow even when our waitress went down to 3 tables.  My wife's drink, ordered when we sat down, took 20 minutes to arrive.  She had a special request for the drink and it was ignored.  I had the Beef & Cheese Chimichanga.  It was VERY BAD.  The ground beef was either old or spoiled and it tasted sour.  I took two bites and stopped.  The waitress looked at me and said, "You don't like it?  Still deciding, huh?"  and then walked away.  She came back 15 minutes later and I kindly requested that it be taken off the bill.  She said a manager would come by the table, but he or she never did.  The charge was taken off the bill.  My wife's entree - the Juarez - and my daughter's Child's Beef Taco were fine.  My son's Fajita Tacos looked liked they were literally thrown together with no attempt at presentation.  When my family was finished eating their entrees, the waitress said she would bring the check and didn't ask us if we would like dessert or anything else.  Some may chalk off  my bad experience to it being Mother's Day, but if  restaurant can't give good service and great food when busy, why would you want to go there in the first place?"}

The brisket being a particular favorite, closely followed by the pulled pork, and they apparently serve breakfast now, so I'll have to stop in for brisket breakfast tacos sometime soon.  
   At any rate, Rudy's is one of the better BBQ chains out there, and frankly they're better than many mom and pop shacks I've been to over the years. My only drawback to coming here, is that my eyes are usually bigger than my stomach, but that just means I have leftovers! Every cloud etcetera."}

We live in Mesa so it was a bit of a drive for us but that's nothing new.
We dined with our 2 children on a week night.
Overall we felt like the food was comparable to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert & Dickey's BBQ in Mesa. Therefore, for us, we would prefer those other restaurants because they are closer. Also, we love the corn & chocolate chip cookies at Joe's and we love the mac & cheese and free ice cream at Dickey's. 
We did enjoy the red cream soda at Rudy's & their take home cups. Ironically, the cups at Dickey's are also take home & Joe's serves red cream soda too. 
For those who live in the area I'm sure it is a great place for them.
My husband recommends the brisket. The kids & I always get pulled pork sandwiches & they were good."}

Even if it isn't an enchilada, it's a sloppy liquidy mess of food.  It's an enchilada place!  That's ok.

My parents are in love with Abeulos because they're from Connecticut and when they think Mexican food, they think enchiladas as it's all they know.

The place is pricey for what you get.  $15-20 for a couple mediocre, small enchiladas.  I won't ever be going here on my own.  When I go with them I order the cheapest thing on the menu.
  
Of note is something strange.  Abuelos has three salsas that come with chips when you sit down.  One is ok, and the other two are terrible.  They are very, very bad.  Here in Arizona, I can find the best salsas I have ever had.  But not at Abuelos.  Just everywhere else.  One is green and very sweet.  It must have a lot of sugar in it because no fruit is that sweet.  Weird."}

I still wish that they would use plates (even paper plates would do) instead of doing the whole butcher paper thing just because they are trying to be cute. Regardless, they have some pretty tasty barbeque and a decent beer selection. They are so close to our house my husband and I stop by every once in a while and have not been disappointed with the food (even though I do still prefer Andrew's). My favorite is the lean brisket with their spicy bbq sauce. I really wish they had cornbread but their baby potatoes make a pretty good side dish.

Last summer my hubby's nephew held his graduation dinner here. I was wishing that he would have chosen someplace a little nicer but it actually worked out great because everyone could order what they wanted without fights over the check at the end of the night. The manager reserved the private room for us even though we were only a group of about 25 so we could have easily sat in the main restaurant. But it was nice to have the privacy. They even let us bring in an ice cream cake and kept it in the freezer for us until after the meal. Everyone who works here is pretty friendly but the service that night was above and beyond so I had to give them 4 stars for that."}

Their chips and salsa were fantastic.  Their green salsa is out of this world.  It's a really good thing I really liked the chips and salsa and was able to chow down, because dinner...

The Bad - Two things
One - I ran into something at Abuelo's that I've run into at a Chili's and I've learned a couple other chains are starting to do...Applebee's is the one I recall a friend mentioning.  There was a digital screen on our table!  At my Chili's experience, I learned that one thing they do with these screens is make available the specialty menus - vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan, kosher, etc.  Ok, fine.  I didn't ask Emily to pull up a veggie menu on the screen because, frankly, I wanted nothing to do with it!  The first thing we did was put our screen face down on the table.  It was impossible not to see the screens on other tables as they flashed through quizzes, games, information about the restaurant's history, etc.  I can only guess that Abuelo's is trying to get families to all interact with the screen so people all don't all pull out their cell phones while waiting for their food to come out...I HOPE that's their goal, anyway.  The presence of these things just depressed and sickened me.  Do Americans really need this sort of stimulation?  What has happened to the art of dinner conversation and coming together to talk about our days?  Abuelo's, why are you adding in more digitainment to distract those of us actively trying to - for example - teach our children that dinner-time is a time to put AWAY the electronics in order to enjoy one another's company?  Ugh!  Yuck!  Why?


Two - As a vegetarian, I'm used to ending up with black beans and some other rice substituted for the usual rice.  I'm not used to the beans being so salty they can't be eaten.  I also think they would have been better trying for maybe a little salad instead of their "specialty cilantro rice".  It was literally white rice cooked with cilantro and I think that was IT.  No seasonings to speak of.  Bland, bland, bland!  I got the avocado and the spinach enchiladas per the server's suggestion.  They were in some sort of crepe wrapping and tasty enough, but honestly...for the price it seemed like they should have doubled the number of enchiladas.  It really wasn't much food once you factor in the rice and beans I couldn't get myself to eat.  (I brought them home to have someone else taste test just to make sure I wasn't being too picky...sorry Abuelo's...it wasn't me!)

Abuelo's was a HUGE disappointment.  Thankfully, I had great company?  Truly, I can see the potential of this place.  It could have fantastic.  They claim to be old-fashioned Mexican food and the presence of lard in the refried beans and the use of chicken stock in the rice backs that claim up!  They've got a HUGE menu.  I think that if a bit more thought were put into vegetarian options and those darn screens went away, my review of this place would improve dramatically.  The whole feel of the place would be different!


Last note about those screens - apparently they can be used to pay for one's bill.  As someone who's lived in Silicon Valley and hung out with many, many, a computer expert...when it comes time to pay your bill, please RUN from these wireless terminals.  Keep your credit card info safe.  Have the restaurant run your card the old-fashioned way!"}

I'd choose Abuelo's before all the other places. Why? Simply because for a chain establishment, the food offered is quite good, and the prices comparable. 

I tend to go for the seafood choices of Abuelo's I've had the Pescado Guerrero and the Enchiladas de Cozumel. Both entrees are good, the Pescado Guerrero is a mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp,
scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced
avocado in a delicious white wine sauce. It's delicious, the mahi-mahi isn't fishy at all, and the accompaniment of the roasted peppers with the sliced avocado balances the dish. As for the Enchiladas de Cozumel, it is crepes filled with fresh guacamole, covered
in a rich white wine sauce with a medley of perfectly seasoned
shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, fresh spinach and roasted peppers, the dish is similar to the Pescado Guerrero hence why I like both. 

Another plus for Abuelo's are its tortilla chips and salsa. The tortilla are so crisp that they're quite addictive, and the salsa is not overtly spicy, and has a thick consistency. Something that I do enjoy. So, if you have a hankering for some Mexican, I suggest you try Abuelo's if there's a location near you, it's worth it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"}

Right off the bat let me state that I come here to eat meat - period. I couldn't really care less about the sides, although their chocolate pudding is top notch. Rudy's brisket is the best I've ever eaten. Let that sink in ... the best I've ever eaten. Their smoked turkey is life-changing, it's so good. I usually order two meat selections and one of them is usually a hot link. So it's lean brisket and a hot link or pulled pork and a hot link, you get the idea. They have two types of BBQ "sause", spicy and the kind my wife likes (sissy sause). Both are good, although I'm partial to the spicy stuff. The dining area is clean, family-style seating at long tables with folding chairs or patio tables on the semi-enclosed "patio". There's lots of TVs showing sporting events and C&W music on the speakers (I can't stand C&W, but I'll tolerate it to eat this food). Back to the food - my wife likes their green chili stew and their peach cobbler. The stew is good, but I'm not a cobbler kind of guy. Their breakfast tacos are also really good and inexpensive. We have been eating here for years, and I eat lunch here 2-3 times a month as I work nearby. We have never had a bad experience at Rudy's.

If you live anywhere near I-10, you've probably seen that eyesore of a red barn that is Rudy's BBQ.  It's a dining experience unlike any other in the Valley.  It's like a delicatessen, crossed with a picnic, and covered in BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is really good, but I learned a few things that will make my experience even better next time.

Tip #1:  Show up early for lunch.  It's not as packed as when it first opened, but we waited about 10 minutes to order at 11:45.  Wait until 12:15 and you'll have a long line and trouble finding seats.

Tip #2:  Understand what you're getting.  You can order sandwiches, but most people order meat by the pound.  The sign says $6.49 for a half pound of brisket, but you pay what it weighs.  My portion was over $7.  I wouldn't recommend the "cutter's choice" option.  I saved some pocket change, but my brisket didn't look as moist or as lean as my friends'.

Tip #3:  Order pint sides and share them among your friends.  It's better value.

They serve the food in what looks to be a wax paper lined milk carton.  After navigating the condiment bar (try the cherry peppers), you can look for a small wooden picnic table, or take up part of a large table covered with red and white table cloths.

As for the food itself, the brisket had a great smokey flavor, but it was dry in places, and had large hunks of fat.  I blame myself for ordering "cutter's choice."  Rookie mistake.  The cole slaw was really good.  The cabbage was minced pretty fine, and it was sweet and creamy, but not too creamy.  The new potatoes were just roasted potatoes in butter.  They definitely needed salt, and the inch of melted butter in the bottom of the styrofoarm bowl was an unappetizing visual.  There were two bbq sauces on the table.  I liked the tangy, vinegary flavor.  One was supposed to be spicier than the other, but they tasted similar to me.  Both had kick.

I have some friends in Austin, TX that think Rudy's rivals Salt Lick BBQ, and I think they're crazy.  It's good, but it's not that good.  The smokey flavor of the brisket definitely stood out, though.  I'm looking forward to my next visit, when I can navigate the menu a little easier."}

Ordered a brisket sandwich. The beef was so dry it was inedible. I had no time to return it. I am not the BBQ eater where I use a lot of sauce as it then covers up the fakir of the meat. Doing so would be Ike why even bother taking the time to slow smoke the meat in the first place. I actually choked on this it was like leather. It alone was way over salted for my taste. 

Even if I was able to return this meat it should never made it to my plate like that. That plate is a signature dish and should never be prepared and served like this in my opinion. 

Great atmospheric and comfortable environment. Wish there was a manager on duty that asked me how the food was. Just a bunch of kids last Saturday at 5PM. 

If I could I would have given this 0 stars as my sandwich and coleslaw and water was over $10 and was near inedible. 

Lots of BBQ choices one right next door! 

You guys need to get your quality control in order and make sure your manager is more proactive with the customers!!!!!"}

Rudy's prices are outrageous, if this place actually smoked their own meat and had a guy tending a smoker all night long I would go back.

We got brisket, jalapeño sausage, pulled pork, ribs, cole slaw, corn on the cob, potatoes, and some bread.  A bucket of beer and we were set to go!  Everything was delicious, and it was a fun place to eat with communal picnic tables and self service everything.  Their sauces had great spice, or you could get sissy sauce if you wanted less heat.  I wish they had wet wipes though, it would have made the experience much less messy considering the amount of ribs we had."}

The smoked turkey has an incredible spice rub and is super tender.

As for sides - get the creamed corn.  I never liked creamed corn until i had theirs.  
The green chili stew is very, very flavorful

My wife normally gets the pulled pork and enjoys it.  The kids like their smoked links.  

Only things we would stay away from going forward is the beans and their ribs.  both are ok but way better choices on the menu.

OH and the service, incredible.  Take someone with you and they immediate start offering samples."}

Fresh cut white meat turkey on a bun--rye bread would be better but to keep the cost down, they only offer something close to a hamburger bun. .l also had the small potato salad and a diet coke. 

For those who are dining here the first time--the ordering line is long during peak hours. No plates and every item ordered arrives in a tray. Once you get your tray, turn right to the soda machine and condiments. Everything needed can be found here.

The menu is simply placed on the wall with quite a few options, but not too many to make your decision impossible. You're able to try a sample before you order it if you would like as well. 

The pulled-pork sandwich I ordered was cooked to perfection and paired with some really buttery and delicious mashed potatoes ( btw, I am a mashed potato fiend). 

The staff is friendly and upbeat and their service is quite speedy. 

Rudy's would be  a five star for me if it weren't for the picnic benches. I am all for theming your restaurant, however picnic benches are, and always will be, my idea of a bad time. They aren't comfortable and it's also weird because they're connected, like in a cafeteria. If I wanted to sit next to random people, I would go to a sushi bar or something of the sort. I just wanted to sit with my friends and enjoy my meal without the person next to me honing in on my conversations. 

All together, though, I do think I will return to Rudy's for some fine pulled-pork."}

They also had bar with other sides including pickles, tomato peppers, jalapeños, etc. Two tasty sauces are on the tables. One a little more spicy and one more vinegary. Both tasty. I prefer the Sissy sauce (more vinegary). 

Everything was tasty. Including the sides. Potato salad was great. I'm addicted to the cherry peppers. We will definitely be back. Great place to take big groups and friends."}

The location is kind of in an awkward spot. It's on the north side of Chandler Rd just east of the i10. Rudys is frustrating. I enjoy cooking BBQ and mine isn't nearly as good. I love that they let you try all the different meats. I generally go with 1/2lb Prime Rib or 1/2 moist brisket. Both are awesome. You pay by the pound so the majority of the time they overshoot the weight, which is fine. Rudys offers two different sauces, I prefer their normal sauce to the sassy sauce. So here's my only knock on Rudys, their sides are kind of weak. I've tried a majority of them and I just don't think any are up to the standard in which they make the BBQ. The BBQ and service are 5 stars all day long. Sides and price of drinks are maybe 2 stars?"}

Neat set up with the way you get your food. It's all a la carte style. The decor is homey and open....quite comfortable. 
Once in line, you can choose from a variety of bottled drinks or can order a fountain drink at the end. Then you can choose a cold side and/or dessert such as cole slaw or pudding. Then on to the main attraction...a large cutting station behind the registers where you order sits several cuts of meat to choose from. And the best part is you can try any (or all) of them before buying. This really made the difference. 
I tried the pulled pork, the lean brisket and the moist brisket. I ended up with the moist brisket sandwich. It was amazingly tender. I also choose the chocolate pudding (YUMMY) and corn on the cob. All the food was delicious. 

Pro: You can set your own meal. Price is by the half pound so if you want a bit more, that is a plus. Also, you don't have to have a set meal. It's what you make of it.

Con: First time here, and I felt a bit rushed while in line. This made it a bit stressful. Also, I would suggest to add salt to your dish as it was a bit lacking in the meal. 

Overall: I would go again, just because I can get something different every time and I can taste before I buy."}

After Saturday I will do neither because Rudy's broke the rule. Note to Rudy, COLD BBQ at any price is not very good. 
We ordered the moist brisket, good thing as I would have hated to see the not moist version. Really good brisket but cold and not really moist.
Brisket baked potato, good lord how do you serve a baked potato cold where the butter just sits there and the cheese never has a prayer to melt.  It was terrible to try and mash the cold butter, cold sour crème and cold cheese together when the potato is hard and, yes, cold.
BBQ Chicken, amazing but this was the worst part of the meal. BBQ chicken from a "BBQ" place should have a dark char to the skin with some kind of heat or flavor to say BBQ. This thing was 4 pieces of yellow fowl, literally cold to the touch with flavorless skin. 
Yes I could have taken it up and asked them to serve me a hot, maybe warm meal that I just paid a lot of money for. We just picked on a potion of it and threw the rest away. 
So back to the rule. I will not be back and I did tell a friend but it was not what Rudy's was hoping for.          
Note to self, when you walk into a BBQ joint at 12:00 on a Saturday and there's no line, go next door."}

I've been to other ones in texas where they don't mind talking to you. Yes I ordered a lot of food bc we had a huge appetite but I didnt appreciate her derogatory tone when she said "is that enough food for you now?" and no, she wasnt being sarcastic.

1. Had to move booths because the first booth and seats were so spread apart we had to literally sit at the edge of  our seats to reach the table.
2. Decor/ style was over indulgent for a Mexican restaurant and reminded me of a cheap version of the Venetian hotel in Vegas. Very tacky.
3. If you are looking for a cool, hip restaurant this isn't it. 
4. Margarita was good but gone after just a few drinks.  For $10 I expected a bit more grande than what I got.
5. Jalapeño fritters were the best thing I ate. They we're served warm. Asked server if I could get hot ones and he replied somewhat annoyed and confused " do you want me to throw them back in the fryer?"  Enough said there. (The manager did return with hot ones and did not charge us for the item.)
6. Yes, they have 3 types of salsa....and that's about it.  The green one is just plain offensive. Not sure how that one found its way into a so called authentic Mexican restaurant. It was also very challenging to scoop out salsa from the small tin bowls when they come about a 1/4 full.
7. Ordered fajitas. Let's see...flavorless and waaaay overlooked. Just plain bad! 
Not sure what people like so much about this food. I'd rather go to Chipotle."}

The green chili soup was spicy and would have been better if it was mac n cheese lol (which they don't have) The jalapeno link was good and spicy, but the bbq sauces were alright, the original reminds me of Open Pit BBQ sauce (I like it) and they have a spicy one too.

Service- Cafeteria line, multiple people taking orders, friendly and polite, but felt like a McDonald's of bbq.

I came here with a friend recently for dinner. They have a huge menu, and, not being familiar with their food, decided to play it safe with a chicken burro (also, it was less expensive). What I was brought at first looked akin to a huge, flat fish on a platter -took me a bit to realize it was a burrito. It was literally just a flat, super (or should I say souper) saucy burrito with a splash of lettuce on the side. It seriously lacked flavor, and wasn't worth the price. I'm sure some of the fancier things may be good, but I wouldn't eat here again unless I had to."}

First time visitors and we read the comments posted on Yelp so had a bit of an expectation going in.  You stand in line, check out the menu, grap bottled drinks, get your salad sides and desserts out of the cooler and then up to register to order.  We were offered a tasting of lean brisket and turkey...which were great.  My partner had decided on the brisket in line and quickly changed to the turkey.  It was fabulous!  I had the baby back ribs.  They were meaty and yummy.  Yes...no sauce, which is exactly how we like them because then you control the amount of sauce you want on them!  We also had the cole slaw (it needs more dressing, guys...a bit dry), the 3 bean salad (a bit sweeter but we both really liked it) and we had to try the smoked baked potatoe (butter, sour cream, and cheese)...dang it was big (like a small football) and yummy.  You can definitely taste the smoke on the skin.  

You sit at community tables, which was fine by us!  We love to meet and chat with new people...we sat out on the porch, which was great! 

The condiment bar was clean and nicely stocked.  Previous reviewers mention that you eat on paper, use plastic, etc....we think that's what brings the uniqueness to Rudy's.  We had no issue!

We both had ice tea; my partner loved the sweet tea!  I had regular, which was good.  There are two bbq sauces to use...I'm a whimp so I found the whimpy sauce good, a bit peppery, but I liked it.  Certainly not the best I've ever had but then everyone has their favorite sauce!  My partner tried the hotter one and ended up using the whimpy one as well.

We had the banana pudding for dessert...my partner loved it and I thought it was ok...not a big fan of soggy nilla wafers!

Today I had pulled pork and "Rudy's Beans".  I always get the pulled pork on a first visit to any BBQ place.  It's how I measure the place.

The beans are really mediocre.  Very soupy, a lot of pepper, and really nothing special.  Not bad, but not great.

The pork has a very mustard-y flavor.  Caught me by surprise.  I had thought mustard-y BBQ was typical of Tennessee and the Appalachian region.  But it was good.  And it was BIG.  They put a lot of meat on that sandwich!  There was also some chopped-up vegetables in it (onion and celery, I think).

I tried my wife's brisket and creamed corn.  The brisket was very smoky, and very nice.  I hate creamed corn, but this one was actually pretty good.  I was surprised.

They were also giving out samples of their sausage.  That was really really good!!  I ordered some for take-out.

Not as good as Joe's Real BBQ, but better than Dave's!  Also, I noticed that their sauce is labeled with "contains no HFCS".  Which is great!!  You can buy their sauce and rub in their store.

The place is loud.  You go up to the counter, tell them what you want, and they shout to the cooking folks in the back.  They also shout "next in line" a lot.  The meats are sold in 1/2 lb increments.

I'm sure we'll be back."}

I died and went to heaven where all the good pigs and all the good cows go. God then decided let's have a good BBQ with all these good animals... ahaha!  But really, that is how the story goes of how this place got started, haha! J/K! But could be ;)

I fell in love with this place, very casual, hands on and yummylicious! As i walked in it was love at first smell, I have already decided that I'll be taking my next road trip to AZ just to come and eat at Rudy's... just have to wait for a nice long weekend to come by.

This place is great, they make you feel welcomed and at ease as soon as you come in. By the looks of it, if you've never been there you would get a bit nervous at the way you have to order and just from having to figure it out. But no problem, someone greeted us at the door and explained the entire process and then it was all nice and easy. It sort of felt like I was standing in the lunch line at my old elementary cafeteria, except here you have the option of picking up a metal bucket and filling it with a variety of beers (that would of bee something in school! haha!) or bottled drinks but you can also go with regular fountain drinks if you prefer. 

In the seating area there are these long picnic-like tables and TV's around. You use tear out paper instead of plates and you don't need utensils but they have them if you must. 

Now lets get down to business; The meat is great, delicious tasting without even any BBQ sauce added. You get to sample as many different types as you like (except with bone) before you buy and they sell it by the pound (lb.) or in sandwiches. Let me tell yall, we tried it all! And it was all great, so good that we couldn't decide on what to get. The turkey was so moist and juicy. The sausage was yummy and spicy. The pulled pork, the beef, the ribs, the brisket...aaah I can go on. It was all yummy! Then you get to add the sauce and its something else from there; spicy, sweet, regular.

I can't go on because I'm going to start drooling just from thinking about it.
I will end with this, its a must try if your ever in AZ. Road trip anyone!?
Fingerlicking yummyliciousness! Enjoy!

P.S. Oh yeah, they also have a variety of sides (cole slaw, potato salad, corn etc.) and chicken ( and if you must know I don't care for any chicken, but I'm sure thats good too)."}

We tried the pudding they had for dessert banana and chocolate the banana was great !! I thought the music was great  overall I think they need to be aware of the fat and take it off the meat before they send it out !!

The quintessential Tex-Mex plate is cheese enchiladas with chili gravy, crunchy beef tacos, and tamale with rice and beans.  They hit the mark right-on with the enchilada and taco, but the tamale is so-so.  Chips are outstanding and the salsa is very good.  The place is a little too fancy and the prices are a bit high, but you won't walk away hungry."}

None the less I really needed some good BBQ! Googled places near me and a good number came up, but Rudy's had a ton or reviews and high ratings. So, I'm off to Rudy's! It was well worth the drive in the AZ heat! The place is well set up and organized. A good menu with plenty of options. And the staff was very pleasant and helpful! I overheard the gentleman behind the counter helping the couple next to me and he was very courteous, explained how they do things and even offered them samples of a few things. The lady that helped me was super nice too! Anyways, I got a sausage, baby back ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, potato salad and coleslaw. Maybe a little overboard, but it all sounded good and I'm babysitting my dad while mom is out of town Everything was awesome and the portions were huge! The pulled pork sandwich was what I really went there for and it was awesome! Great smoked flavor and their sauce that you get on the side is super good as well!

Food - So I had two enchiladas...chicken with a queso sauce and a spinach and mushroom with a cream sauce. Both were deliciously spicy (because their sauces were on point!). For my sides, I chose the spinach casserole and their mashed potatoes. The sides were a delicious change of pace to the rice and beans that I usually get. My counterpart enjoyed the fajitas and the cervezarita, and the only thing he would have changed would have been more peppers with the fajitas (as it was mostly onion). 

Service - The service we received was prompt and attentive.

Food is much fresher at lunch and I've been served some freshly cut, steaming hot Brisket and Baby back ribs to die for. The fall off the bone goodness basically didn't even need any sauce it was that good. 

However, I've also come during dinner where quality fluctuates greatly. I've been served decent BBQ at best and dry BBQ at the worst. Even the baby back ribs at night have been much tougher/drier and turkey has lacked moisture almost to the point of feeling like eating hydrated jerky or something.

Overall, it's a great lunch joint, when food turnover is high and they're cranking out fresh food constantly. Dinner, I'd personally avoid. 

I've had most of their menu so far and I can recommend the following especially during lunch:
Brisket Lean
Turkey
Hot Links (Jalapeno, if you can handle actual spicy. If Tabasco is too much for you, don't bother trying)
Baby Back Ribs
Green Chile Stew

Haven't tried their prime rib yet among some other stuff, but I've almost had everything else. I'm not a big fan of their refrigerated stuff like coleslaw as they have a bunch of styrofoam cups prefilled with food and based on what I've tried it isn't very fresh to me.

Sauces wise they have their standard and a Sissy sauce. Both taste really similar to me and neither of them are very spicy, just more of the standard sweet BBQ sauce."}

So we get to the restaurant and the ambiance and décor remind me of a dim Cheesecake Factory - restaurant was open, nice, and chain-like. We get seated and we order the sangria. Sangria was good and strong - my kind of drink!  Then we get the complimentary chips and salsa - eh, ok.

My bf and I order the Monterrey.  It was a big plate enough for two people: Sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole. 

We started chowing down and every bite I took tasted like the last - no matter which part of the plate I was eating. The food was bland and lacked flavor.  I was so disappointed!  Luckily, my sangria was kicking in, so my disappointment did not ruin my happy mood.

I have been to 5 Rudy's and always loved them but the brisket here still needs a lot of work,  A+ on the pulled pork, the pork loin was a little dry and did not have the taste of right out of the smoker, the cream corn was nocked out of the park as usual. 

I really expected some type of grand opening specials too, but at least I no longer have to drive to Abq to eat at Rudy's!!!

I have eaten at Abuelo's a handful of times over the years and the only meal that really stands out in my memory is the shrimp Veracruzano. I think their version of that dish is pretty good. Most of their plates fit the Phoenix Mexican restaurant MO: rice and refried beans with an entree that is fried and/or covered in cheese and chilli sauce.

The decor at Abuelo's for some reason reminds me of a Vegas casino. A little over the top. Kind of cheesey but still fun and nice it its own way. Service has always been good. If I remember right they have a decent bar, too.

This is not on my regular rotation but I am willing to go here if someone else invites me.  For more authentic Mexican you can try Espo's down the street but you will not get the same level of service or ambiance."}

Don't get out much to the southern boonies and thru word of mouth found this BBQ Texas gem.  We had a group that mostly live that way so with a visit to the nearby outlet for a new pair of running shoes, we made a full day out of it. Meat meat and meat also worked out to be an awesome gluten free suggestion for our friends with sensitivities. 

The menu was super easy to navigate cuz we didn't have to! As soon as we entered the order line a staff member came up and asked us if it was our virgin visit and proceeded to explain the options available in their BBQ universe, and also said the counter staff would accommodate some taste testing prior to ordering. What an awesome example of customer service. Meat is purchased as in a meat market where the menu simply states the price in 1/2lb increments and you can order more or less and pay by whatever the weight machine measures up!

So we got some tastings of their regular leaner brisket, the pulled pork and prime rib, all were exceptional and we could've gone for any of the three, but I had my mind set in some type of ribs, and the staff suggested the regular pork ribs over the baby back for a more meatier serving. Hubby got the moist brisket as the lean was in fact too lean for his tastes. We passed on the bread which is offered in a half or full loaf, not sure if it's made in house but glancing at the volume, the plastic store packaging gave it away. Our choice was to go Texas big or go home, so we ordered the baked potato with the works that was bathed in super heaves of sour cream and cheese...yes hibernation will soon follow.

Everything was beyond Guy Fieri acceptable and we had a great meal, particularly you can ask for barkier (is that a word) brisket too! So for a good time at a casual joint, excellent BBQ, Rudy's is a change in our dietary routine and the epitome of a cheat night! The outdoor patio was also pet friendly as we brought Luke who scooped up any scraps before there even made it's way to the floor, Woof!"}

Fine...anything for a friend. Wow...I have to admit that the service has improved drastically. Maybe the manager does read the yelp review....?

Unlike our last visit, the hostress did sat us on a comfortable booth away from the kitchen without asking. Shortly after chips and salsa was served, the waiter showed up lightening fast and gave us the ice tea that we ordered right away. For appetizer, we ordered small shrimp ceviche for less than $5. Even thought the portion was small, it was a good size to fill me up before our parties arrived. It has a bit too much tomatoes in it which makes it tardy...overall, I still enjoyed it. For my main entree, I ordered fajitas for 1 with all beef (you can choose two different types of meat if you like chicken, shrimps or veggie) and double size of Spanish rice. The meat portion was very generous, but it was a little on the dry side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it after mixing it with salsa to make up for the dryness. 

We told the waiter that it was our friend's birthday. When we were done with our entrees, he gave us a plate of chips with scoops of ice-cream on each one of them. It was quite delicious. After we paid the bills, he still stopped by to give us refill for drinks and did not ignore us like the last waiter did. I'm extremely impressed with the improvement that they've made since my last visit."}

When I moved from NM it I was having BBQ fits as I could not find the smokey goodness I was accustomed to with the 2 Rudy's available to me in Albuquerque.   The quest seemed endless and futile for bbq through the Valley until I found Texas BBQ house (24th St and Rosear).  They are so close for me in many ways (distance and flavor) they help quell that gnawing in the pit of my being for quality Texas style BBQ.  But on one of my last visits they did not have the cobbler or the smoked baked potatoes (so close!).  

I split my time between the 2 joints.  If I find myself in the SE valley I stop at Rudy's.  If I need some smoked baked potatoes for my famous smoked baked potato salad I go to Rudy's.   Otherwise it is a toss up.  But I have been willing to make the trek just to get my Rudy's fix. 

Other Rudy's musts:
-I usually get  a bit of moist and a bit of cutter's choice which is often lean.  
-I find the regular smoked sausage to be better than the jalapeno one.  
-Their smoked turkey is the best ever.  The chicken is just ok relatively.  [Both make great chicken enchiladas.]
-Pork Ribs are better than the Baby Backs IMHO
- Try the baked potato loaded with meat at least once.  Great to share or have as 1 filling or 2 (maybe 3 meals relative to your appetite) 
- Favorite sides:  Creamed corn, green chile stew and 3 bean salad"}

The line during dinner time is ridiculously crazy but it moved at a pretty fast pace.  Long dining tables and plenty of seats made the fear of having to stand and eat non-existent.  I ordered 1/2lb of moist brisket with a potato salad side and banana pudding for dessert.  Yum!  That brisket was pure fatty goodness and I probably should've ordered it lean but hey.  No regrets!  Barbequed meat done right doesn't need sauce but I found myself making a tiny brisket sandwich with the bread and some BBQ sauce.  The potato salad was good but nothing to write home about.  I also got to steal some of my friend's three-bean salad which seemed like it would have helped cut through the fat better than my creamy potato salad.  I love chick peas!  The banana pudding made me want to dance though.  It was the perfect ending to such a rich meal.  I was a happy happy girl.

While I'm no BBQ expert, I enjoyed my dinner at Rudy's and I'd definitely stop by again!"}

And something is different.

Previously I gave them four stars.  They were very good.  Their rub was flavorful and their smoking was good.  This time I didn't taste the rub at all, nor the smoking.  Didn't see a smoke ring.  Nothing.  And this was on their brisket, which is one of my favorite things they do!!  What happened?

The creamed corn and green chili were both still very good (and I usually hate creamed corn).  But the meats were not nearly as flavorful as they used to be.  Maybe a one-time aberration, or maybe a fundamental change.  Don't know which.  But the lack of consistency has to cost them a star.  If it weren't for the chili and corn, it would be two stars because the meats were very ordinary.  Nothing special.

Whatever they changed they need to un-change or they'll end up in the pile of places I've been but won't go back to.  Which would be sad because I liked them before."}

But, have to say the Chandler location was even better than those in Houston. Not an avid fan, but was definitely better.

Line was ridiculous to get in, my guess, something knew = novelty. People were nice, outside area was quiet and spacious. 

Food = we sampled the brisket and we ordered the pulled pork. Definitely agree with the reviews, very peppery on the pork, but not fatty. Would get the brisket if we go back. My husband and our friends got the loaded baked potato with meat on top, they rated it better than Joe's BBQ, which says a lot. 

I just had the 1/2 lb pork in a tub. Why only 3 stars? Not a fan of the sauce, and without it, meat was just ok. Is more vingary and peppery than sweet. Would I get to go or go back again, probably, but bring my own 'sause'. And, had to add more sugar to the 'sweet tea'. Nix on the coleslaw - no taste.

Overall, good not stellar, but good. TX Roadhouse still has the best pulled pork around if you like it sweet."}

There are two ways to order, either go to the front register area and purchase a pre made taco, or go to the main ordering area and customize your taco.  If you are in a rush, definitely go with the pre-made tacos.  They taste fine and are warm.  If you have few minutes to kill, then order your custom taco and walk around, explore the "interesting" Texas/Nascar/gas station decor.  I ordered the brisket with potatoes, cheese, and eggs.  It comes with a flour tortilla.  I found that one did not fill me up so I ordered another.  The piece de resistance, the meat, was tender and moist, just as expected.  It did have a gas type of oder which I was not digging.   Now I need to go back and explore more of my normally suppressed carnivore urges and try the lunch and dinner offerings."}

My honey and I, in a moment of Mexican food desperation, stopped by Abuelo's because we've heard good things. 

People lie.

The chips were thin, which I normally like, but they were so thin they couldn't support the salsa. The salsa left much to be desired. While flavorful, the taste was surprising. And not in a good way. (Kind of like when you order a Coke™ in the drive-thru and end up with Dr. Pepper™ instead.)

The margaritas were deceivingly generous. I filled my glass three times, but the alcohol content was very low. Were it not for the calories, I could have had five or six of them and still cleared a breathalyzer.

As for the actual meal, I don't know where to begin. I have had better Mexican food frozen from a box than I was served at Abuelos. The sauce tasted heavy of preservatives and more like something you'd get from a can. The pork and the beef on both of our dishes was chewy, and too, more like something you'd get from a can. Honestly, the whole meal was just ick.

The only possible redeeming aspect of the meal could have been dessert, but, alas, they don't serve your traditional Mexican desserts. Fried ice cream is not to be found anywhere on the menu. Of course, fried ice cream doesn't come in a can, so.. there ya have it.

I would avoid this restaurant. If you're in the mood for Mexican and are in the area, see some of my other reviews."}

We warned them that the last time my Husband, Son and I had been there, the food and service was not quite what it used to be. Well, we should have listened to ourselves. The last time we thought they must have just had a bad night and so tonight was going to be better. Boy were we wrong. The Hostess seated us quickly and courteously, no worries, right? My Husband ordered the drinks for us ( 3 Ice Teas & a Coke), while I went to the Restroom to wash my hands. I always make it a habbit to look in the stalls even when I wash my hands. The Toilets had  paper in them and the seats were in need of cleaning. But okay. I thought about telling the manager, but did not want to cause any issues. 

When I returned to the table, the chips and salsa had been placed. (Chips are very thin and the Salsa is very runny). Trying to put Salsa on the Chip is not easy and you have to hold your hand under because it will drip on your shirt otherwise, trust me. 
There was no plates provided to keep one clean. 
After about 5 minutes Chip our server brought the Drinks and went off somewhere. About 10 minutes later he returned to take our order. When I asked about the Salsa he said that this is how it is brought in, so I assume they don't make it fresh on the premises. Big minus, because it is not that expensive to make yourself and there are a lot of good recipes out there. One of the Red Sauces tasted really weird, the other one was good, but like I said to runny. The Green one, kind of tasted like their was Pineapple Juice in it? Strange. 
We ordered the Guacamole Appetizer so that we could eat the Chips and the Guacamole was really good. 
The food arrived. We had ordered 2 Beef Fajitas, one for my Dad and one for my Mom. My Husband and I decided to split the Ribeye & Enchiladas. We opted for the Cheese Enchiladas. The Beef Fajita Meat was extremely chewey. My Parents could not eat it. We had ordered our Ribeye Medium and it was very well done, my Husband who used a Steak Knife had a hard time cutting thru it. Did I mention how really thin the Ribeye was? 
We were looking for our Waiter Chip who was nowhere to be found. About 10 minutes later we got the Busboy to get us the Manager. She came out and asked what the problem was and I told her about the meat. She said sorry, but it immediately followed with an explanation on how they cook the Fajita Meat and when I showed her our "medium" Ribeye she went on to tell me how they now have a new supplier. 
Now, having been in the Food Business myself for over 31 years, I do know that the supplier does not do the cooking and that really was not what I wanted to hear. She did ask if we wanted the food to be redone and my parents and us asked for the Meat to be remade. 
It took 20 minutes for the remade meat to come out. By that time, my Mom had finished the sides that came with her fajitas and we had eaten the underwhelming cheese enchiladas and the some of the drippy Beans (more landed on my shirt, it was this runny) and my Dad really didn't want to eat the sides because he was just so upset about all of this. 
Anyways, the Meat is brought out, the manager wanted to know if she should take my Dad's sides and I said, may as well, because they were cold now, to which she replied that she asked me if I wanted the sides redone as well. 
I admit, I did not ask her to that at the time, but what upset me was her tone of voice when she asked me. 
My parents went ahead and ate the Meat, because they were really hungry, even so it was still a bit on the chewy side. Not sure what kind of Meat they use, but it is a tough one. We had driven over 300 miles today and were starving. 
My husband could not finish the Ribeye, because it was still not that easy to cut thru the fat on the still very thin steak. I ate my half, because I was also just hungry.

At the end of the Meal, Chip and the Manager both tried to upsell us on Desert. Are you kidding me? After the mediocre Meal we just had? We really did not want to take any chances and have to pay for a bad desert as well. 
I would have appreciated a small discount, maybe the drinks off? But we ended up having to pay for the full meal, even so the quality and service was severely lacking tonight.

I wrote a comment on their website, don't know if they will care enough to respond. This just left us totally flabbergasted as how bad they have become. Used to be our favorite Mexican Restaurant, guess now we will have to go find a new one."}

Rudy's is the first one but I'm not planning in comparing against each other but to rate my experience.

The ambiance and decor is nice if you like the back patio setting style with big tables barn-like. I liked it but I could easily understand people being annoyed by this.

Service. A line-up service where you buy your food by the pound with the drinks in coolers is kind of interesting. It reminds me Fuddrucker's back in the late 80's.

Presentation. A huge tray without plates, all in paper (butcher paper) gives (again) that backyard family bbq appeal that can be disappointing for some people.

Price. The price is just OK, not a bargain (given the self-service and no silverware/china) but it's not a rip-off by any means.

Food. The meats were tasty but they cook them without sauce. I had lean brisket (which was pretty good) and baby back ribs. Being said that the meat is tasteful, the sauces are on the lame side. Nothing impressive and the hot and mild have a forgettable flavor.

Would I go back? Maybe.

Would I crave to go there? Absolutely not."}

I must say, it was definitely worth the wait! 

I went with the St. Louis style ribs and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The meat came off with a fork, just the way it's supposed to. As a side I ordered the green chile stew. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Friends went with the lean brisket, the chicken, and a brisket sandwich. We all enjoyed everything. The beer selection was good and it was nice that you could grab it while waiting in line. We also liked that you put the sauce on yourself, deciding how much or how little you wanted.  

Only 4 stars (or probably 3.5 really), because they were OUT of pulled pork! No pulled pork? We couldn't believe it. That and the sides were just okay: we had the stew, the cole slaw, and potato salad."}

Last night's dinner was the "make your own enchilada combo" option. Their enchiladas are always a winner with me. The chips are the best I've had at any Mexican restaurant, and they offer a sweet, hot, and mild dipping sauce for them. Topping off the meal were the dessert nachos. This is a plate of eight nachos with chocolate and caramel drizzle with a mini scoop of ice cream on each chip. That is the way to end a dinner on a high note.

Service and ambiance are exceptional every time."}

It's okay and I'm willing to try other items in the menu. Ordered Shrimp wrapped in Bacon Fajita. It was kind of disappointing for the price of 18.99. Sure price of shrimp went up this year, but still, for almost 20 bucks this dish is mediocre. Then, tasted "The Monterrey" for around 16-17 bucks I believe, I chose it cos it looked delish in the picture. Again, it was just okay but better than the Shrimp Fajita. Also ordered their Mucho Margarita, and that one was spot on. Will probably go here next time for happy hour and see what they offer. Service was borderline rude. I was with my parents that time, so I assumed I might whip up my ID just in case, and the server said " I dont need the ID, it's okay". Then I asked jokingly "why do I not look you ng anymore?!" (im 24 lol) and she said "no not anymore" with a couple of hahas. Gee, thankssss. But yeah anyway, minus that little situation, ambiance is pretty with fake coconut trees and cloud ceiling. Oh and btw, that skinny girl that's hostessing, don't put her there, she looked annoyed as hell on her job, not a very good start for the customers. But yeah, still Aok. Would go back for the drinks more so."}

Both types of brisket are full of smokey flavor, yet not over powering. And the lean meat is still super tasty, though not nearly as tender as the moist.

The pulled pork is amazing! Words cannot describe how my mouth is delighted with each bite-full. Simply ... yeah, WoW!

The Chicken, although a small bird ... is surprising tender, well cooked and not dry. How they get the smokey bbq flavor and not a dry bird astounds me!

As for the hospitality, it's no chik-fil a but it's darn close ... got to love southern hospitality"}

I'm not Arizona's biggest fan and I hope not to remain here for the rest of my life.  Every time I think I'm getting out of here, something happens and I get stuck.  Eventually, I'll escape this hell and make it back home.  
I miss everything about Texas.  The friendly people, the trees, grass in front yard, tubing on a river that actually moves, breakfast tacos, and barbeque.  Thank God, two of those things are here now!
I had stumbled onto Texas BBQ House and I admit, I loved it, but it's in a sketchy part of town that I'd rather not go to.  (And there's something wrong about eating barbeque out of crates in Scottsdale.)  At one point, my boyfriend and I actually contemplated making the 6 hour drive to El Paso to get some Rudy's.  Luckily, the next weekend a friend told us they were building a Rudy's!  Close to our house!  Down the street from where I was currently working!  
I think it was maybe 2 days after it opened before we finally made it down there and it was EXACTLY like walking into Rudy's that's 10 minutes away from my parent's house.  There's country music playing and Blue Bell ice cream and tubs full of every kind of Shiner you could ask for.  It felt like home.  Every time I go, I'm simultaneously elated to feel like I'm back in Texas and depressed to know I'm not.  
Everything on the menu is amazing.  I'm a big fan of lean brisket and jalapeno sausage, but seriously, there's nothing on that menu I won't eat.  I always get one of the big tubs of potato salad and that chocolate pudding will change your life. 
And, if you go in the morning, there's breakfast tacos!  This is the only place in Arizona that seems to know what a breakfast taco is and serves them!  It's a travesty that we live in a state with flour tortillas, but they refuse to make breakfast tacos or even figure out what they are!  
As for the reviewer complaining about the crates and deli paper and *gasp* having to refill their own drink!  This is Rudy's Texas style barbeque.  We're friendly folk and we don't mind sharing a table with strangers.  Texans will just strike up a conversation with the people next to them, or in line with them, or hell, a phone call placed to the wrong number.  If you don't like it, go next door to the unlucky folk who happened to open a barbeque place next door to this gem.   And how can a place that's been open 24 years and opens a new location that looks exactly the same as all of their others be copying a place that opened maybe a year ago?  I do believe Texas BBQ House is copying Rudy's, not the other way around.  Get it right.  
Bottom line, if you haven't tried Texas style barbeque, you need to go here.  Forget all the lame reviews from people that don't know better.  Just come and have the best meat of your life."}

I don't see McDonalds weighing their 1/4 pounders and charging you more because it's over a  1/4 of a pound. I paid 8.49 for what the menu said was 6.49. That's BS. Give me the right amount or less.

My fiancée and I decided to celebrate Mexican Independence Day with our first visit to our nearby Abuelo's.


The Plot:
We started by sharing the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and Seared Tuna appetizers.

That was followed by The Monterey, which consisted of a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada, Avocado Enchilada, Spinach Enchilada, Chicken Ranchera Enchilada, Cheese Chile Relleno, and a Crispy Chicken Taco.
We also ordered one of their September specials called The Hidalgo, which consisted of a Fajita Frite Relleno and Fajita Enchilada with Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans substituted for Mexican Rice and Refried Beans, respectively.

We concluded our meal by happily sharing a Chocolate Eruption.


The Scene:
We arrived at approximately 6pm on a busy and popular Saturday yet were seated within 15 minutes, which, in our experience, was quicker than average for a large franchise.

The chips with assorted salsa along with our beverages arrived soon thereafter.

The appetizers were the next pleasant surprise and both were enough for the two of us to share.
I was quite satisfied with the Seared Tuna despite it being somewhat more pricy compared to the other appetizers on the menu. We're both devoted fans of sushi and sashimi and the quality of the tuna, both in flavor and texture, was obviously better than we've experienced at most Asian restaurants. The mango relish, avocado, spicy mustard, and honey lime dressing complimented the fish very nicely.
The Stuffed Mushrooms were topped with a cheese sauce that was light and had a nice tomato flavor that went well with the spinach.

The Monterey was a generous quantity of food for the price and would have been enough for the both of us on its own. This was my first time trying a Spinach Enchilada and Avocado Enchilada and both were very good. I am also a Chile Relleno fan and I truly enjoyed the fresh, veggie flavor of the one that was served with assortment.

My fiancée thoroughly enjoyed her Relleno as well, which on the Hidalgo plate was stuffed with beef, and the Fajita Enchilada was stuffed with chicken. Both were flavorful, well seasoned, and she commented favorably on the delicate texture of the corn tortilla.
She was also very satisfied with the Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans, which nicely dressed up this plate more than the Mexican Rice and Refried Beans probably would have.

The Chocolate Eruption was a slight variation on the familiar molten chocolate cake or chocolate lava cake with which we've all been tempted before. We both liked this version very much because the hot chocolate sauce was poured on top rather than baked inside so the whole the cake was soft and moist. There was also enough ice cream and whipped cream for both of us to share. As restaurant franchises go, this was perhaps the best dessert experience we've had thus far this year.


The Rest of the Story:
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices very reasonable for this type of dining.

This was our first experience using Ziosk and I hope many more of our favorite restaurants will begin to implement this system. Be sure to tap the "Call Server" button when you're ready to order.


Epilogue:
We felt the quality of the food and the overall dining experienced deserved 3 stars and decided to upgrade our rating to 4 stars based on the good service, reasonable prices, and the chocolate dessert.

No doubt we will return the next time we're in the mood for Mexican.

It was not great, but OK. I decided to give the Chandler store a try. I had the moist brisket, and a jalapeno link. The brisket was mostly burnt to a crisp, and almost half was fat. I could not even chew through the link, and it was very greasy. The beans were plain. The white bread was stale. 

This is a HIGH priced self service BBQ joint. Everything is by the pound at the counter. No wait staff. Plastic silverware, and butcher paper is all they have. I would call this low class. Yes it may be what some call traditional, but I like to have real plates and silverware.

Back to the old standby Honeybears or Dave's"}

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is bc of the price; as with ALL BBQ restaurants, BBQ meat is not inexpensive but worth it, especially at Rudys. Compared to other local places or even high end "boutique" BBQ places, their prices are still very competitive and the product speaks for itself. The Moist Brisket is personal favorite, as for it "with black" and they will custom slice from the dark, rich, burned sides of the smoked brisket. I think one of the best points about Rudys...like other places, they don't nickel and dime you for sauces and condiments. VERY generous !"}

I like the nice smoky smell as you walk in and they will give you samples if you want to try something new.  I've recently discovered the pulled pork and sausages which are really moist and juicy.  Can't believe I just used those two words to describe food, but I don't know what else to say.

The ribs are also worth trying and I don't know anywhere else around here where you can order a Shiner Bock off the menu.  Prices are also pretty good.  You can have a filling meal for two for under $30 with drinks."}

Every store has a slightly different assortment of meats. In every Texas Rudys the Prime Rib was sold out by early lunch. So it was a great surprise when we were able to buy 1 and 1/2 pounds of outstanding medium rare Prime Rib. I can honestly say I have eaten Prime Rib at least 300 times and this would be in my top 5 ever. Afterwards we bought  another pound to take home.

In addition we had the moist brisket and the pork loin. Both of which were outstanding. Easily puts all AZ BBQ to shame.

As a note to the confused people out there... Lean Brisket means no fat and you want your brisket DRY! So stop complaining your LEAN DRY brisket is dry. You ordered it that way. Moist means extra fat and deliciousness. Otherwise normal is a mix of both."}

Service

First, never had bad service...never...That's difficult to pull off.  Yes it is a chain, but you really wouldn't know it.  

Today, we had an exceptionally great server Emily (don't know if that's how she spells it).  But she answered all of our questions and actually had opinions on what she liked and why.  

Food
Yes, the food here can be sporadic.  But it is never bad.  It is not always consistent. For example, sometimes you get a lot of chicken in your enchilada and sometimes you have to hunt for it.  

Today, as usual we both had enchilada combos.  Don't judge, we like them.  Wife and I tried two new enchiladas.  

I had the spinach enchilada.  I will be getting them again...and probably again.  Wife had the avocado enchilada.  We both liked the spinach (yes we shared) and she liked the avocado.  I hated it.  But I hate guacamole so it made sense I wouldn't like it. 

Wife also tried the pork enchiladas.  I think she liked them because I never saw one of them. 

If you like cheesy mashed potatoes and don't care about calories and fat because you are eating out, then you would be remiss not to enjoy their greatness.  

And of course...charro beans please. 

Summary
We like it here, warm friendly atmosphere.  They wait to make fun of you until you leave when you put a greedy amount of mints located at the front desk in your bag."}

He used to work in Chandler and would stop in frequently. Now he lives near Tucson and whenever he comes up north wants to meet at Rudy's for lunch or dinner. I've been several times with him, other family and friends. Definitely a favorite with the men in the party and big meat eaters. The smoked meats here are really good. The turkey is a little heavy on black pepper, but I still love it.

I first got turned onto the franchise by going to the original restaurant in Albuquerque (they even smoke trout there).

Unfortunately one time at the Chandler location I got the pulled pork sandwich and bit into not 1 but 2 big globs of fat. Eeewe! Now I know pork shoulder has a lot of fat because I make it myself. However they put the sandwich together right there and could see it when they made it. I eat meat, not fat sandwiches! I've been back since but now I stick with the chicken or turkey so I can see what I'm eating and not have it cloaked under a bun.

 In the morning they have inexpensive Tex Mex/Cowboy breakfast tacos and burritos. Those of you that need gluten free can request the ingredients in a bowl. Their beans are delicious with eggs, potatoes and cheese! You can customize yours from a list of ingredients. Sometimes after Easter they include ham as one of the picks. Yumm!"}

But I can tell you that I go there on a weekly basis to get my avocado enchiladas, papas and beans. Plus the chips and salsa are to die for. If you like hot ask the waiter or waitress to bring you the inferno sauce, it is the best but only available upon request. I have tried many other items on the menu and they are all awesome. My husband's favorite is the stuffed chicken medallions but he is always trying new specials and they never disappoint. If you have not tried Abuelo's you are missing out on some incredible food."}

They serve breakfast tacos daily from open till 10 am and you're able to add in items if you get there before 10, if you're after 10 because you slept in, it's still okay because they have the breakfast tacos ready to go in a heater right by the cash register, it will always be a perfect moment for you."}

Their menu is simple and they stick to the basics. Meats are available by the half pound, and include 4 slices of bread for a 1/2 pound order. Sides include coleslaw, potato salad, creamed corn, green chile stew, new potatoes, and corn on the cob (Just to name a few!). 

I liked that they had different options for your brisket. Usually at bbq places I go to it is typically the "lean" brisket you get, but here at Rudy's you can decide between "moist" (AKA fatty) brisket, lean brisket, and "Chef's choice" brisket (I'd imagine this to be the leftover bits of what is carved, since it's cheaper than the other options). 

As this was our first time here, the cashier gave us a sample of the lean brisket and the turkey. Both were very flavorful and moist. I'd definitely get either meat in the future. As for my actual meal, I opted for the moist brisket with a side of green chile stew. The order was made quickly.

After you pay, there is a station for condiments that include various peppers, onions, pickles, and packets of sauces (Ketchup, mustard, horseradish). There are also straws and napkins here. The soda fountain is stocked with Coke products, and they also offer sweet and unsweetened tea.

Seating is self serve, and we found a cozy little wooden table stocked with various hot sauces, a "sissy" sauce, and a regular bbq sauce. The regular bbq sauce had a nice vinegary tang, with a slight kick of spice. The "sissy" sauce to me tasted very similar, except not as hot spice-wise. 

The moist brisket was indeed very moist, with unctuous veins of fat running through the meat. I could taste a deep smoky flavor too. The green chile stew was excellent. It was served piping hot, with a superb savory, spicy flavor. 

Overall, a nice place to go for some good bbq. I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their bbq meats!"}

My wife and I will usually order the "skinny" margaritas which have less sweetness than the regular margaritas. I have tried multiple entrees and have never been disappointed. I especially like the tilapia. Service is usually quick, even on busy nights. Food is of good quality, prepared well, and nicely plated.

The chips are paper thin.  The fajitas aren't really seasoned and come with tons of onions and not enough peppers.  Tiny plate of toppings.  On the bright side my friend and I recently split an order of these bland fajitas with extra chicken, which was plenty of food and just a few bucks more for the extra chicken.  

We've been here before, so on our way out we were kind of looking around for the yummy buttermints that are normally sitting out in a bowl.  Upon request, we were each given a handful from a huge box hidden behind the host stand.   Why weren't they out - the hostesses didn't want to share??

We were so happy when they opened this Rudy's in Chandler. We live in the West Valley so it's over an hour to get there, but we get our "Rudy's fix" every so often. 
The Smoked turkey it heavenly, love the brisket & jalapeño sausage   For sides we go for the beans and potato salad. The cold slaw is good also but we run out of room:). 

Hear they have plans to open a store in Goodyear or Avondale next year. That would be super!!!"}

The food we received from Rudy's BBQ made me sign up for a Yelp account to post because it was so terrible!  After hearing about this place I assumed we would give it a try as we like BBQ and it is close to our house.  It is clearly overrated!  My husband did take out since we have a 2 year old and going out to eat lately is near impossible.  He had to wait in line for at least 20 minutes on a Sunday evening.  
We both ordered brisket sandwiches.  When I unwrapped my sandwich it looked great with a lot of meat, that is until I took the bun off to add sauce.  There was so much fat on this sandwich, more fat than actual meat.  I took a picture of it because I was so disgusted.  My husband said that he even asked for extra lean meat.  After pulling out the fat I ate most of the sandwich.  The meat wasn't great, a little dry.  I ended up eating my 2 year old's Costco chicken nuggets which were way better than the sandwich!  We will stick with Joe's BBQ, Tom's BBQ, and Famous Daves!"}

Picture this: shopping in Caesar's Palace with recessed fluorescent lighting trimming a domed ceiling, Dia De Los Muertos and Latin artistic touches in the plentiful paintings (including a pairs shot of Frida Kahlo and Alejandro Gómez Arias), many well-appointed nooks for dining with relative separation from the din, and hints of rural Spanish cathedrals.

Only a verbose description properly corrals the elements of this experience - a feast for the eyes. That is only matched by the feast found on their menu. I position my rating by saying that the food is slightly more traditional, with less focus on fusion combos and more on the individual flavors of key ingredients. I recommend the layered dip, with seasoned ground beef, melted queso, guac, sour cream and peppers. A lovely starter that is easily shared by two. And the complementary salsa is above average, with a well-thought-out single serving bowl per person.

The Green Chile Stew (while John, our server, raved about it) was ok. I love spice; however, the black pepper overpowered the green chiles. The beef was tender but sinewy at points; and the potatoes seemed an afterthought, having not fully absorbed the flavor of the sauce. I wanted to try the Cilantro Lime (chicken with pozole), but it was not available on that visit.

Also, the Espinaca Casserole had some great spinach but only one piece of mushroom and no noticeable peppers, as promised on the menu. Oddly, it included corn, which was not mentioned. Won't venture there again.

My dinner companion had the "linebacker's meal," as she called it (saving the leftovers for her hubby). It was the well-priced $14.95 Monterrey, with sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole. The plate was scorching and the selection was amazing; something worth testing with a friend. She said it was all good but not terribly memorable.

Highlight of the trip was the service. I would have likely come back to try other selections, like some of the seafood dishes and margaritas; still, the hospitality, the attentiveness, the genuine listening skills and the efficiency will definitely make this a repeat venue.

So, be sure to sample a sampler and take a leisurely walk around the restaurant to acquaint yourself with the art, statues and murals. Tell Frida, I said "hi.""}

I think this caused me to set my expectations so high that when I finally did eat at Rudy's, I was expecting to be absolutely blown away.  To be quite honest, I was disappointed and was not all that impressed.  Little Miss BBQ is hands down still the #1 BBQ place in Arizona in my book.

Rudy's is not a difficult place to find since the restaurant is tan, yellow, and red.  The place is spacious with plenty of parking, plenty of outdoor seating as well and indoor seating.

There is a little store inside the place to the left where you can buy the BBQ sauces, candy, wine, Rudy's shirts, drinks, etc.  

As far as the actual restaurant goes, if you have never been to Rudy's before, it is basically set up like a school cafeteria.  You get in line to purchase your food at the counter.  While in line and heading toward the counter, you can grab bottled drinks, sides in containers from the fridge, and etc.  Once you have reached the counter, that is where you will order your main dishes and sides.  If you have never been to Rudy's before or are undecided on what to get, feel free to ask for samples!  The customer service that we received at the counter was excellent and very pleasant.  After sampling different items, my bf and I ended up ordering brisket moist, spicy chop with sauce, ribs, jalapeño sausages, and potato salad to share.  All of our food was placed in a plastic tray/crate thingie magig that you normally use to store bottled sodas.  

Once you have your food, you go and find yourself a table to sit down and eat.  From here on out, everything is self serve.  There are stations where you can grab napkins and white butcher paper which acts as your "plate."  You just spread it out on the table, place some food on there and feast!  

On each of the tables are Rudy's BBQ sauces which are gluten free!  There's a spicy sauce and a mild sauce for the sissies who cannot handle spicy sauces.  The sauce is really called the Sissy sauce!  Don't worry though, the spicy BBQ sauce didn't really have any heat so you should definitely try it out without the fear of burning your tongue off.  The BBQ sauces did not impress me.  It tasted just like any regular BBQ sauce that you can get at a store.  There was nothing special about the sauces.

The brisket moist I'm assuming is supposed to be moist since the word is in the name but it was not moist.  In fact, it was more on the dry side and not tender.  I drowned the brisket in the BBQ sauce just to moisten it up a bit.  This was disappointing considering brisket is the number one item that I order at BBQ joints.  The spicy chop with sauce was good and I think it would taste good in between hamburger buns.  The ribs were okay.  The jalapeño sausages were good flavor wise since I like spicy foods, but once again, the sausages were more on the dry side.  As far as the sides go, the potato salad, coleslaw, and etc. all tasted like average sides that you can buy in large quantities at the store.  Nothing special about the sides.  

As mentioned before, it is self serve after you get your food and start eating.  This means that after you are done eating, you have to clean up after yourself before you leave. 

Overall, the customer service was excellent, the prices average, and the food was just okay.  I wouldn't come back to Rudy's unless this was the only BBQ joint that was open and I was desperately craving BBQ.  There are way better BBQ places out there that I would go to first."}

I went there last week around 12:30- they were giving the breakfast taco's away, that never happens before you wait in line to buy food.  They are generous with the protein and you will discover lunch costs more at McDonald's.

So far my favorite is the turkey and I'm not a bird fan at all.  For the most part I go out of my way to eat any chicken or turkey outside of home because I'm always disappointed with how dry it is.  This is NOT dry and very flavorful.

I've tried the pork ribs and the baby back ribs and like both.  I didn't even need to add sauce for the flavor they are rubbed with is plenty.

They have cream corn here and although in reality I know this is really only gravy with some corn I'm in love.  This version is very very very good.

I am not, however, impressed with the brisket.  Although flavorful it is very dry.  Not worth it to me."}

Depending on what cuts you like, the prices will vary and the better the meat meant the more the price but not by much. They also had the perfect sides to go with your juicy and succulent BBQ. I perfectly enjoyed the brisket moist because the extra fat on that piece added extra flavor. In addition to this, I also got a side of corn on the cob and cole slaw and it made the BBQ all come together. In total, I probably paid ~$15 and I think it was reasonable for what I got. An important thing that all BBQ places need to have are their own special sauces and this place did have that. I always enjoy drenching my cut of meats in those sauces. There wasn't any real downside of Rudy's but I do wish that they offered a variety of meats for a cheaper price. When I come to these types of places, I enjoy sampling different meats because each place has a distinct flavor that shows on their food."}

First off, this is highly gringified Mexican food, mellowed out for the more sensitive gringo palates of suburban Chandler (right up professor's alley, as he's from Indiana). If you want the real thing, go to Guadalupe, or better yet, South Tucson. That said, the food wasn't bad at all, in fact, it was quite good. Frozen margaritas packed a punch, and the place is quite charming, with lots of hanging potted plants and colorful murals. Service was prompt and polite. Whether its totally worthy of being a self-proclaimed embassy of cuisine is in doubt, but Abuelo's is definitely reasonable, given the price."}

Maybe because we're used to the real stuff in Texas and Oklahoma. We have no idea how this place was popular in Texas. But, the place is just adorable and the staff is just wonderful. Liked the long picnic table style seating and it's nice that they have a separate area with smaller families. Great for large groups as long as they like the food.

We were so excited to try it and it has been on our very short list of restaurants to try for months, but my husband and I both work 60 hours a week and rarely have a time where we get off in time where they are open. So on Friday, we were so excited when we got off at 9:30 pm and their website clearly states they are closed at 10:30, so we drove 30 minutes to get there at 10:00 pm. We walked in and the guy says we are closed, it says so on the door. Well, we wouldn't know that it says that on the door because we have never been there before and the website clearly states they close at 10:30 pm, as well as on google. Horrible customer service to reject someone and say the time we close is on the door, when it states it online. They should really fix it online then if they changed it on the door, because who drives all the way there to look at the door for their times. I don't know how to post a screenshot of the times listed on their website, but I have it as proof. Having worked in the customer service industry for years, the better way to handle this after someone telling you they drove 30 minutes because it says online that you close at 10:30 and not at 10:00, would be to apologize and try to remedy the situation such as selling us what they had left (which they would have probably thrown away anyways) or just a plain old fashion apology would have sufficed instead of arguing and saying the time is on the door. Who cares? It's listed online, it's 2017, it's what people rely on is information online."}

Ended up there at the odd time of too late for lunch, too early for dinner so they were not very busy. Our server, wish I remembered his name, was EXCELLENT. He brought us the normal salsa, then offered the habanero salsa.... gave great recommendations on dishes to order and when decided he had great suggestions on how to "customize" them. BF had the taco and enchilada plate, beef crunchy taco and chicken enchilada with the spinach cheesy thing and the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are excellent, the spinach cheesy thing excellent.. mix the two and it is beyond yum. Beef was well seasoned and chicken nice and tender. I opted for the 2 enchilada plate with one chicken one shredded beef. Server recommended the velveeta cheese on the beef which I opted for but ended up scraping off.. the flavor of the "cheese" overwhelmed the beef. The beef was nice and tender, well seasoned and the chicken was the same. I had the cilantro rice and black beans. The black beans were well seasoned and delish, I could have eaten a huuuuuuuuge bowl."}

I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned."}

I know that there are regional disputes and tastes about BBQ and that there are rib and sausage and pork people from Up North.....and DAMMIT, it is the rub NOT the sauce!

My favorites while we were here were the Spicy Chopped, the ribs (every kind was good) and that chocolate pudding. That chocolate pudding has oreos in it!!! So good. On top of all that they have a pickle and pepper bar. That's right ALL YOU CAN EAT PICKLES! Gotta love that BBQ and pickle combo! 

If you're stopping by in the morning for their Breakfast tacos know that they are big enough to turn into a respectable breakfast burrito with the right folding technique and the Spicy Chopped bbq breakfast taco is the best, you can try the others but I've already done the work for you- go spicy chopped!

This location also offers prime rib and it's only $9.99 for a 1/2 pound... pretty reasonable and it has great flavor.

My husband and I finally decided to check out Rudy's. It was beyond our expectations. The atmosphere is like a backyard BBQ at a friend's home. The seating is all picnic tables with bottle top openers and napkin holders all over the walls. 

First about the ordering, it is just like ordering at a fast food counter but so far from fast food. We had to stand in a line but getting the food wasn't any longer than what we would experience at a sit down restaurant. You wait in line and can pick your drinks and sides along the way. Once you get to the counter you tell them if you want any hot sides and what kind of meat you want. They get it ready right there as you wait. The food comes out on wax paper and in a crate and the meat is being cut right where you can see it. It is a different format from any other restaurant I have been in but I liked it. The meat is put in front of you on a scale like at a butcher shop but it is already cooked.  

I had the pulled pork sandwich and I could tell it was slow cooked to perfection. It doesn't come with BBQ sauce but there are two big jars at your table to add. My husband had the turkey sandwich and it looked like it was cut right off the bone. He said it was the best turkey sandwich he ever had. Nothing is done fancy there, it is all about the meat. 

I will go back many more times."}

The first thing that I like about Abuelos is that it doesn't look like your typical Mexican Restaurant. I hate it when they over exaggerate the Mexican theme. Abuelos does it right with a courtyard feel ambiance. 

The food is amazing. They have one of the best beef fajitas I have ever tasted. They also have various flavors of enchiladas that are very good.

Depending on time of day, you will experience a wait time to get a table which means there will be a wait time for your food. Don't worry, they provide chips and salsa and they are good. The food is definitely worth the wait."}

As soon as I got home I was beyond sick. I had gotten food poisoning. I was upset about it because I typically love Rudy's food and the service and have never experienced this.

1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

OK, yeah, so Rudy's is a chain.  But it's a chain in the same way that Mastro's is a chain.  The fact that they've expanded way past San Antonio doesn't make it any less delicious.

Texas style BBQ here, specifically Hill Country, smoking with oak.  Butcher paper, meat to order by the pound, sliced white bread.  This doesn't measure up to the best BBQ in the country, but it is very good BBQ.  My three favorite meats are the moist brisket, the jalapeno sausage, and the ribs.  Everything else tastes pretty average to me, and the sauce, I can take it or leave it.  Actually, compared to some other BBQ joints, I think their sauce is pretty weak.  The spicy isn't quite spicy enough, and the mild has this almost watery aftertaste that's a little off-putting.  If they have the prime rib, it is also just OK.  I don't think I'd pay the premium for it when there's other great meat on the menu.

Their sides are better than most BBQ joints.  The creamed corn is pretty tasty, the beans are average.  I'm still undecided on the green chile - it's hearty and filling but lacks green chile.

They also have banana pudding which, if you get one that's been sitting for a while, the Nilla wafers have soaked up some of the moisture of the pudding and the flavor, the outside is a little mushy but the inside still has some crunch so when you dig into it, you get texture with the creaminess of the pudding and banana.  Granted, you can't tell by looking, but you could get lucky.

So if you don't want to wait in line for good Texas BBQ (like at Little Miss), this is the place to go.  Finally, two words - pickle bar."}

My son was not a fan of the baby back ribs. Cole slaw is OK,  not anything to write home about but nobody goes to a BBQ joint just for the cole slaw. 
All together, we liked the food and will definitely be back the next time we are in the Phoenix area."}

After I had posted here I had also commented on Abuelo's Website. I was contacted by the Assistant General Manager via E-mail a few days later. She asked if we could talk by phone. So I gave her my phone number and she called me the next day. 
She apologized sincerely about the terrible service and food we received and said she would send me 4 VIP Vouchers for free meals.
Her name is Jennifer Dils and she followed through on her promise. 
So we went back on Friday, April 3rd, 2015. We were promptly seated and it wasn't until our server, his name is Will, came to our table to ask for our drink order that I gave him the free meal cards and asked for Mrs. Dils. She came to our table shortly and introduced herself. Mrs. Dils was extremely professional and courteous and it was truly a pleasure meeting her.
Will, even before meeting Mrs. Dils, was very nice and quick and throughout our entire visit was very attentive, without disturbing our little party. 
We had brought my Son along and again, my parents. 
My Father and I had opted for the Chicken Fajitas, The Chicken was juicy, well seasoned, the Onions and Bells underneath it nice and translucent.
My Mom had the Fajita Burito with the Chicken and Chili Con Queso on top. She really enjoyed her meal. The only thing was that she ordered all Rice and received Rice and Beans. But that was not such a big deal. 
My Husband and Son both had the Ribeye & Enchilada and chose the Cheese Enchilada. They asked for the Ribeye to be medium rare and it may have been just a tad more rare, but they both loved it.
We had the Guacamole and Chili Con Queso for the appetizer. Both were delicious, loved the Guacamole the most. We had it on our last visit and again, we were not disapointed.  The Salsa this visit around, was very good, it was not runny like it was on our previous visit. The only thing I don't care for is the Green Salsa. It is a little to sweet for my taste, buy my Dad liked it. 

Overall, this was the Abuelos I remember and we will definitely return again. I hope the excellent service and food will become the norm again and want to thank the Assistant Manager Mrs. Dils once more for addressing our complaint and making sure that all was well. She even came at the end of our meal to check on us. 

Thank you Abuelo's for what turned out to be a great return visit."}

I choose the three ground beef tacos on soft corn torts. Most gluten free torts aren't soft, so I questioned that before ordering. Also, I wanted to substitute the meat for carne asada as I am not a fan of ground beef but the waiter said that they put MSG in their carne asada. Yuck, I thought and decided to stick with ground beef. They were okay, nothing special. They do have yummy green mild salsa though, which was better than my entire dinner. Service was great. I haven't heard that a Mexican restaurant uses MSG in their food before though. My friend order their chicken and steak fajitas, she said it was okay. I wondered though if her meat had MSG too.

I ordered a brisket sandwich, jumbo baked potato, and half pound of chicken. My sister ordered the prime rib, jumbo baked potato, and a corn on the cob. All I have to say is OMG!!!!! Pricing for what we got was $42 but it was well worth it!! They give you so much food it was amazing!!! Everything from the brisket to the chicken to the potato was amazing. The brisket was soft and flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Everything according to the employees is cooked fresh and served that same day!! You can definitely tell by the way the food tasted and the tenderness of everything. I would highly recommend this place a 100%!! Also recommend bringing your family if you have a lot of relatives or members because they do serve you a lot of food. You will not be disappointed when you eat here. Also the employees are super friendly and if it's your first time they guide you on what you need to do. Also the service is quick you may wait in line for  2-5 mins but the minute you get to the ordering register you pretty much get served on the spot and then grab your food and find a seat.

Unfortunately, the quality and consistency has dropped pretty badly these past 2 months.  The brisket will range from awesome (ie full of flavor, moist) to extremely bland and dry.  The ribs are generally cooked well, but the spice rub will range from a nice even taste to having the rub so thick that you can scrape off a few tablespoons from just 4 ribs.  During our last trip, we heard some customers saying that they also noticed the inconsistency, and they said it was because the more senior (and better) BBQ pit masters have started working at their new location on the West side of town.

We also noticed that their business is starting to hurt in the evenings... used to have long lines Friday/Saturday nights, now it's a piece of cake getting your food.

I hope management is reading this, and take this to heart.  My family very much enjoyed Rudy's when they actually cared about what they served - but now we've been forced to find other go-to places (Little Miss Barbecue is by far the best, but unfortunately they are not open in the evenings)."}

I had a chicken fajita chimichanga, not what I expected. Could have been decent if prepared the correct way. There was one large pepper on top of few cubes of chicken, all wrapped in a doughy tortilla. And, quite honestly, it very well could have been pre-made and reheated upon ordering. It was definitely not fresh tasting. The beans tasted like they were straight from a can and the rice was dry and flavorless. Both remained on my plate. My husband and I split an order of nachos, which we actually laughed at when it was delivered to the table. Not quite what we were expecting. It was five pieces of halved corn tortillas with a sprinkle of meat and melted cheese.   When we order nachos, we expect actual nachos; not floppy melted cheese. My margarita was good, but for $10, I expect more than 3 or 4 sips from my glass. Very chintzy.

Country Store added BarBQ to their grocery store. There was no inside seating and no air-conditioning. You sat outdoors next to the fire and usually smelled like wood smoke when you left. Soon there were lines out the open-air counter and ranch hands and dentists stood in line with all the other lovers of fine Texas BarBQ. I thought I had died and gone to heaven when Steve Freidkin, owner of TexAz Grill told me (at the Robert Earl Keen concert) Phoenix had a Rudy's. I was in line the next day for lunch! Almost everything felt like home and many others thought so too. The line snaked thru the restaurant and out the door. Just like home. I give it a 99%, the only concern was that the brisket tasted like it had been cooked in a new pit--WHICH IT HAD!  Takes time to season the pit with lots of good wood and smoke from the meat to produce the right flavor. But, its pretty dang close!  Closest thing to authentic anywhere in AZ."}

Their breakfast tacos (which they serve every day from 7-10 AM) are a great way to start the day! You can special order them at the counter if you have a little more time (which is what we do because I am not especially fond of the egg inside) or you can buy them pre made. 

Their brisket, bacon and cheese or turkey bacon and cheese tacos are the best... yes, I said turkey! You can get a great low calorie turkey taco for breakfast with lots of protein!  

Their meats are so amazing you will not even need the bbq sauce!  Not to mention their green chili stew! And I can't even count the times I have purchased their sausage and turkey to take home to drop into my home made jambalaya! 

The only reason I did not give Rudys a full 5 stars is because while their meats are so delicious,  we are not crazy about their bbq sauce. But don't let this deter you. This place is well worth a try!"}

The loaded baked potato is huge, and the corn on the cob was cooked properly. 

So why am I giving it only 3 stars? Because despite being called Texas BBQ, their sauces and even the pulled pork without sauce had strong vinegar flavors, and I'm just not a vinegar fan - that's what I consider Carolina BBQ. It's a good BBQ joint but not to my taste preference."}

Just as it was back home, Rudy's continues to offer delicious BBQ at a great price. 

I'm a sucker for their brisket (usually dealer's choice between moist, a bit fattier, and lean, less fat), and the jalapeño sausage. The brisket is never dry and seasoned/smoked to perfection, and the sausage has just the right amount of spiciness. They also have ribs and pulled pork, plus the chicken is also fantastic, if red meat isn't your thing. 

Sides like the potato salad and cream corn are wonderful compliments to your meal, but go with the jumbo baked potato if you're feeling famished - it's fit for a giant. You can even add any meat if your choice and make a meal of it on its own. 

Rudy's offers ample indoor and outdoor (enclosed patio) seating, and is a great breakfast/lunch/dinner spot for your whole family. Wait..breakfast you say?? Yea, Rudy's also has breakfast tacos that are AMAZING! In case you miss out on getting them in the AM, sometimes you get lucky and they still have a few when you go for lunch. #Winning"}

I'm going to keep this short and simple.  Come here for the meat and skimp on the sides.  I liked that they were willing to give you samples of the meat so you could pick what you liked the best; we ended up with both lean and moist beef brisket and pork ribs.  For sides we got corn on the cob, coleslaw and baked beans.  The corn almost ruined the experience for me.  I saw the woman pull a corn on the cob on a stick out of some container and pour two laddles of melted butter over it....sick, but that wasn't even the worst part about it.  Once we sat down to eat I decided to start the meal off with the corn, I took one bite and thought it tasted really odd.  Visually you could see this wasn't fresh.  I had my fiance take a bite of it and he got a really disgusted look on his face, looked at the bottom of the corn and showed me a huge brown ring.  They served ROTTEN corn.  Ugh!  Thankfully the meat was delicious and saved this place from a 1 star review.  The beans and coleslaw were both decent but tasted store bought."}

Used to go here all the time when visiting friends and family in and around the Austin area. Just learned about this AZ location from one of my vendors at work and had to go check them out right away.

Texas BBQ is so much different than what you get in KS, NC, or other areas of this great nation. The big secret is that most of the flavors in TX come from the dry rubs and the hardwood that they use to smoke the meat. You do not need super sweet sauces to cover up this treasure. They use Oak here and it has a stronger flavor profile than many of the other tamer woods used at other places.

I'm a sucker for Brisket and always order some of the Moist cut. It has more fat and is my favorite. They also offer a Leaner cut for those watching their figure. The Jalapeno Sausage is also a special treat and you will surely see it on my plate. They also serve Pork, Ribs, Chicken, Turkey and several tasty sides to go with your meal. They even have Dessert.

Everything here is counter service and you basically walk up and order the meats by the pound. They have all the free fixins that you may need in a large area off to the side. You do not see that much out here. Brings back that good old TX feeling of being back home.

Don't forget to check out the really cool Country Store up front. They serve some very delicious Breakfast Tacos for less than two bucks during the morning rush. Get here early for lunch or at off times to avoid the large crowds. Small nap afterwards may be required. OH YEAH!

I'm from Austin, Texas so I'm jacked that Rudy's is now Chandler!  I'm a big fan of Texas style BBQ and haven't found BBQ in Phoenix that compares.   This Rudy's store is basically the same as those found in Texas but there's no gas station.   The store theme is no-frills "country",  the seating is picnic tables.   Wait in line, order at the counter and buy the meats by the pound.   You can order whatever weight you want, so don't feel like you have to buy a whole pound.   I like to get a 1/4 pound lean brisket and 1/4 pound turkey and a side.   You have your choice of complimentary white or wheat bread slices, just tell them how many slices you need.  Your food is placed on butcher's paper (not plates) and is set in a big plastic crate which you take to your table.   Two types of BBQ sauce are located on the tables in large bottles with a shaker top.   The sauce is a peppery ketchup based product.   There's also a condiment bar with pickles, onions, peppers if you want them.   When you're done eating there's a big hand washing station with a metal trough under it (don't accidentally mistake this for a stadium urinal!)    

This AZ store has a several new menu additions that I've never seen in the Austin stores:  pulled pork, sandwiches, cobbler, 3 bean salad, and baked potato.    I tried the pulled pork and loved it.   

Oh and here's the BIG kicker:  BREAKFAST TACOS in the a.m.!!!!!!    I've sorely missed my beloved breakfast tacos.  Anyone from Texas knows what I'm talking about.    Why the heck nobody does breakfast tacos outside of Texas I'll never understand.  Phoenix just got a little better."}

Service was lacking, we had to stop our server to get our apps ordered and then again to order our entrees. I ran out of water and beer, and I wasn't the only one in our party waiting on drinks. The biggest complaint would be we could not order a shredded beef burro deep fried. Yep, you heard correctly a mexican food place that cant/wont deep fry a burro. Chicken, yes, but not the beef. no explanation from the server, just, "we don't do that". We went as a birthday dinner and sadly the bday boy could not get what he wanted.  Lousy experience."}

This Texas girl does enjoy brisket and BBQ sauce, so I am super happy that there's a Rudy's in the Phoenix area.

There's often a line when you go in, but use the time to get familiar with the menu. You can order half pound portions of meat, pick up sides in the fridge by the counter, and grab a beer or other bottled beverage (soda, water, etc.) while standing in line.

Personally, I like getting a brisket sandwich. I usually skip sides since they're just OK and the brisket is more than enough to fill me up. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. The brisket isn't too fatty, the buns are fresh, and the smoky flavor of delicious goodness is awesome.

I like picking up jalapenos and onions before pouring BBQ sauce over my sandwich. If you don't like spicy BBQ sauce, use the sissy version. Regular has a nice little kick if that's what you're into.

Overall, super good. Give Rudy's a go!"}

I tried the pork. It was juicy and just delicious. Their sauce is at each table so you can go nuts with it if you'd like. 
I like how the food is served in industrial plastic trays, like the kinds used for soda 2 liters. They make sure you know they aren't messing around.

This was my first visit to Rudys and it was BOMB! Driving up to this place you can smell the the smokiness and barbecue aroma in the air. 

We arrived just in time before it got busy and the lines long. The menu was simple with just meats and sides. I had the 1/2lb brisket and a cup of green chile stew. Brisket was tender full of flavor and delicious. The stew was delicious and would definitely have it again. The portions are big and it comes with 4 slices of white bread. So it was very filling and did I mention you can sample an item before buying it?  

This place is organized with a table full of condiments, large bench tables for plenty of seating and a little store inside. They've also got a huge sink to clean up after your meal. If you're an ice tea or lemonade person, they sell it by the gallon to take home. Awesome!

If you're a barbecue person or not, give Rudys barbecue a try. You'll be glad you did. Get there early though to beat the dinner rush and avoid the long lines. Oh yea, be sure to pick yourself up some rice crispy treats from there. They're so good. They say they go fast and after trying one, I bought 3 more."}

It's receiving 4 stars due the dearth of BBQ joints in the Phoenix metro and people are so desperate for BBQ that this place gets rave reviews. Honestly, I think Honey Bears is far better. There are several flaws with this place. The pulled pork comes with NO BBQ sauce; yes it's served dry and mushy and you have to apply your own. I've never been to a BBQ place where the pulled pork is not served in sauce. The ribs are tiny and the meat does not fall off the bone; the meat is actually quite tough. For pork ribs, the meat is supposed to fall of the bone and be tender and succulent. The baked beans had no flavor. 

There is no chicken on the menu, only turkey.

The sauce itself is underwhelming. They seem to be preoccupied with the idea that "heat" or spiciness makes for a better sauce. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We are talking about BBQ sauce not salsa. The best sauces have flavor not heat. Their "sissy" sauce was actually their better sauce. Their "original sauce" has too much crushed red pepper and almost has salsa like undertones.

Finally, the fact that you don't get a container of sauce when you order take-out is bush league. They have these tiny packets of sauce that resemble tiny packets of butter or margarine at a diner.  Any respectable BBQ establishments gives you a container of sauce to go with your food. And unfortunately, you need more than a container since their food is pretty dry and devoid of sauce. 

Sorry but Phoenix deserves better."}

I love a good smoke ring and charred bits of that taste in my mouth is heavenly. That being the case, I am also fairly critical of barbecue restaurants; especially when I have partaken in a feast of awesome barbecue at Rudy's original location off of Boerne Stage Road in San Antonio. This location in Chandler does not miss a beat.

We had the prime rib, moist brisket, and pork ribs. They all had that signature smokey taste and the meat was tender. The pork ribs didn't take much work to get the meat off the bone and the prime rib was on the rare side, just how I like it. Some people prefer to throw that signature sauce all over the place. I choose to poor it into one of their picnic boats and dip my meat in it. 

For a side we had their great tasting cream corn. For those of you that scoff at creamed corn, this is not your subpar can of cream corn that you buy off the supermarket shelves. No, this was prepared well and the heavy cream concoction was sweet and, of course, creamy. 

We left full and on our way out, we were informed by one of their cheerful and helpful servers that they serve breakfast tacos made to order and some more common variations in a grab-n-go bin. Looks we'll be trying that out tomorrow morning. 

One thing that I do miss from the original store that was not carried over to this location is the smell of the smokers that soaks into your clothes and gives you a subtle reminder of the meal you enjoyed earlier that day."}

It is not a "sit-down" restaurant, but a counter service establishment. They serve all meats either by weight or in sandwich form. We did not realized that when we made our initial decision to dine there, but serving by weight is actually pretty useful. It allows for a variety of items to be ordered. You are not tied down to a full meal of just one type of meat. They offer a variety of options such as chicken, pork, beef, turkey, sausage, and even prime rib (although they seem to sell out of the prime rib quickly). Both my fiance and I tried the spicy chopped brisket. Very, very good. I believe that it is their only beef option that is already soaked in BBQ sauce. They serve most, if not all of their meats plain, and allow you to add the BBQ sauce at the table. The spicy chopped brisket was very tender and moist and had a great flavor. 
We really only had two major complaints. 
1. Only two choices of BBQ sauce 
2. Very limited side dish options. No mac & cheese, no mashed potatoes. Unless you like beans, coleslaw, or corn on the cob you are pretty much out of luck. We did try the red potatoes but they were far from stellar. Just boiled red potatoes cubes in a pool of butter. No seasoning. 
Overall the main dish was great, but I would pass on the side dishes next time.   I will definitely be back to try out some of their other meats."}

We met some friends here for a going away party and everyone around the table loved the food. The line on a weekend night is long, but well worth the wait. It is very much a family style, no plates, eat with your fingers type of experience so plan accordingly. 

I decided on the pulled pork sandwich and a side of potato salad. The pulled pork was delicious. Served without BBQ sauce so you can add your own. The pulled pork was moist and tender and could have definitely been eaten without BBQ sauce if that's your thing, it's definitely not mine, the more sauce the better. They have two sauce choices. Rudy's original BBQ sauce or Rudy's Sissy Sauce. I of course went for the original seeking some spice and it did not disappoint. It was delicious! The potato salad was just okay, not great, not bad. The pulled pork sandwich with loads of sauce was delicious. This girl didn't mind getting her hands dirty for some good BBQ!

Overall good experience. I will be back for more. From what I hear they have amazing BBQ breakfast tacos which sound different and delicious. I will be back to try those."}

If you read my reviews, you will note that the food and the experience are equally important to me.  In this case they both measured up well!
The hostess was very gracious to us "rookies", explaining the process clearly.  It is best described as organized chaos!  The food is served like a fast food restaurant - walk up counter, walk away with your meal.  But it is anything but fast food.
I had the brisket lean (they also offer brisket moist) and found it to.be good - not great but I would order it again.  My buddy said the pulled pork was extremely good.  They offer a variety of sauces at the table but don't be afraid - none were particularly fiery.
The seating is first come-first serve at long tables - so don't expect private seating, although one section does offer a few picnic tables for 4-6 people.
Overall a very enjoyable night with good food and good atmosphere.  One last note - we arrived at 5:45 pm on a Saturday and walked right in.... but by 7 pm the line was out the door and down the sidewalk (with parking equally congested).  Go early!"}

Our issues are as follows..
Food has no flavor
No kids menu for picky kids, except when the cashier finally told us off the menu is grilled cheese sandwich. Every time we asked a question about the menu i.e. Do you have cornbread? No! Do you have fries? No! I'm very surprised for a BBQ establishment no cornbread nor fries (potato wedges) are on the menu
BBQ Sause has too much vinegar

My friend from out of state had been telling me about this place for years,  so when they finally opened up the Chandler location I was totally stoked.   On my first visit,  we were a little disappointed with the no plates thing,  but once we dug into the food,  we forgot about that quick.   The potato salad is one of the better sides, and their beans are great too. The brisket (sold by the 1/2 pound) has a smokiness that permeates your senses and makes you want to eat the entire portion by yourself! But don't be selfish,  sharing a little with your dining companion will give you shared stories of BBQ excellence for years to come. And if you happen to have friends the live where there are no Rudy's and keep frothing at the mouth every time you even mention the name,  remind them they will ship brisket anywhere in the USA. 

And remember the breakfast tacos! Brisket with egg and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla... Man oh man are they good. Just get there before 9am on the weekends,  otherwise you may miss out."}

I had tried Rudy's in NYC during the BBQ fest a few different times and remembered liking it, so I was stoked to learn they had a location outside of Austin. Some aspects of this place are fabulous, but some make me want to run away and never return. BF and I ordered food to take home from here after a trip to IKEA (we both needed a reward for surviving that place on a Sunday!). We ordered: 1 potato w/Moist Brisket, 1 side of stew, 1 pulled pork bbq sandwich, a side of beans, and one fountain drink. 

The way you order food is the same for here and to-go, kind of like Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert (which, I'll just tell you right now, is FAR AND AWAY 100x better than this place overall). They even have the troughs of sodas and beers to choose from-I'm fairly certain the bottled Coke is of the Mexican variety, though as you'll learn in a moment, I did not opt for the bottled soda. If you're debating between bottle and fountain soda, GET THE BOTTLE!!!!!!!! I can. not. stress. this. enough.

Why, you may ask, is it so vitally important that one not order a fountain soda? Well, my friends, Rudy's sadly does not filter their water. The ice cubes were revolting, which was my first clue-as I popped one in my mouth I was immediately repulsed, but for some reason I decided to chance it with the soda (which, duh, is made with the same non-filtered water + syrup). BAD IDEA. Grossest soda everrr. And I love fountain sodas! From places that actually filter their water, that is. I wish Phoenix water was better, maybe I'm just spoiled from my time in NYC where I could drink tap water with no weird taste, but BF agreed that the water was definitely funky. Sadly, this problem affects other aspects of the food, causing anything that was steamed by the water to have a weird taste (at least I'm guessing that's why). What's interesting is their sweet tea (which is unbelievably sweet, and is much more palatable when mixed with the unsweetened, conveniently located directly next to it) is delish. I'm chalking that up to the water being boiled first in order to make the tea. 

On to the food...my "moist brisket" was moist, as promised, but was comprised mostly of fat. I know I've had brisket that is both moist and not fatty before so maybe it was just a one-off. The potato didn't taste like a baked potato, probably because it's roasted and not baked, but it wasn't at all crispy skinned like I was hoping. I'll take the blame for that one. The pulled pork was moist and juicy and the sandwich bread was perfect for it. The beans, not so great-too runny and had a flavor I wasn't a fan of (can't put my finger on it, which I realize is not that helpful). 

The stew was the highlight by far-it's a pork stew with what I believe was green chilis and potatoes, and had a really unique and tasty flavor that had both me and the BF craving more. I recommend pairing it with corn chips! 

The prices were definitely great-we got out of there for under $20 for a ton of stuff! We also snagged some of the to-go sauces so we can experiment with the tangy bbq on other foods at home. The staff were friendly and definitely do a LOT of work-when you place your order at the counter, the cashier is the one who puts all of your food together, including assembling sandwiches! I would come back to try some of the other menu items, but if it's brisket I'm craving I'm heading to Joe's next time."}

My mom and I got takeout (so we could eat at our hotel- we're bad tourists), and when our food came out, the bartender carried our food out (!!). I've never had anyone offert that in Seattle. Maybe if more restaurants offered to carry out super large orders like that, I would love them more (or I'm just eating @ the wrong places). I didn't know it was a chain. Pretty predictable in terms of what you get- beans, rice, cheese, sour cream- but it still tasted better than Seattle Mexican."}

He said it is real BBQ and being from Ireland, this was something I had yet to really experience it turns out. 

As I approached the counter the guy behind asked if I had been there before, When I said I hadn't he proceeded to get me some samples of their yummified meats and holy crap did it provide a problem. It was all frickin delicious! I eventually decided to get some turkey, sausage and brisket ( I was very hungry and just out of the gym). 

I like the way they put the food in an old country store style plastic basket (the kind fruit and veg gets delivered to small shops in), and you pay by weight!

I got my stuff pretty fast and sat down at one of their "feeding benches":). I grabbed some greaseproof paper to eat on and proceeded to stuff my face with the finest smoked meats i have ever eaten! The brisket was unreal, Turkey was better than anything I've ever had but the real winner here was the humble sausage! Whatever spices they use only compliments the obvious high quality meat used, a fact emphasised by the way the sausage is cut and presented, sliced lengthways in half so nothing nasty can hide! 

All of this was accompanied by the fittingly unreal BBQ sauce which comes in regular and sissy sauce! Both are equally good and I'll be taking a bottle back to good ole Eire with me! 

After I finished I dumped my trash and washed my hand at the huge trough on the wall. No fuss or bs here, order, enjoy, clean up and leave!

The whole experience left me wanting more and excited at the prospect of my next two weeks getting in here as much as possible! I really enjoy the simplicity of the whole thing: smoked meats which are as close to a butchers counter as you can get, pay by weight, complimentary slices of bread with spicy chop w/sauuuuuse, and eating with my hands ( optional, they do provide plastic cutlery)! 


Note, not for anyone who is looking for a fancy sit down meal or doesn't like real honest food! 

I've been here a number of times since and I have tried most of the stuff on the menu and never been disappointed. Also everyone behind the counter seems to be the same level of very friendly, no bad experiences here!

5 stars only because there isn't anymore!!"}

I  had pork ribs and cole slaw, husband got brisket moist. And sausages and my son got the same. He also got bread pudding which he loved.

This place has some of the best bbq I have ever come across. The brisket and ribs were especially good. The ribs were so tender you didn't need teeth because they just melted in your mouth. We also had pulled pork, corn cobs, sausages, coleslaw and potato salad. All of those additional items were excellent but I still felt the ribs and brisket stood out. There are a couple of reasons this place won't get my fifth star; the noise level and the order process. If you've never eaten at this place before it can be a little confusing on how to order and where to get in line. Not to mention I dislike being rushed and in order for you to see the menu you have to get in line and getting in line is something people do when they are ready to order. I just thought it was a weird set up..Back to the noise level, I like to enjoy conversation with my food and when I don't enjoy the atmosphere I'm in I don't enjoy the food as much. The restaurant is set up with long picnic tables and you just sit anywhere. The tables are right next to the ordering line and the ice machines, etc,. So there is a lot of noise an activity right where you're eating. In conclusion the food is delicious, the price is right and the atmosphere is...acceptable. So, belly up to the trough!!"}

The sides are awesome as well..........and the best part is you can eat with your hands!  They provide rolls of butcher paper and we love to toss the food on the table and go to town!

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. I think they spent more time decorating the place like it was a Greek Orgy room than focusing in on either the food or the service. 

I ordered enchiladas that came out gloppy and tasteless. My companion ordered vegetable fajitas where the grilled vegetables were either soggy, burned, or quite possibly both. Despite it being a quiet time there (3pm), the server appeared rarely as they seemed to be overreliant on their new table touch screens rather than actually paying attention to their customers.

Quoting another reviewer, this place is very "cold and corporate" Considering the plethora or choices in Mexican places in Chandler, I'd suggest almost anywhere else, including taco stands that charge 1/4 as much."}

The server did bring us some guacamole for our trouble and she was very pleasant, but that didn't make up for the slow kitchen.   We finally got our food and one of our guests had fish tacos and the flour tortillas were literally stuck to the plate and couldn't even be scraped off with a fork or knife.   Apparently they'd been sitting in the window for 20 minutes attaching themselves to the plate under heat lamps.   

The server was very apologetic and brought us some fresh fish tacos and even took off 30% of our bill for all the time we had to wait, but I can't give four stars to a Mexican joint that can't pop off a dinner for a table in over 30 minutes.  It's Mexican food.  Just scoop the meat into the shell and ladle on some sauce and send it out!"}

Having moved here roughly 8 years ago from Texas, my wife and I have been at a loss for "real" bbq until Rudy's opened up last week.  It's just as one should expect; brisket is lean and flavorful enough to stand on it's own without the use of sauce.  Thankfully, Rudy's "sause" is just an added bonus.  Be sure to choose carefully as Rudy's offers both moist and lean brisket.  The moist will be a bit fattier but no less wonderful.  Service was excellent and prompt for a wait that went out the door.  The fact that there was a group from Houston to our left and Austin to our right at the counter only confirmed what real bbq lovers already know about this wonderful establishment.

From start to finish we had a great dinner. This may not be a five star restaurant for everyone but for me this hits the spot and tonight the service and food were both top notch.

Our waitress Amy was wonderful and very engaging. She made sure that we had everything that we needed and was wonderful throughout. One of the food runners, Ryan definitely deservers a call out for his outstanding customer service. I hope that the managers of Abuelo's check these reviews because Ryan is really a great guy and he deservers recognition. He always remembers my fiancé and I and he always makes good conversation. He makes sure that we have everything we need and it is people like Ryan who make us want to continue coming back to Abuelo's again and again.

Every once in awhile the service is not as good and every once in awhile there is a mix up with the food but it has always been corrected and I understand that sometimes these things happen. But most times Abuelo's is great and keeps us coming back for more. The chips and salsa are wonderful, the selection of multiple prices of appetizers is great (I recommend the green chili cheese crisp) and the enchiladas are also very tasty.

Overall assessment is that this location of Abuelo's keeps us coming back again and again and that is the true test of a great restaurant, chain or not."}

I'm still digesting from a week ago...I swear!  This food is so good, that you canNOT stop eating. Your mind says "stop..." but your mouth just keeps devouring.

I was in Texas for a few months a couple of years ago, and fell in love with the bbq there.  When we went to Rudy's it was like I was back in Houston.  The meats are AMAZING.  The brisket (moist) is well, moist.  The spicy meat is SO undernamed.  It is delectable.  The pulled pork is awesome, the sausage...wow.  

They use a dry rub method...no sauce.  Sauces are available on the tables, but the meat is scrumptious without any sauce!  We ordered several and shared.  When you come for the first time, they will let you taste each meat...so you know what to order!

Then there are the sides.  Awesome creamed corn, the beans are just perfect.  The potatoes and plain bread didn't thrill me, but no one is perfect.

You eat on paper, which is easy to clean up...and you can either wash your hands in the trough or ....lick them off!  It's acceptable here!  Ya'll come in now, ya here?"}

The dipping sauce for the chimis was sweet and tangy, a pleasant surprise. The jalapeño cheese bites were not spicy, and were closer to hush puppy consistency than I expected.

We ordered an enchilada sampler and shared it. It included 4 enchiladas (spinach, cheese, avocado, and a meat), a chile relleno, beans, mashed potatoes, and a dollop of guacamole. The meat and spinach were my favorites, but the other two were also good. The beans were thick and hard. Next time, I'll get the rice.

Although it was good, and definitely enough to share, I think I'll stick to their seafood. On another visit, I had the Tilapia Vera Cruz, which was delicious and unique.

Most meals are a bit high (about $18 - $24). The seafood is worth it though. 

The décor is pretty. It reminds me of the casual opulence of the Paris casino in Vegas.

By the way, CostCo members can buy $100 worth of gift cards for Abuelo's for $79.99. The server didn't have any problems accepting it.

My friend asked if they could make her a bean & cheese chimichanga which is not on the menu, and we figured easy enough to do, but I guess not because our server said it couldn't be done. She got a meat chimi that she wasn't to excited about. 

I ordered my usual that I used to get a few years ago the ground beef enchiladas. The flavor was okay, but not at all what I remembered. The papas were a fave of mine, but today they were bland. The refried beans were so dry. I hardly ate any of my meal it was so disappointing.

I got a taco and enchilada combo, the taco shell was a generic hard shell like those found at Taco Bell, the chicken inside ( I Kid you not) was the exact same chicken used at Taco Delmar  and the meaty enchilada sauce well, it must have been by  Hormel.

You order by the pound, you help yourself to the cold sides before you order, and your beer selection is made as you wait for your turn at the order counter.  

Visiting the Chandler area with friends, we decided to go here for dinner on recommendation of the locals we are staying with.  We all had the moist brisket.  It was delicious and mouth watering.  We sampled the sides of creamed corn, cole slaw, potato salad and green chili.  All were outstanding.  The seating is family style and you bus your own table.  All in the south tradition.  The decor is rustic and very fun.  The staff was friendly, helpful and quite entertaining!

If you want good BBQ and you are in Chandler, why not stop in and get your brisket on! 

Solid four stars for this establishment.  

Now some folks are upset about the plastic utensils, the self serve attitude, but that is all part of the fun of Rudy's.  You won't find any snooty waiters or table service here."}

We had brisket (my favorite), pork, sausage, and turkey. Sides of Cole slaw and creamed corn for us, along with cheap white bread and pickles. Such a tasty meal. The brisket is so Moist and smoky. And I Love the Rudy's sause!! So perfect with these smoked meats.

Order at the counter, meats by the pound, sides by the pint, free white bread. Bottled beers iced down in coolers as you approach the counter.

No...but holy cow, is it darn close. The brisket was awesomely tender and moist while the pulled pork was also full of smokey flavor. I wish I had the chance to try the ribs, but my friend and I could only eat so much. We also split a pint of the green chili stew...now THAT was a memorable winner. Super good...I even converted my half of the pulled pork sandwich into a sloppy joe-esque sandwich by piling the stew inside. That was heaven on earth especially after a 13 hour roadtrip!

The original sauce is more spicy and the sissy sauce is more sweet. Stick with the original. Rudy's also has this cool trough like storage of their bottled sodas. Grab a bucket and some ice and stick your drinks right in - pretty novel idea."}

I've tried a few different dishes & my favorites are the Durango burrito, Chicken enchiladas, & the Spinach enchiladas. The papas con chile & rice are delicious sides which I opt to get every time (instead of the beans).

They have lunch prices for these items which are very affordable & the portions are pretty large too. The dinner prices are only a little bit higher with slightly larger portions, still worth the cost.

If you're really hungry (or going to share a dish), then the fajita options are great because they're really big & super tasty too! Their margaritas are strong and make for the perfect start to the meal. The salsas they offer with the chips are different than they typical ones. There's a light green one that tastes sweet to start off with but definitely has a kick to it. They also have a regular mild salsa & a hotter one.

I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the service is kind of off sometimes. We've gone during lunch time and they've tried to seat us in a corner table when there are much better tables open and it's not even busy. I'll always ask them to seat us in the middle section up-front now, which is sometimes received with a snarky comment but other times, no comment. I've been opting to get things to-go more often now for this reason."}

So I decided to try it. Walking in, I was very impressed with the decor - looked like the Cheesecake Factory - or maybe a casino. Sat at the bar and started with a margarita. It was ok. Tasted a little watered down. I had 2 of them - which usually does the trick for me - these must have been really light on tequila because I did not feel the alcohol. They brought chips and 3 salsas. The salsas tasted out of the can - and chips were out of a bag- not much taste. I had a combo with enchilada, tamale, taco, rice and beams. The taco beef tasted like Taco Bell but it did have nice lettuce and tomato - the shell was crisp. Tamale tasted like out of a can although it was sitting on a husk. Avocado enchilada was smothered in a white cheese- the advocado was out of a can - smooth texture with no flavor. The rice and beans were tasty.  I kept waiting for something to kick in after I finished my 2nd drink - it felt like I had 3/4 of a real drink since they were so watered down. My bill was $31. - after tip I walked out spending $36 for a below average meal. Abuelos probably stays in business from sun lakes residents and people in from out of town that think this is the authentic southwest Mexican food.  Go down to Rositas on Dobson/Guadalupe - not much on decor - but the food, chips/salsa, and drinks blow this place away.  Mexican food should have some flavor - Abuelo's is overall very bland."}

As I looked at my receipt, I saw that she charged me for the Potatoes, but she didn't give them to me.  I looked and saw this particular cashier serving a family of 5 people.

Abuelos is one of those chains, that if you didn't specifically tell me I probably wouldn't know it was a chain. They serve a little bit higher end Mexican food... kind of like if Garcia's had a wealthier older brother. The decor is really nice and inviting... complete with the vaulted and painted ceilings, which I'm always a sucker for (I know, I'm easy to please). 

The food isn't an A+... it's more like a solid B, but it's a consistent B. There are a couple of dishes that I get on a regular basis. One is the steak & enchiladas, and the other is called "Mis Abuelos Manjar". The steak here is suprisingly good for a Mexican place... actually it's one of the more reliable places to go get a good and affordable cut of meat. Mis Abuelos Manjar is basically a couple of enchiladas which are smothered in sauce then topped with two eggs; pretty tasty. Also, I gotta throw a shot out to the roasted salsa they serve; you have to specifically ask for it; it's served warm and it's oh so good. 

I've never left Abuelos and thought I'd had the best meal of my life, but every time I go, I leave full and glad I made the choice to go there. 

As a sidenote, if you go to this Chandler location, ask for Theresa... she's a fun waitress. 

3.5/5."}

The BBQ is amazing. I've mostly had the moist brisket, but that's my bbq preference. It's served a la carte, they slice the meat right in front of you, and the line moves faster than you would expect. This is my favorite bbq place in the valley. You gotta check it out if you love bbq. It's very pure.

There are some downsides, and the only reason I didn't give them a five star review. They serve the food in a large plastic beat up crate. Maybe I'm just not getting it. Your food is simply on a piece of white butchers paper. I wasn't sure what to do with all that paper. Unfortunately they don't have plates. Without plates, it's hard enough for a gown adult. It's even harder when I bring my kids here. They do ask to go back there, so that's a good sign. It's cafeteria style that is a bit confusing and disorganized. Seems like every time I get to the table I've forgotten something. The side dishes are very bbq themed, but to a fault. I personally didn't like any of the side dishes they had. I tried the baked potato and butter side dish. It was essentially potatoes in a broth made entirely of butter. Seriously I'm not joking. You don't get that much butter when you go out for lobster. They have a peach cobbler, which is refrigerated. I don't know what's up with bbq and peach cobblers, but they do it here too.

Again, this is my favorite place for bbq. I just see some opportunity for improvement."}

Scanned the restaurant; picnic tables, clean and open. OK., awesome I can bring my toddler and not worry about her ruining other peoples' meals.
Greeted right away by a lady at the "country store". She asked us if have been before which we hadn't, I replied that we needed help (I have a20mo and a 4mo infant in a carrier). She came over to show us the menu, the line to place our orders and let us know that the cashier can give us samples of the meats. Fan-frickin-tabulous.


We figured out our order then went to the counter. ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE. 
Miss boring-as-all-get-out brunette. She didn't even look at us. HELLooooo.
She wasn't even up at the register, but back about a foot. I asked if they had a kid's menu, she mumbled something incoherent. What??? So 2 registers down was a young man so we passed on miss head in the clouds. As we head to the other register the cashier left. ARGGGGGG! Back to the brunette.
I start the order..... turkey sandwich and brisket sandwich..... to which she yells back and a man starts carving. Sandwiches were brought FAST. Then we ordered potato salad (get it yourself from the fridge), corn and new potatoes. She turns and gets the corn and potatoes, meanwhile my sandwiches are getting cold. COLD.
She tap-types on her register and then says our total. Excuse me, can I order drinks????? Her bubbly reply (add sarcasm) "oh yeah".

We grab napkins and a table, apply the bbq sauce and dig in..... to ice COLD meat sandwiches.

Quick back track to the menu...
NO KID's MENU?
No mac and cheese?
No fries?
No cornbread?
No green beans?
No salad?


The good
Turkey was moist and had a good flavor, would have been excellent if warm.
Husband said brisket was really really good, but cold.

The bad
-Sause sucks, worse sauce I ever tasted. Like water and pepper. They have 2 sauces and both taste the same. One has a ton of pepper, the other has more.
-Potato salad, really is potato salad so difficult?
-Corn was soggy and had no flavor.
-Red potatoes (called NEW POTATOES here) are water logged gross.


The ugly
-Napkins on the other side of the restaurant in a dispenser on the wall (bathroom 3-fold paper towel dispenser).
-STYROFOAM- THE DEVIL OF THE PLANET.


One star for the country store greeting gal.
One star for the turkey.

I'll be back for the turkey and a soda, skip the sides and bring my own sauce."}

I heard this place was pretty popular in Texas so thought I would give it a try. I wasn't too hungry and they let you order 1/2 pounds of meat which was great. When I walked in, it had a very Texas vibe with benches for seating and self serve condiments/water/etc. They also had a plethora of bottled sodas that you can purchase for $1.99 each. 

I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket and 1/2 lb of baby back ribs. The brisket was delicious. It was my first time eating it, but it was very well cooked and the meat was so tender that it melts in your mouth. I'm used to meat being really well marinated, so I felt like the meat was pretty bland. There was bbq sauce on the tables that people used for the meat and it was really good. It gave the meat a perfect spicy kick that wasn't too crazy. The baby back ribs weren't too good. I could say that I've had way better. The meat didn't come off the bones like some of the baby back ribs that I've had. The meat wasn't too tender and was pretty chewy. I also thought it lacked some flavor. 

I would say the brisket is the definite thing to get here. It was very reasonably priced and super delicious."}

Now that they are in Phoenix I am doomed because I will never actually try to smoke brisket at home because I can get it here and it is just as good.

Here is the good and bad with Rudy's. I keep buying the good and stay away from the bad. :)

Good:
- Moist Brisket. for those who don't know brisket has two parts, the flat and the point. The flat is lean and the point is more fatty(moist). guess what has more flavor? Yep the moist. 
- Turkey. Sweet mother of sea biscuits!!! Best smoked turkey I have ever had.
- Smoked potato with moist brisket. They cook the potato in the smoker and then add cheese, your choice of meat(moist brisket is the right answer), sour cream, and butter. (This isn't healthy food so don't eat here every day. Remember moderation is key )

Bad:
- The sides... I haven't really found a side that I like. The beans are ok, as is the cream corn and the potato salad. I really could use some Mac and Cheese. 
- The sauce... They love the pepper and it shows in their sauce. I have had much better sauces but they will do if you really need them. Hint: Good BBQ shouldn't need sauce. 

Now in Texas the Rudy's have Dr. Pepper in glass bottles... This Rudy's would have gotten the 5th star if they had that too. 

Either way try the turkey and the brisket with some white bread and go home happy and full. (Full because you remembered to get the potato stuffed with Brisket right?? Good)"}

Meat is sold by the pound. Brisket, turkey, chicken, sausage, beans etc. you do have a choice of getting the meat sandwiches too. On the way to order, there's a fridge of some grab and go items too.

We got both the regular & jalapeño sausage, half a pound of turkey, half a pound of lean brisket (that was my mistake...go for the moist!!!), some beans, coleslaw, and banana pudding.

When you order, they put all your items in the crate like carton. No fuss, no muss.

To the right of the order counter, they have the condiment, utensils, & napkins setup as well as fountain drink setup plus, of course, sweet tea and unsweetened tea.

Once you get your food & drinks, pick a table and dig in! On the table there are different sauces like the sissy sauce and the original sauce. Both were good but I found the flavor of the BBQ sauce to be a little different from what I'm used to. Did it stop me fr eating it? Nope!

All the food had great flavor. Nothing was bad or mediocre. I especially enjoyed the jalapeño sausage. Would do that again. Back to the brisket....I don't like chunks of fat. I just don't. And being a first time here, I figured the safe bet was to go lean. Naturally, it wasn't as juicy and moist as I'd hope for but it didn't lack in flavor at all. I saw other folks "moist" brisket and I'll definitely do that next time!!

Rudy's is a favorite around here. So keep in mind it does and will get crowded depending on when you come!"}

The BBQ meats are all fantastic as well, my favorites were the lean brisket, the pulled pork, and the baby back ribs. Was surprised to find the lean brisket to be more flavorful than the moist brisket. Great smoke ring. 
Very friendly staff, fun environment that isn't too smokey. Appreciated that I didn't spend the rest of the day smelling like smoke. Some people might like that though.

So I figured...instead of getting the sandwich...I can just make my own with the bread they gave me.   Liked how they weighed all the meat before you.  1/2lb of brisket didn't seem like a lot in my basket...but seemed liked what everybody was getting in around me.

Many would call me a BBQ fanatic. In the last decade my friends and I have been to more than 500 BBQ restaurants in the US. To be honest, it's probably more. We come to Rudy's often because we always know what we are going to get: friendly service, great BBQ and enough food to feed the family without spending too much money. Rudy's is good for consistency. Every piece of meat is cooked well. At this great Phoenix area location I've never been disappointed. 

While many in Arizona might not be aware Rudy's is a chain one that dominates the Texas landscape and continues to grow because it's good. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are stars here. In fact, their breakfast tacos are not only super affordable, but also come in huge portions and out duel most breakfast tacos you'll find anywhere else. 

There's much to like about Rudy's. This, like all the locations, is roomy, and packed with good BBQ options. Meanwhile, there are no combos. Everyone orders meat by the pound (or a sandwich) and have an abundance of choices, none of which disappoint. 

The Meats: 

Turkey: Hands down: some of the best, mouthwatering, tender and moist turkey in America. And, it tastes like this every time. 

Briskets: It can be ordered lean or moist. Moist is for those who don't mind the fatty stuff (which is where the flavor stems from). Lean comes mostly without fat and a a bit drier. Each tends to hit the spot. 

Chicken: To be honest, we often overlook the chicken, simply because the turkey is so darn good. However, if there's a few of us and we want to sample several meats we'll get a half-bird, something no one has ever complained about. 

Sausage: Take a pick: regular or jalapeno. Different tastes. Nevertheless, each impressive.  

Pulled Pork: It's a challenge to order the pulled pork when the rest of the meats are so darn good. Still, it's above average and tends to be less dry than at many BBQ chains. It suffers like the pork loin - not because it isn't good, but since there's so much competition. 

Ribs: The pork spare ribs and baby back ribs tend to be complete with fall off the bone and tender meat. Keep in mind, you don't have to buy a half or full rack. You can order by the bone. 

Spicy Chop: This is a smorgasbord of Rudy's meats chopped up and marinated in spices - and it's one of our favorites. So much flavor. So tasty. A must. 

The Sides/Dessert
 
If you don't mind a lil kick order the green chili stew. Mmm! Be forewarned, it's spicy, but seeing fresh green chilis in the soup proves they make it on site and adds more flavor than you can imagine. The rest of the sides are fine, too. That includes the potato salad, creamed corn and cole slaw. 

On the other hand, normally we stick with the meats and save room for one of the desserts (the banana pudding, chocolate pudding and cobbler are tops (they change seasonally). The desserts aren't made in house (the rice krispy treats are, however, we're told), but do impress and could fool you, because they taste good enough to believe they were made in house. 

When in the mood for BBQ Rudy's is a home run regardless of time of day. You'll find wonderful meat, won't have to spend too much money and can enjoy eating in a comfortable atmosphere. And, in Phoenix, it's tough to find better sweet tea."}

Great BBQ at a gas station?!?!?!   Sign me up!!  I can multi-task.  Well, the location in Chandler doesn't have a gas station, which is fine with me.  I love the employees here.  They put up with all kinds of nonsense from oblivious customers and are always friendly and upbeat.  

What it does have is some delicious smoked meat.  And very cold beers.  I think there are some sides, but I can't remember them because we go full-on carnivore when we eat there.  

I swung in today during my least favorite time of day, the noon hour, but I was in the area, so I thought I'd get some brisket and sausage to go with some delicious smoked gouda I have at home.

The line was almost to the door, which is to be expected, but then I realized that near the front was a group of almost a dozen people, all together, clogging up the works.  

My version of this morning's meeting:

"Where should we have lunch?"

11 voices chime in "RUDY'S!!!!"  1 voice squeaks out, "Whataburger."

"OK.  Rudy's it is.  Should we have them cater?"

"NO!!!"

"Should we call ahead?"  

"NO!!!"

"Should we look at the menu ahead of time and figure out our orders so only one or two people are at the register?"

"HELL NO!!"

"Should we all go up to the register together, order separately, take all the time in the world, and clog the works up for everybody else?"

"YES!!!  Screw those assholes!"

I think some of that jagoffery I experienced in Nebraska followed me home.

There was some evidence of jagoffery in the parking lot too with a gray pickup and small trailer for a solar panel business taking up FOUR spots during the lunch hour.  Could have done with two.  Nope.  I'm taking four.  

Jagoff."}

So, I don't have crazy expectations or am a fan of this kind versus some other kind. 

The way Rudy's works is that you stand in line, wind around the drinks, turn on the refrigerated goods (potato salad, three bean salad) and end up at the registers where they weigh out the different foods. 

The jalapeño sausage is amazing. It's probably my favorite offering. And the rest of the meat is pretty good too. We usually get the sausage and some brisket. 

You then take your food, hit up the condiment bar where there are peppers and onions and the like, and find a seat on one of the picnic benches. They keep their bbq sauce on the table and I usually don't even touch it. The meat is too good to ruin with sauce. 

Make sure to clean up your area when you're done and they do have some ziploc bags up at the condiment area if you manage to preserve any leftovers."}

I used to eat at Rudy's when I lived in Albuquerque. My favorite meal was smoked turkey and the butter drenched potatoes and it is here in Chandler too. The turkey is tender and a bit smoky, potatoes are perfect and very buttery. My only complaint is the turkey was excessively salty! So much so that I thought it was just a bad night and we went back the very next day. Yep, the very next day.

Let's talk about the atmosphere first. You park in the parking lot and take a deep breath of smoking meat goodness. You walk in and typically get welcomed by someone in the gift shop/country store. Then go stand in line around troughs of drinks, soda and beers, pass by a big fridge full of desserts in small containers. They have many cash registers so the long line will go fast, order off the board, all the typical meats, sides,  AND GREEN CHILE STEW! Get the stew or you will be sad, it is like straight from NM. The real deal. They take your order people in line behind the registers are cutting, slicing, chopping your meat fresh and weighing it out. If you order potatoes they may ask with butter? Um, hell ya. Drown 'em. Do you want sliced white bread? Not me but maybe you do. Pay and stop at the bar for peppers, sauces, napkins, utensils and paper to put down on your table. 

Go find a big picnic table to sit on, spread out your paper and dig in. Two sauces on the table, regular with a little bite, and one with a big bite. We tried it all the second visit and enjoyed everything but the turkey was still very, very salty.

I loved the green chile stew and will be back for that but given the choice between Famous Dave's and Rudy's - I would probably choose Dave's. Maybe it's the atmosphere as Rudy's is a bit of work, plastic utensils, no plates and no price break."}

This is the kind of place that makes me think, "Thank God I'm not a vegetarian!"
The smoked meats are terrific, namely the Brisket (moist) and the Turkey (who knew BBQ could be guiltless?! And SO delicious--only about 200 calories for a half pound), which is so juicy and flavorful it doesn't need sauce.
My husband and I did Take-Out so we didn't have to deal with the lines and that went very smoothly...so friendly and helpful was the counter girl that he asked if he could tip her--she said "not allowed" (which was cool).
We tried a little bit of everything on the side: potato salad was egg/vinegar style (no bacon or onions) and we both enjoyed it. The cream corn was rich and tasty but a bit too sweet for me (wasn't expecting that; almost thought it could be a dessert). The BEST side we tried was the Green Chile Stew which had a kick but not too much. Very nice!
For dessert I was just going to taste the Peach Cobbler (I gobbled it all up!) and the banana pudding (with Nilla Wafers and whipped cream, nice but could've used some real banana chunks). 
I'm from Jersey so my opinion on Texas BBQ carries very little (if any) weight but I can say that the smoked meats are wonderful and they allow you to put your own sauce on ("Original" or "Sissy") which I like because sometimes I don't want ANY sauce.
I am already planning my next visit! Yay!"}

He also explained it to her so she would know to watch for it in the future.

Therefore we were near to Abuelo's for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP.

We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear.

Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service!

Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!"}

We had Pulled pork sandwiches - A+ Excellent, cooked to perfection and full of flavor

New Potatoes smothered in butter - Absolutely amazing (just like i remembered) probably going to lead to a heart attack

Coleslaw - Not sure, but the fiance said it was amazing

Creamed corn - very tasty and sweet

We each had a beer from the large selection on hand.

Overall it was a great dinner and only $30

The BBQ is great and I prefer the brisket, pulled pork, or jalapeño sausage. The sides and bottles soda/beer are tasty, too. 

Do yourself a favor and grab a bottle of Shiner Bock, 1/2 lb of brisket, some white bread, and a handful of napkins, and go to town with the Rudy's original (little spicy) BBQ sauce. You will be in a heavenly food coma in no time."}

Guy at the counter was a dumbo. I would guess the first thing they teach you is to offer the customer bread and sauce on a to-go order? Well after that issue got settled, all I bought was some turkey. Still solid and since I don't mind a dryer version of the bird, it was enjoyable. But Texas BBQ House gets the edge for their unique spices. Rudy's just pretty much smokes the bird, but doesn't jazz it up. Both ways are good, it just depends on what your in the mood for. 
      They don't do this anymore (at least here), but Rudy's used to be know for a really friendly greeting and they always would offer you a sample of whatever meat you wanted, but you didn't have to ask, it was just offered. Back in Texas where I first encountered this chain, that was the norm, but in Chandler, it's business as usual."}

Not just like, but savor it, love it! That alone earned them four stars. The fifth star is because of their PHENOMENALLY friendly service. From before I even walked in they were helpful in holding the door for me (Tip: once you walk in, walk straight to the back of the store to order if you are dining in). They gave me the full run down of the place and how to order. 
I had a half dozen free samples, and eventually ordered the spicy chopped beef sandwich, .5lb of burnt ends (lean brisket with the INCREDIBLY good crispy bits on the end. Not on the menu, but they took care of me), a medium Dr. Pepper, and a side of Rudy's beans. They use Holsum brand bread and offer unlimited white or wheat bread. The total was $17 and change.
The sandwich was the best BBQ sandwich I've ever had. It's hard to explain in writing how incredible it was. First, there was a lot of it. Second, it set off every flavor receptor in my mouth without overwhelming them. By that I mean it wasn't too spicy, and I believe it's flavored so anyone could enjoy it no matter what their taste preferences. It needed no toppings or sauces.
I started out this review talking about the brisket for a reason. Incredible as the spicy chopped pork sandwich was, the lean burnt ends were better. They tore apart perfectly, had almost zero fat, and the fat they did have HELPED rather than hurt the meat by adding an extra punch of flavor without being greasy or chunky. They were moist enough to not need sauce though they did offer two types which I didn't try. I didn't want to spoil the perfection.
The beans I didn't like. I tried two bites, then threw them out. I was expecting something more like Bush's baked beans.
The bean issue aside, my experience here was incredible and I will most certainly be back."}

Abuelo's became one of my favorites in the short time that I lived in Chandler. We had the opportunity to stop in for dinner on our last night on our way to the airport, and I was very happy for the opportunity. Abuelo's is ALWAYS on the list. 

Stopping in on a Friday night and expecting that to work with a tight schedule might have been a mistake since the couple in front of us was told that it would be an approximately 45-minute wait. I immediately walked over to the bar and found two chairs where we promptly ordered. Our bartender/waitress was awesome and had drinks and food out in no time.

The sandwich was ok nothing to have lingering memories of as it was sloppy but tasted ok. The potato salad was above board and very good. The soda fountain had a good tasting supply of treated water. The diet coke tasted like it should during my visit.

The line was long, but moved quickly - a great sign of good things to come.  I had the brisket sandwich (moist), potato salad and banana pudding while hubby opted for a pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw.  The brisket was out of this world, and my husband was very envious as his pork was "just okay".  Neither of us were fond of the potato salad or coleslaw, so that was a bit of a bummer.  I really wish they had baked beans or mac and cheese, but next time I'll try the new potatoes.  The banana pudding though, was divine.  It could rival my grandmother's homemade banana pudding, but we won't tell her that.  I have been thinking about it all day and am even considering stopping on my way home to grab some.  Haha!

Yes it's picnic tables, and no it's not very fancy.  But c'mon folks, it's BBQ, not Ruth's Chris.

We kinda splurged cause we haven't eaten out for a while, the bill was just over $70 which is more then we normally spend but the food was so good we both agreed it was worth it.

It was pretty busy, but the line moved fast. Different type of ordering & service with the pick and choose drinks, cold sides, then up to the counter where they give you the hot sides and slice the meat. Prices were fairly standard for BBQ dinner. Brisket was a little too fatty for me and did not like the BBQ sauces. Meat did have a good flavor and was very tender. Beans were very good - would like to see a wider selection of sides including okra. I've had better BBQ brisket and would rate this as only average."}

The building, decor and dining experience is excellent. The service has always been superb and friendly. The salsa is good and I enjoy the enchiladas.

We started with the Guacamole dip.  That was fantastic and I would even go back just for that.  However, I did save room for the luncheon special with a single cheese and onion enchilada, beans and "papas".  

I thought I was full.  However, others at the table "had" to order and share a hot "Chocolate Eruption"  which consisted of a chocolate bundt cake and ice cream.   There was no way I wanted any .... until I saw it.  It's probably the best dessert I have ever tasted.

I tried to give this restaurant a 4* rating but couldn't think of anything that knocked it down from a 5* so that's what it really deserves.

The bf kept telling me not to expect too much so expectations were low, but we ordered a half pound of moist brisket and a half pound of turkey to share. We also got some complimentary wheat and white bread slices. They also have a station where you can fill up on onions, jalapeños, cherry peppers, pickles, etc. I always like to have a contrasting crunchy vegetable when I'm eating meat so it's nice that I'm not forced to order a side. Although I will admit I wish I had ordered the creamed corn since our friends did and it was DELICIOUS. I felt no guilt getting two helpings of this from them. (I'm a sucker for corn). 

They have a few different sauces at the tables which include BBQ sauce and hot sauce. I looooved the combo of a piece of brisket dipped in BBQ sauce/hot sauce, piece of bread, pickled veggies, and a bite of creamed corn. I was glad we didn't order too much since I definitely would not have stopped eating. 

At the time we went it wasn't too packed and if you've never been there before (just me) they tell you how ordering works. You get your order in a big plastic bin lined with parchment paper. At the station with the veggies you can also pick up napkins and rip off parchment paper to cover your table with. Overall would recommend if you're in the mood for BBQ in this area!"}

I came here for lunch today, and had a really good time.

Pulling in, I decided to do lunch instead of dinner because I figured it would be a lighter crowd, and to some degree it was. I mean, it wasn't packed, thank goodness, but people were coming in like crazy!  Quite impressive at the heavy flow of traffic for a Saturday lunch hour.

I came in and asked the girl at the front how it works here.  She went through how I stand in line, and place my order at the counter and they make the food while I order.  There's also a HUGE selection of cold beer as you walk through line that's on ice, along with a great selection of cold side items to go with whatever you eat.

I took my time ordering at the register, and felt really comfortable taking my time.  No rush or pressure to "hurry up" and I had a lot of questions about their menu.  They had 3 different types of brisket, and I asked what the difference was between all three.  The girl told me that one was lean, one was not, and I forget what the third one was.  You can go with a half pounder type meal, or a smaller sandwich which is what I had wanted.  I went with the Moist Brisket, creamed corn, and a medium drink.  Total bill was just 9 and change.

I got my food and went to take a seat. Everything here is picnic table style, so your going to end up sitting next to strangers, which I'm fine with.  They have BBQ sauce, hot sauce and one or two other items at each end of the picnic tables. If your stuck in the middle, I don't know how you would get the BBQ sauce if its clear at the other end.  The Brisket itself was AWESOME! Most, tender and definitely awesome! I totally loved how it tasted, and everything was just right.

They also have a HUGE hand washing station for when your done eating.  Why do I love this?  First, BBQ is messy! You get your hands kinda gross from the sauce and who wants to go into the bathroom just to wash your hands? They have 4 or 5 different nozzles and the water is nice and warm..soap and towels to! right there out in the open!  I love it.

Here's why I deducted a star. It's going to sound SO DUMB but I think you'll get it. First, there wasn't really any BBQ sauce on the sandwich itself. That's fine because the meat tasted perfect without it.   Normally, at other BBQ places, there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce. Rudy's only had 2.  Regular and spicy.  Okay, I'll take that. 

Here's the catch. The sauce is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the container! They have this weird nozzle on the sauce container and you must use both hands to get it out...including pounding on the bottom of the bottle and turning it 100% bottoms up!  I know what your thinking...the bottle must be empty, right? NO ITS 100% FULL.  I got so irritated with it, that I just stopped putting sauce on! I want more sauce! Why does it have to be a major project?   Eveyrtime I tried to sauce my sandwich, it became a huge bottle beating project!  Basically, they need better nozzles that let more sauce out so I don't have to break the dam thing to put it on my sandwich! argh!!!!!

Overall, I would 100% recommend this place! GO EAT HERE.  Definitely worth the drive!  They even have a little store in the front where you can buy stuff like BBQ sauce and other stuff for your home too!"}

The brisket was great though. Really moist with a lot of flavor. They had two sauces to choose from, both of which were alright. We also got a side of potato salad which was pretty good too.

They have nice moist brisket where you can actually see and taste the smoke ring. To me, you judge a good BBQ place by their brisket and this place holds it's own. If brisket is not smoked long enough it just tastes like crappy pot roast. That is unfortunately the case with most places in the valley. The only other place I can recommend around here is Texas BBQ House in Phoenix although once Rudy's moved in, even though Rudy's is a chain I have to say they are still slightly better. The Green Chile Stew is really great tasting. As is the turkey and Jalapeno sausage. Overall, if you are looking for good BBQ in the valley this is the best you are going to find."}

We had hear about Abuelos since we first moved to Chandler 2 years ago. In that time we have visited several times and each time has surpassed our expectations. Start with food as usual, we have tried several dishes and appetizers. Our favorites are the carnitas enchiladas and the firecracker shrimp tacos.  The servings are plentiful, the ingredients fresh and the flavors delicious. Overall the food is very good.  Next in importance to us is service. We have been there at the busiest times, Like Friday nights and during slower times like weekday afternoons.  Every time the service has been excellent very little wait and lots of attention.  The restaurant itself is spacious, open and very nicely decorated.  All in all, we have always enjoyed our visits to Abuelos and will continue to go there.  We must also say that none of this was a surprise to us once we learned who the proprietor was.  We both knew Chris when he was very young and starting in the food business. The food business has always been Chris, passion and that continues to be evident in his establishments."}

We ordered our drinks and meals and all was delivered timely and in perfect quantities. My husband and I had the steak and chicken fajitas. Others in our party had the chicken enchiladas with varied sauces. They stated that the "cream sauce with jalapeños was out of this world!"

I haven't been here in a few years and decided it would be a great place to celebrate my birthday. 
The cons: my son has a couple of food allergies but a grilled piece of chicken is a standard and reasonable item he usually has when we go out. I requested that and alerted my waiter to his food allergies. A manager came by and I was told that most of their meat comes pre-marinated and they didn't have the ingredient lists to be able to tell me what was in any of the marinades. Nor could they tell me what the ingredients were in items like the tortillas and was told that was because the day guys unpacked them all and threw out the boxes that listed all the ingredients. I get food allergies are a pain, so I wasn't concerned too much about what their allergy friendly foods were, it just sounded shady that they had no ingredient lists for any items I asked for. That should be a pretty standard thing they have in their office. They offered a bowl of fruit for him, of which he was fine with. Our waiter was also missing in action for long stretches of time. Despite turning 29 that day, I'm actually more like 80 and ate dinner at 5 and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. We waited a good 15 minutes between being seated before we received any drinks and barely saw him. 

The pro: Despite their weird pre made items with mysterious ingredients, the food was great. I actually quite enjoyed it. However, I probably won't be returning here. It was just a really weird experience."}

On to Rudy's which is pretty much next door, and we made a fantastic choice.  I had the Moist Brisket and my Partner had the Turkey Sandwhich. They both were awesome. Paired with the Rudy Beans and a Peach Cobbler that was great. I wish they had Ice Cream for the Cobbler.  While we were there a family of five sat next to us and had a BBQ picnic style meal. The setting is cool with the table layouts. If you enjoy beer (never been one to tip it back) you will enjoy the large beer troff they have. I am a firm believer that the BBQ sauce makes or breaks a place and this was nothing short of Fantastic. They have a spicy and a "Sissy" flavor, both very enjoyable. We were offered samples and I had a very difficult time choosing since they were all very good tasting."}

I ordered (and still do) the kid's bean/cheese burrito - very inexpensive and yummy.  The thing I like is that the beans have a peppery taste to them so it's not bland.  
The one thing that keeps me coming back is the chips and salsa.   It's not unusual for me and my lunch buddies to go through 2 bowls of chips and 2 bowls of salsa EACH before we even give our order to the waiter/waitress. I think they put something in it to make you crave it.  
For the price and atmosphere - I can only comment on my kids menu choice ($6) and the lunch crowd (not too busy)."}

After living in Texas for many years and then being able to travel back for some of the great barbecue Texas is known for, we love to sample Texas BBQ restaurants located elsewhere.  

We noticed two fairly new barbecue restaurants across the street from each other on Chandler Blvd.  Now what's that all about?  Who would build a restaurant next to a competitor?  Well, evidently  Rudy's BBQ  and Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ did.  I wonder who was first??

It was an eeny, meeny, miny, moe picking which one to go to.  We ended up going to Rudy's.  I read the reviews.  I know lots of folks love Rudy's.  After our first trip there, I've got to say that we couldn't understand why. However, the brisket was very good and tender so it really does deserve the three stars but I've had better.   If I were just comparing Rudy's to the other barbecue restaurants we have eaten at, it would be at the bottom of the list.  

The rating is for the restaurant and the experience as a whole which drags it down to a two star.  Everything you order is ala carte.  If you order meat, you get only meat.  We didn't like the barbecue sauce and we didn't care for the spicy beans.  I was raised on pinto beans and cornbread.  I didn't expect spicy beans.  I wish we had tried the cream corn but only read about it when I got ready to write this review.

One more thing I didn't care about was the way the food was served.  It was served in a crate like tray with an edge all around.  Eating it was awkward but it kept the table clean.  Actually, that was a good thing because there are several signs around the restaurant telling you that your mother doesn't work there so pick up after yourself.  Now I know we all do that at fast food restaurants but at a barbecue place?

Nope.  We won't be going back.  Next time we're in the area we'll go across the street and try out the Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ restaurant.  I did walk through it and it definitely looks a "cut" above Rudy's .... but the review has to wait for the taste test.

In the meantime if we're in the mood for good barbecue we'll probably make a trip over to Gilbert for the fabulous Joe's BBQ or even a stop at Famous Dave's."}

Cons
-Extremely large and very bright inside. We felt like we were eating in the "Cheesecake Factory" of Mexican restaurants. 
-The decor is reminiscent of Ceaser's Palace in Vegas.  Very grand and somewhat over the top. 
-We ordered skinny margaritas.  They arrived quickly and were not skinny and we could tell they use a jigger to measure the tequila. We could not drink these as they were too sugary.  We ordered a second round and voiced our disappointment to the waiter.  The second round was the same as the first minus the limes. 
-I ordered the two chicken enchilada combination. One with green sauce and one with red sauce. I asked the waiter if the sauces were the same that came with the chips and salsas.  He said yes and I indicated which red and green salas I preferred. He said no problem. My dinner arrived shortly and unfortunately, both were covered in red sauce. The red sauce was nothing like the salas.  

Overall, the place is very mainstream and geared towards the masses.  We won't be back."}

We were excited to try a new BBQ joint closer to our house since we normally go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert..  Now listen fellow yelpers, you have never steered me wrong.  So I was convinced this was going to be good, after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place.  I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at all.

We arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked.  You grab a bottled beer or soda (or they have cups where you order for fountain drinks) and then order at the counter.  No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket, given the good reviews I had read on here.  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into, as there are no trays or plates!).  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread. I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough.  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much.  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables, like on a cruise ship!  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles.  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream.  It was not tasty at all.  The beans were not bad.  But the moist brisket....it was moist alright - it was oozing fat!  I think 50% of the meat was fat.  I was somewhat disgusted.  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either.  Luckily, he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side. Cannot go wrong there!!  Pretty sad when the best part of your meal is a bag of Lay's BBQ potato chips.  

I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all"."}

The boyfriend and I hit up Rudy's on a Sunday afternoon around 2:00pm. We were a little surprised to find the parking lot packed and when we walked in there was a long line. At 2:00pm! I'd hate to see the line at the lunch or dinner rush. I've heard the line is often out the door. 

Anyway, we got in line and began to look over our menu choices. We decided on the brisket and the pulled pork. They had a few sides but nothing I was that impressed with. No french fries and no mac n' cheese. But they did have peach cobbler so I got that.

They sell their meat by the pound. Since we were getting it to go we ordered 1/2 lb of brisket and 1/2 lb of pork. For the brisket they literally open up the smoker, take out a huge slab of meat and cut your slices off and weigh it in front of you. Awesome. Meat-tastic even! We grabbed our bag o' meat, some sauce and headed home. 

The meat was very tender and tasty. The sauce is more of a spicy BBQ sauce than sweet but went well on both the brisket and the pork. I liked the pork best, but boyfriend prefers the brisket so everybody wins I guess. And the cobbler was excellent too. 

I'd like to go back and try their prime rib that they make on Sundays. they also make breakfast tacos. Hmmm. Maybe that's what I'll do tomorrow...."}

If you want some real Texas BBQ, check this place out.  If you are a first timer, they will give you a sample of any of the meats to try before you order.  It is all priced by the half pound, but you can order as much as you want and they will charge you accordingly.  Most of the meats are like $6.49 for 1/2 pound of the most wonderful, tender meats that you can imagine.  They serve bread, which is complimentary, if you want it.  Their sauces are great.  We loved the Sissy Sauce and bought some to bring home.  Even their original sauce was good.  Banana pudding was pretty tasty too, as we got some for our grandson.

Brisket was super moist and tender! I tried it with the two different sauce and actually preferred the meat alone with no sauce. It was melt in your mouth awesome. Jalapeno sausage was okay, not spicy at all though. Creamed corn was good, not Lawry's good, but I'd order it again. I actually sprinkled a little salt and it tasted better. That's just me, I like the sweet & salty combo. Green chile stew was good also. Not spicy but flavorful. Cole slaw was exactly like KFC's, but that's okay with me 'cause I like KFCs slaw. Bread was the generic supermarket white & wheat bread. I had a bite or two.

I called ahead at 3:30 to check best seating times. We arrived just before 5 and were immediately seated. After sitting for a few minutes we noted that it was a very warm in the restaurant. We were brought our drinks in a timely fashion and ordered. It became even more obvious that there was an AC issue at the restaurant and I asked the waiter who stated that they started having AC issues at about Noon. We went ahead and had our meal which I really don't remember eating because we were all suffering from the heat in the restaurant which must have been 100F. Waiter said yeah, sorry... but you should see how hot the kitchen is. Like we really were concerned with the kitchen. By the time we left the restaurant had filled up and we were leaving drenched in sweat.
          I asked to see the manager at the front desk before we left and she promptly came out. I advised her that all of her customers were miserable and why had she not been seen for the whole time we were there (little over an hour). She stated that she was working on getting the AC fixed.         
          I just wanted to share this and let you know that if I do not receive some kind of positive feedback (which I did not receive at the restaurant) from corporate I will never return or recommend your company again. We've been enjoying your restaurant for over 10 years here. That manager should have been on the floor interfacing with the customers and offering discounts or even refunds. And she definitely should have had the matrode/greeter warning customers at the door (if not closing the doors for new diners).

So what really pissed me off was that I well called well before driving the 30 miles to the restaurant and nobody said a word of warning.

And yes, our son dropped $80 on his first time taking me out for a fathers day meal (with his first pay check), and he felt HE had to apologize to me. 

Horrible, horrible, horrible manager.


We typically had very nice meals at Abuelo's.


UPDATE: I was called very quickly by Abuelos today after sending an email and yelping. The restaurant owns their errors in communications and resoution when they had issues yesterday and are trying to make things right with their customers that suffered through the meal yesterday. Though I can't bring myself to go above 3 Stars, I do bump it up to a 3 Star review from a 1 Star review for their rapid response. Thank you for doing the right thing Chris. We will return :-)

Final Update: Chris came through with some credit to dine here again. We returned recently and enjoyed our experience and will probably return in the not too distant future."}

Their chips are also nice and crispy and their salsa has a different roasted flavor to it which is really good. Unfortunately, the husband is not a fan because he says its not very authentic. Authentic or not, its awesome!!! The prices are good, portions huge, and the service had almost always been stellar. The only thing I would advise against though would be getting the taco's. The shells are literally the kind you would buy in a box at the store. Other than that, this place is great!"}

We got hungry but could not find a place to eat since we have a doggy in the car and we could not leave him alone in there. Came across Rudy's along I10 then decided to give it a try. It is not a fast food chain so we pulled in. My hubby ran in to get food while I stayed in the car with Lou. He came back with beef brisket, 2 kinds of sauces, slaw, sweet cherry pepper and 2 coca cola.  We sat in the car and ate our lunch. It was really good! The meat was sold by the pound. I had a sandwich with warm toasted buns. Hubby had just meat since he can not eat bread. The meat was lean, tender, and flavorful! The sauces, original and sissy, were nice compliments. Slaw was home made and yummy. I didnot know Rudy's is also in Chandler, Az. We will surely visit it there once we get back."}

At 11:30, the wait was about 15 minutes, and my gf was already in line at the doorjam of the entrance.  If you get there at 12:30 (when we left), I noticed the line was inside near the breakfast tacos area.  

Next off, I don't have any nostalgia from eating at Rudy's from when I was young (I'm from Chicago).  I also recently ate at the Texas BBQ house up in Scottsdale which makes me feel like I'm a bit of a Texas BBQ expert.  Imagine if you watched a bunch of travel documentaries about London.  Two weeks later, you travel to London and get off the plane.  That's how I feel when I walked into Rudy's.

We ordered brisket (moist), turkey, cream of corn, and new potatoes.  The brisket was awesome.  Very moist compared to other BBQ I've had.    The turkey was also not dry at all, and it was well flavored.  Cream of corn was excellent and not too sweet.  The new potatoes were quartered boiled potatoes with butter drenched on them (yes delicious).  You get some bread with your meal and everything comes on wax paper which is supposed to be shiny side up.  I like their condiments area with the different peppers.  Their sweet tea was also great, and I especially liked how it wasn't as cloyingly sweet as I've had at other places.

The only downfall is that I wish their sauces tasted better.  They have their bbq and their sissy.  It's probably a personal preference, but I like a sauce with some major kick to it.  I mixed in the hot sauce into the Rudy's sauce which made it taste better.  I also think the brisket needed some sauce to it.  Even though it was moist, it lacked on salt.

Those reasons aside, I found the food to be the best Texas BBQ I've had.  Long lines may be there, but it moves pretty quickly and gives you time to figure out what you want.  I'll definitely be back here when I have another BBQ kick."}

The brisket was salty and the coleslaw, pickles, and creamed corn blah. However, the big sin was the prime rib. First it was presented so raw that the server commented that it wasn't properly cooked. I agreed, expecting that she would get another serving. Nope! Thowing barbeque or any prime rib on the grill to heat or worse cook it more destroys both texture and flavor. So, my advice, go elsewhere. Making that easy in this case is having a barbeque place next door. To be honest, I'd probably also prefer the Dennys on the other side."}

K and I met here on our first date. Boy has it changed. We come here about 4 times a year. Why? Because we end up with a coupon which in the end doesn't really make it worth the visit.  I want to like this place and I used to like it a lot. But aside from being "average at best" for Mexican food, there's just more to not like than there is to like. 
Our server tonight seemed out of place. Like he was moonlighting from The Keg across the street. He was good. Then he was bad. Then he was good. Yikes. My head hurts. O.K., we got refills on our drinks without having to ask for them which was nice and just before we were leaving he brought me a to-go drink. But at the end of our meals he took forever to bring to-go boxes, spilled lemonade on my foot and took a plate away without asking if we were done with it.
C wanted a steak burrito with cheese, that's all. Our server recommended something that had ground beef in it. I told him no, he wanted grilled steak. Not ground or shredded beef. He suggested the Fajita Chimichanga with steak. So that's what C ordered, with the Chile con Queso, sour cream and guacamole on the side. $14.79. He also got beans and rice which he didn't want. He also didn't want the Anaheim Pepper that was inside the Chimi. When we inquired if the kitchen could make the Chimi without the pepper we were told that the kitchen doesn't "make" the Chimi's, the just heat them up. The Chimi's are already made so the pepper couldn't be removed. SERIOUSLY!!!. For $14.79 they are serving pre-made Chimichangas. I can get a made to order burrito at Chipotle for half that. I couldn't believe it. Is the age of actual human cooks working in a restaurant a thing of the past? Is it just conveyor belts, microwaves and monkey's back there? I'm appalled.
C's grandma ordered the Monterey. Sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchero enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and quacamole. $17.59. She made a few requests, like putting the guacamole on the side and everything was done to her satisfaction.
K ordered the Grande. Three enchiladas - one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken. A cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and quacamole. $17.59. The crispy beef taco was a crispy shredded chicken taco. Plus K ordered the pinto beans but go refried beans. Not only can't the kitchen make a chimi, they can't read a ticket either. 
I ordered the Classic Chicken Fajitas. $13.99. The Fajita skillet was warm, but definitely NOT sizzling as it is described on the menu. The plate comes with sliced grilled chicken, onions, red and green peppers. There were still seeds on the red pepper. So they can't make a Chimi OR prep a bell pepper. Wow. I also got 3 nice sized flour tortillas and a side plate full of condiments like pico de Gallo, shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lime wedge, rice and crappy lettuce with a couple of radish discs. There was a good amount of chicken, but it was a bit dry and not very flavorful. I think Chili's across the street does better Chicken Fajitas.
The busser kept the chips and salsas coming which was nice. They now serve the salsa's in a cute little 3 compartment dish. We went through 4 refills of the salsa's.
Although we didn't use it. Abuelo's has the Ziosk. Neat little machine that sits on the table allowing you to order drinks, dessert and/or play a limited amount of games. It also lets you sign up for their email club. I've signed up twice but have never gotten any email from them with a membership number or coupon. K signed up this time so we'll see if anything shows up. Something to note though. The games cost $1.99 which is a dollar more than over at Chili's. 
Server off his game, prices to high, pre-made food. 1 Star."}

We lucked out!  There were only about ten people in front of us, so we felt we scored!  

I am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in true TX form).  

Last night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.

With three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.

THE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.  

The turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the "black edges" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.

The coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.  

We were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!

DESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.  

The banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy's?!  

Overall, we will definitely get Rudy's again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.  We can make the sides for a lot less and I am sure DD would prefer something other than the turkey for dinner.  

Yes, that's right, will be back."}

Right when we pulled up and parked you could smell the smoke.  We parked right in front of where they load the wood into their smokers.  It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, they pull it out of the smoker and cut it fresh for you and weigh it right in front of you on a scale.  They then place it on butcher paper and into a milk carton type tray.  I couldn't wait to try it!  We were in for some grub!  There was no line either (probably due to Easter) at almost noon which was a score!


One of my coworkers used to work at a Rudys in Texas many years ago and he recommended I get a few things....  Pork ribs, creamed corn and a loaded baked potato with meat.  We got that and a whole bunch more too ;-).  We got 1/4 pound lean brisket, 1/4 pound smoked turkey, 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, a half chicken, a loaded baked potato with brisket on top, some creamed corn and some drinks. They also give you slices of white/wheat bread for free so you can make sandwiches out of your meat.  Total came out to $35.00.

Here is how the food stacked up..................

Pork Ribs- These things were fantastic.  They had a fantastic bark on them.  Almost looked burnt but they weren't.  They tasted great and had a strong pepper/smoke flavor to them.  I liked them a lot and my friend wasn't lying when he recommended them.  They were awesome!

Baby Back Ribs-  These were great too.  Not as blackened as the pork ribs but still seasoned well.  The meat came off the bone with just a little tug.  Damn they were good!

Smoked Turkey-  Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of smoke flavor but was still pretty moist and not dried out.  My best friend is a turkey lover (he ordered turkey every chance he could on our KC/Memphis trip a few years back).  He would have loved this stuff.  It was great!

Lean Brisket-  I'm usually not a big brisket fan but this stuff was legit.  You could see the straight up smoke ring around the edge of the meat.  It was tender and delicious.  I don't know if I have ever had better brisket.  I would definitely get it again.

Loaded Baked Potato-  They give you a softball sized baked potato and top it with a ton of butter, cheese, sour cream (we skipped the sour cream) and your choice of meat.  We got brisket on it and unlike the slices of brisket they give you when you order brisket on its own, this stuff was almost like burnt ends chunked brisket.  Tasted great!

Half Chicken-  This is the only thing we didn't really like.  We picked at it a bit and it had a great smoked flavor but we were so full from everything else that we tossed most of it.  Wouldn't get it again.

Creamed Corn-  This was just ok.  I like corn but usually when its corn on the cob.  Plain corn I will eat but I'm not the biggest fan.  This corn tasted like frozen corn you can buy and then they creamed it up.  Its almost like a gravy of sorts.  I probably would not get it again.  We tossed most of it.

Coke products in the fountain drinks.  They had a grip of bottled drinks/beer in huge metal tubs of ice too.  It was cool to see.  My wife got a root beer in a bottle and liked it.

Service was friendly.  They did forget to give me my potato at first but then when we brought it to their attention they got on top of it right away and brought it out to our table.  Total of $35.00 for the giant crate of food we got was well worth it IMO.  

This was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long long time.  It reminded me of me and my buddies trip to KC and Memphis a few years back.  The smoked meats are delicious and I would come back often if I lived out here.  Don't even ask me how their BBQ sauce tasted.......I didn't try it.  The meat was so damn good it didn't need any.  That's a winner folks!  Legit Texas BBQ at its finest!"}

You eat at long tables with everyone else, so be nice and be respectful. Maybe strike up a conversation with the people sitting next to you. It won't hurt, I promise.

I also greatly enjoyed finding some coleslaw that didn't taste like fingernail polish. (I'm looking at you almost every store bought coleslaw ever).

Even though the decor is horribly kitsch, I loved the feeling of being at a family BBQ. Could really use some paper or plastic plates though. For the price, quality and quantity I think it's a "smokin" deal."}

We had the moist brisket, baby back ribs, and jalepeno sausage, along with small beans, cream corn, potato salad, baked potato, and finally a little cobbler.  Standouts were the cream corn, baked potato, and cobbler.  We'd give the ribs 4 of 5, but the brisket, sausage, beans, and potato salad were just okay.  Brisket tasted of artificial smoke that was over powering.  The jalepeno sausage was good but no jalepeno flavor and no spice.  The beans and potato salad were just blah.  Neat environment and friendly service.  Try Joe's in Gilbert or Allison's in Mesa...they are both sooooooooo much better than Rudy's."}

It was almost like a fast food kind of restaurant. You walk up to the counter to order and the seating is all bench styled open seating. Not super ideal but kind of open and friendly at the same time.

I'm not super big on spicy things and it turns out that even the least spicy thing there was, ultimately, too spicy for me... including the baked beans. But it was still pretty tasty. There was no real option to get any kind of veggie unless you wanted some okra or something random like that.

There was a frenzy of five star reviews when this place first opened written by Texan ex-pats (yes, TX is its own country). Even though I grew up in AZ, I did live in Houston for 7 years... now that's a real restaurant town!  My favorite bbq there was Papa's and Good Co. and we also went frequently to County Line since there was one close to our house. But I also really enjoyed trying mom and pop joints on our weekend road trips thru Hill Country. There are a ton of places on a back country road you can only find by following the scent from the smoker that were meat markets that gradually evolved into eateries. The butchers used to smoke the older or less desirable cuts of meat to keep them from going bad and then serve them up by the pound with the sausage and all the other meats. Customers wanted to buy some of the smoked meat to eat right there so they set up some picnic tables outside the shop. Maybe there was an ice house on the property where they kept the meat that they could store some cold beer in. Originally you just got the meat on butcher paper with some sliced white bread and then they started making side dishes. That's Texas barbecue for you. Rudy's is not a butcher shop/ice house that gradually transformed into a bbq pit.  Its a chain restaurant. Not that there is anything wrong with that. But why can't I get plates? And a real table with a comfortable chair?? And someone to refill my drink? This place is not steeped in history, its only 6 months old. I watched them build it. So what is all this stuff on the walls? Just kitschy junk. I totally understand the Texans around town being excited about a piece of home here in Phx but I feel like this place is just sort of a sad imitation of real Texas BBQ place.

Enough about the place itself, you either love it or hate it. As for the food, I liked the taste of the brisket. First time we went there were no visible smoke rings but subsequent visits the meat was much better. I love all the sauces but I wish they had a dry-rub on the meat for when you don't feel like sauce. The smoked turkey had much more seasoning to it. The ribs taste great, but where are the beef ribs? How can you call yourself Texas BBQ if you DON'T HAVE BEEF RIBS!?!? I don't really care for potato salad or coleslaw so the only sides I tried were the new potatoes and corn (boring) and also the beans which were good but in my opinion Texas beans should be much, much spicier. I was extremely disappointed by the fact that they don't have cornbread since in my opinion that is another staple of Texas style BBQ... but maybe that's just east TX?

I do love the fact that they have a huge beer selection (including everything made by Shiner Brewery!) and that it is served ice-cold and at a reasonable price. But I do not like the fact that if I want another one I have to go wait in line again.  Boo to that. I am sure we will be back since it is so close to our house and despite the lack of plates, the quality of the food is WAY better than the place next door. I hope that I see Rudy's continue to improve."}

I give this place 5 stars.....

I know it's a chain but I think the food is tasty...the ambience is really very nice too. Relatively speaking its cheap too. I think their chips and salsa are pretty good. I usually judge Mexican restaurants based on their chili rellenos they have two kinds one filled with cheese and the other shredded beef...both are delicious. 

They have the standard rice and beans that most Mexican restaurants serve with everything...but they have an option called "papas con chili" ...imagine a cheesy mashed potato casserole...I don't think Mexican when I request it with the rice because I'm not a big fan of beans....but I still think it tastes good.

I recommend this place if your looking for a good bite! I've probably been here a total of 15 times or so...and have never had a poor experience."}

My boyfriend and myself decided to give Abuelo's a try today. He got a gift card from his work so we figured might as well give it a shot. I'll be honest, I wasn't excited because I've been craving pizza all day (being 7 months pregnant all I crave is pizza), so I wasn't all excited. It's the day before Christmas Eve and it was packed. Right when we walked in a hostess greeted us, and sat us at a nice little table. We were given nice warm chips, and salsa. And our waiter greeted us and got our drinks, first of all. The spicy salsa is wonderful, the green salsa is even better! I opted for a raspberry lemonade and it was so refreshing. We ordered some of the jalapeño cheese fritters and when I say they are amazing, oh I mean it. Right after we took the last bite of the cheese fritters our food was brought out. I was amazed because of how busy it was I figured it would be another 10 minutes till we got our food. The food was soul warming. We ordered off of the lunch menu and I got a chili relleno stuffed with cheese and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice and it was so flavorful. My boyfriend got the chicken chimichanga with beans and their papas con chile, he's usually a bit picky with his food. But he cleaned that whole plate off. We agreed we will definitely be back, but only for a special occasion because it is a bit pricey."}

Oh, how I've missed you!

It was so great to see you today. Your baby back ribs tasted as good as I remembered. I don't know how you are able to smoke them AND still manage to keep them so moist! I don't even put sauce on them; they're delicious on their own. 

I also had your tasty lean brisket that had a nice bark to them. I even tried your pork ribs for the first time. While they were more meaty than the baby backs, they were not as moist or flavorful. 

To add some veggies into the mix, I had some of your coleslaw and corn on the cob, both of which seemed really plain. It's okay though, cause we all know nobody comes here for the sides--unless they're the outvoted vegetarian in a group of bbq lovers!

For dessert, I got your regular praline and chewy praline. The regular one pretty much tasted like brown sugar with pecans. The chewy one however, was divine; the caramel version of pecan pie. 

Thank you for a great lunch today. I don't know when I'll see you again, but I will think of you often. 

Bbq Wishes,
J"}

I thought I died and went to heaven when I saw that they were opening one in Chandler. Since it opened only a few weeks ago, I have visited twice but my husband is there almost daily. It is that good. This is a BBQ joint. Most Rudy's in Texas are attached to a gas station - this one is not. So this isn't a fancy restaurant - but who wants that for BBQ. You order at the counter, get your food served on butcher paper and get as many slices of white or wheat bread as you desire. The brisket melts in your mouth, get the cutters choice. Moist, delicious, heaven. You can order by the slice or pound increaments - such as 1/4lb etc. The pulled pork and ribs are also amazing. The sides could be a meal by themselves - the creamed corn - SCRUMPTOUS! Cole slaw - fabulous and potato salad - AWESOME. The only side I am not a big fan of are the beans - just don't personally like ranch beans. There are also puddings available for desert but i am always too full to try them. 
Since anyone who has ever visited the great state of Texas is now lining up to get their BBQ fix there is a line, but it moves fast and is absolutely worth the wait."}

This was a staple back in Round Rock, TX and it's something we've missed since living in AZ.  I could hardly believe my eyes!

So it's not got the charm of a convenience store/gas station like the ones I'm used to, and okay, there's no giant Rudy's "Sause" dispenser, but I very quickly got over that.

The long cooler had plenty ice cold Shiner Bock, so that scored some points right off the bat.  Service was super friendly, even if a bit slow (quality takes time, I had to remind myself), and though most of the same quality exists, there's just one thing keeping me from giving 5 stars: chewy brisket.  The flavor is there but it's just missing on texture.  Turkey and sausage were right on.

The food is bloody amazing. As a Brit in America it really is nice to be shown how BBQ is really done. The moist brisket is ridiculously nice but it is also brilliant that you get the lean option on the menu. I can come here if my friends go and don't feel bad for eating the lean brisket.

My problem when I come here is that I don't have a big enough stomach for all the things I want to eat. The potato salad is gorgeous and the hot sausage is my absolute favourite. I feel that if I ate here more often that I would have some serious health issues as when I leave my stomach is like a beach ball and I come out around 15 lbs heavier than when I went in. This is certainly not a complaint... more of a testament to my complete lack of self control.

This place is always recommended... but for me just when I am extremely hungry."}

My husband had the brisket tacos and he said it was the best he has EVER eaten!!!! He is very picky and hard to please so that says A LOT! My family eats here one to two times a week! It's that GOOD!! Please open a location near Paradise Valley!!! This is a great place for kids because they have game kiosks on the tables. My daughter loves playing on it! Try the cheese and onion enchilada with queso on top,,, it's so good!! Spike and Alonzo the bartenders are the best servers and bartenders!!! The chimichangas are the best! You must try their side of potatoes they taste like twice baked potatoes, delicious!!!"}

You start off your journey by picking up a beer.  I recommend the Shiner Bock IPA or original Shiner Bock.  You can choose assortment of meats and sides.  If it is your first time or if you want to sample something, they will give plenty to try out.  I highly recommend their jalapeno sausage and pork loins.  When you are done, you can ask for bread and make a little sandwich with whatever items you picked out.  Lastly, you have an area where you can pick up your condiments and sauces.  The BBQ sauce here is awesome!"}

The food is served by 1/2 lb and includes choices such as brisket, moist brisket, pulled pork, sausage, etc. I chose the brisket with burnt ends and was not very pleased with what I received. I'm hoping it's because I arrived an hour prior to closing that I was so dissatisfied, but the brisket definitely lacked flavor. On a brighter note, the cream corn is SO DELICIOUS! I wish I would've ordered more of that! And Rudy's beans were just eh.
The girl who attended us didn't seem happy to be there and had a bit of an attitude. Always a huge negative for me. Overall, this is not a place I would go out of my way to come back to."}

The Bar B Q sauce had a nice kick to it while the Sissy sauce seemed more rich and full bodied. Overall it was a great experience!

Pretty much everything on the menu has cream or cheese as an integral part of the dish. Even the tortillas are warmed on skillets covered in butter. So, if you are like me, I would skip this place.

However, if you are like the majority of the population who enjoy dairy products spread all over your food, you will love this place! It's not really Mexican food as much as it is Tex-Mex. Lot's of enchiladas and tacos and burritos. The portions are HUGE...you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck! Everyone at our table (we were a table of 20) was very happy with their meals....The chips and salsa were really good too!! (I usually judge a restaurant such as this by their chips and salsa...) I ended up having a salad with cheese and whatnot removed, and salsa for dressing, as most of the dressings also had dairy in them......

Service was SUPERB! As I mentioned, we had 20 people at our table.....we were seated in less than ten minutes, our water and chips were never dry......and we only had one waiter!! He did SO well! He knew the menu very well too, and was able to help me find something I could eat. 

So, 4 stars for service and everyone being happy, and one star docked for there not being more allergen friendly dishes......"}

Abuelo's also doesn't make good Mexican food.

If you're looking for toned down versions of Mexican fare with the occasional winner, then their menu may delight you. But it's also for the most part very forgettable. You'll walk away feeling satiated and maybe even like you got your money's worth, but there's no afterglow of delicious Mexican goodness.

The glitz, the glam, and the consistently good service can't make up for the fact most of the food is just bland as hell. As someone else mentioned, it's not lack of quality ingredients; the produce is fresh, the cuts of meat are decent, and it's cooked well. There's just no flavor, much less any spice. Guy likened it to an upscale Del Taco--that's unfair to Del Taco; they at least have the balls to serve food with taste.

What's more disappointing is they weren't nearly as bad several years ago when they opened. There was still better Mexican in the Valley, but I could leave Abuelo's without feeling like I ordered a Bland Platter."}

Food was average :
- chips and salsa : best part of the meal... the green pineapple salsa dip was amazing! Would love a jar of this at home.
- enchilada combo #2 : shredded beef topped with queso and green chili cause... eh OK. The tortillas that they were wrapped in was somewhat rubbery. 
- margarita pie : tad too sweet and doesn't taste much different from a standard key lime. 

Decent Mexican place for (business) groups as there is something for everyone... but nothing out of the ordinary."}

I really wish that I could provide a higher rating for this joint, as we had many suggestions to try it, as we are new in town since a few months ago.  It was my wife, myself, adult child, and our two elementary school aged kids.  I had brisket sandwich - Extremely dry and bland.  Wife had turkey sandwich - Extremely dry and bland.  The girls had pulled pork sandwiches - good, but nothing special.  My son had corn on cob and a samling of our sides.  Corn had been sitting in hot water (so I am not even going to commment on that).  Sides were good, but average (beans & potato salad).  Good selection of peppers, pickles, sauces, onions and foutain & bottled soda.  Overall it was VERY average to a bit below average, and I think it would take someone alot of time to convince me to try it again.  Joint is clean, well stocked and staff was Extremely friendly which was kind of what saved two stars."}

Just tried their breakfast tacos... basically a burrito they just fold them nstead of role them up.  I have eaten them two days in a row and and have tried all of the pre made tacos.. jalapeño sausage was the best so was the spicy chop.  All in all they are great.  The premade all have a Meat, eggs and cheese for 1.95 each.  One is enough two will fill you good luck with three."}

Being a bbq connoisseur myself (claims the fiance), I was so thrilled to see a bbq joint come up right next to the 10.  

My fiance and I went Rudy's the second day they were open.  The line was out the door and I thought to myself "This place has got to be amazing with a line like this!!".  The line went pretty fast so it wasn't too bad.  I think it took us less than 30 mins to get up to the registers.  They sell meat by the 1/2 pounds and they weight all the meat right there in front of you.  They also give you your choice of wheat or white bread.  We only asked for 4 slices but we saw a guy in front of us ask for a whole loaf and they literally handed him a brand new loaf to take to his table!  They serve all your food on wax paper and put everything in a crate for you to carry to your table.  This, I was not too thrilled about cause I felt weird eating off my table with just some wax paper between my food and my table. 

So on to the food.....

My fiance and I ordered a half pound of babyback ribs (which are my favorite) and a half pound of their moist brisket (which is his favorite).  We also tried their cream corn, green chile stew, and their banana pudding for dessert.  I gotta say that I was highly disappointed with their ribs.  Maybe I'm not use to "TEXAS" style ribs, who knows?  As I was eating the ribs, I was telling my fiance that I know I'm eating a rib but its weird cause I feel like I'm eating a rotisserie chicken.  It didn't have much of a bbq taste to it at all. We both didn't finish it, it was just too weird eating ribs that taste like chicken.  With that being said, the brisket was AMAZING to say the least!  Nice and moist, perfectly cooked.  Probably the best in town!  Their cream corn is really good as well and that's coming from someone who doesn't like cream corn.  The green chile stew was to die for.  My fiance loved it so much he inhaled the whole thing before I knew it!  The banana pudding is just as good as everything else.

We did enjoy the food for the most part enough to come back a second time.  We pretty much ordered the same thing except I decided to try the half chicken instead of the ribs and come to realization that they use the same rub on their chicken as their ribs.  Which explains why I thought I was crazy thinking the ribs taste like chicken from my first experience!!  The chicken was nonetheless really good cause well, IT TASTED LIKE CHICKEN!! 

Overall, the place has the best brisket.  I had to give take away 1 star for the ribs.  Ribs are my favorite and if you can't do that right I don't know what else to tell ya!  The other star is for the whole eating on wax paper.  Rudy's is lucky my fiance is a man and doesn't care if he eats off dirt, but me, i prefer a plate thank you very much!  So if you're looking for the best brisket in town, Rudy's your joint, but if you're coming for some awesome ribs, I wouldn't suggest it.  I'll stick to Joe's Real BBQ for my ribs."}

Fajitas for 2 is the usual order. The steak was tender and flavorful. The chicken can be a bit dry. I like the bbq shrimp minus the bbq sauce as I think it has an off taste. 

It was a great decision to bring back endless guac refills for the fajitas.  But, don't be a jerk and abuse that offer!

For me. The fajitas are the best. I'm not all that into Tex Mex otherwise. And, make no mistake, Abuelo's is straight up Tex Mex. Don't come here if you are expecting a different style cuisine like Sonoran or Baja California or Oaxaca. 

Nice Yelp offer, too.

Don't know what happened to my review of this location a couple years back. Still very happy. 

Good quantity. Fair pricing. Friendly staff. Clean."}

The Pork spare ribs are a current fav....
I always skip the bread and grab a pile of pickled veggies instead. Their original sause is very good...I've never tried the sissy sause, must be sweet or lacking pepper I suspect. Anyway, expect to spend about $15-$20 and feel stuffed.

I have dined in twice at this location because it's very close to where I live and I have high hopes. The price is not commensurate to a restaurant where, you stand in line to order your food, get served in plastic baskets with butcher paper, eat with plasticware and when all done, clean up after yourself.

Yes I have been to original places where that is how it's done and I don't mind at all. As long as the food is outstanding and not mediocre. This Rudy's franchise location has mediocre food at best.

If you want to taste REAL BBQ try Little Miss BBQ on University. Mind you if you don't get there early enough they may be sold out. And you might have to wait quite awhile in line but for the same money or less in most cases you will be rewarded with OUTSTANDING BBQ. And you will never to be able to be a enjoy a place like Rudy's again."}

Because I travel a lot, I 've been to Rudy's throughout Texas and New Mexico, so going to the new location in Chandler certainly saves me a lot of driving if I develop a hankering for Rudy's.

Now having said the above let me tell you a couple of things I like about the Chandler location.  

First, and I've already mentioned, it's in Chandler so now I don't have to go to Texas or New Mexico.  

Next, they have onions and pickles for free.  Now that may not seem like much, but the Rudy's in San Antonio (3 locations) and the one by Texas Motor Speedway don't give them away...they cost extra.  Again, doesn't seem like a big deal, but I really like pickles and onions with my BBQ, being able to get what I want without having to pay for it is kind of nice.  As an aside the two locations in El Paso and ABQ offer free pickles and onions.  I'm not hung up on this issue, but it speaks to consistency in my book.

So now some things I didn't like or at least have a question about.  

First, every Rudy's I've been to has large stacks of wood to stoke their smokers.  The first time I went to Rudy's (too many people there so I didn't eat) I noticed the wood stack was down to a couple of logs.   So question comes to mine...how are they stoking the smoker?  Or are they?  Are they serving food from a central kitchen?  I don't know, and to be honest, I didn't pay enough attention to how the Chandler location is set up.  Having said that, every other Rudy's I've ever been to you can clearly see the cutters pull the meat out of the smoker.  So bottom line here, not really complaining here, just making an observation which I'll need to do further research on to clear up.

Ok, so on the day I did eat here, the food was good, but frankly food I've had at other Rudy's location was better.  Right now I'm attributing this difference to the fact that this is still a new restaurant so I'm not going to hold it against them.

When we ate there we ordered sausage, brisket, cream corn and potato salad.  So potato salad as always was adequate...not good, not bad...just adequate.  As for the cream corn, this is one of my favorite Rudy's dishes.  Not bad.  Cream wasn't fully set and it was a little bland, but overall still good.  Brisket was ok.  I ordered it moist, but probably should have ordered lean (I make the same mistake every time).  Finally, the sausage...my favorite...and the reason I want those aforementioned pickles and onions.  Not bad but the cutters mixed my order and I got a combination of regular and spicy sausage...I wanted regular.  I attribute this error to this being a new restaurant...so I forgive them for now.

So over all very good.  Will certainly go back"}

That moist brisket... I gotta get it every time. A buddy of mine is hooked on their potato salad, too, and the turkey WHEN IT'S SLICED THINLY... they sometimes cut it thick like a turkey steak, even against his wishes. I don't ever order it, though, cause the "moist with bark" (bark is the blackened good stuff on the ends of the brisket) is all I need.

The plastic silverware and eating off of paper, on long tables, is a minor gripe. The line can be a drag. The sides... well, they're OK, but there's not really a "lite" option, like fresh veggies or anything, you know? Plus, their desserts, while wrapped like they're homemade, are FULL, literally FULL, of ingredients you can't pronounce, which is a drag... These are the things that keep us from coming here more often. But let's be honest, you go to Rudy's for the meat. I think there's a joke in there somewhere...

One more thing.. they have Big Red soda. I never knew this amazing soft drink before Rudy's, and I get it every time, much to the dismay of my stomach, which turns on me if I get a refill!"}

Plus you can grab a drink (pop or beer) and drink while you go through the line. I'm not sure if it's a Chandler thing, but the people in front of us and behind us were nice and chatty too. They helped us choose our meal and explained the process. When you get to the cashier, they give you a full sample platter before you place your order. All of the meats were good! The Briskit was nicely charred, sausage link was juice and pulled pork was melt in your mouth good. The sides like creamed corn and red potatoes were good too! Everyone we were with gave it 2 thumbs up!"}

After reading several reviews about other Mexican restaurants in the area, I decided to take my friends to Abuelos and I'm so glad I did! We started off with the Dip Sampler which was yummy & hot! The chips were endless and the waitress happily accommodated our requests for a spicier salsa. My friends ordered the Avocado enchiladas and the beef enchiladas with a crunchy chicken taco on the side. Both couldn't stop raving about the fresh ingredients and authentic taste. I ordered the Shrimp Yucatan Fajitas. They came out sizzling and were delicious! 

The waitress was so friendly and helpful, the layout of the restaurant was authentic and kind of gave us a feel of the Venetian in Vegas with the high domed ceiling. I will definitely go back to Abuelos!"}

The staff is friendly and nice. The price is a little bit pricey for what you get. You still have to stand in line and serve yourself and I preferred to sit down and be waited on if I'm going to spend $32 for dinner. The sauce is OK but I did have the regular pork ribs once instead of the baby back's and they were undercooked and tough. They need some more time to let those slow cook so that they fall off the bone properly and so that you don't have to tear them with your teeth so hard. The baby backs are excellent and the prime rib is excellent when you can get it. Other than that no problems with the place at all. As I mentioned the staff is friendly and very willing to accommodate you. If you take the food out it's a little bit messy unless they give you a shopping bag because you'll have to visit the condiments bar and and everything has to go in a plastic bag he which doesn't really tote"}

The meat wasn't as tender.  We did use the BBQ sauce for flavoring which helped. The beans were okay.  I think the beans from Little Miss BBQ is on point.  Service was great though.

My favorite is your moist brisket done perfectly with crispy little ends. That and your ribs, smoked turkey, and chicken and I'm in heaven. Don't let me forget to mention that creamy corn you serve up with the meats. That is tummy-tickling goodness. The set-up here is super easy to navigate as you meander back and forth through the line past the bottled beverages - good beers and sodas to choose from. Step up to the counter and order your meats and sides and they hand it all to you in a wooden crate. You and your party may now sit wherever you darn well please - my son and I love to sit on the patio. Best BBQ in the Chandler/Tempe area so far!"}

My & my gf moved here from San Antonio, Texas to attend ASU in Tempe.  We live in Ahuatukee on the I-10 two exits away.  We used to go to Whataburger all the time.  This must be a Texas obsession, because I BARELY see any around.  Anyway!  The minute we saw the sign where it said ,"Coming Soon, Rudy's." WE BOTH FREAKED OUT, & said, "Oh My God, Rudy's is coming here!?  Shut the hell up!"  Then we waited, & waited, & waited some more......  Then one day I see that it is completely built & there are employees walking around the place.  Almost there.  Finally, Grand Opening!  Immediately after getting out of work I go directly to Rudy's to wait in the MASSIVE line snaking around the building.  There must have been more than 100 people in that line easy.  We did not care.  We proudly wore our Rudy's 20th Anniversary shirts that we had from back home.   

Former & current Texas residents imagine this:  I used to live literally across the street from the Rudy's that was serving Sea World on US HWY 151.  Yup, right there.   And I went often.  Sometimes even with my sportbiker crew that I rode around with.  Rudy's is the absolute sh**.  My gf & I always talk about how we miss Rudy's & she even had her parents ship her the bottles of Rudy's Sause.  That's how much we loved that place.  So there we are on opening day waiting about 30 to 45 minutes for pure goodness.  Then we get to the front of the line.   I love how the staff yells.  They did that at in San Antonio, too, but these guys are super loud.   Love that.   We did notice that the sides items (coleslaw, potato salad, etc...) are all prepackaged in styrofoam cups in refrigerators which is nice.  They stay cold in there.  Good idea.  Also, we noticed that there was no pickles on the menu.  Rudy's in San Antonio always charged us for pickles that they sliced & served us.  We were very disappointed at first.  We even asked an employee that happened to be from Laredo, TX & she was not aware of the pickles at all.  She might have never gone to Rudy's is why.   Oh well.

Anyway, we get our food in a bottle crate on wax paper, (THIS IS THE WAY IT HAS BEEN DONE IN TEXAS FOR THE LONGEST TIME SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOUGH!)  All non-Texans just do not get it & they probably never will.  Oh well, their loss if they never go back.  
So we start walking to the condiment bar & lo & behold there were the pickles!  Free of charge.  Yay!  We nearly yelled at the girl for telling us she knew of no pickles.  Pickles is something you don't play with when it comes to Rudy's.  You NEED to have pickles with your Rudy's barbeque, people!  No butts about it.  We have a laugh with the girl & the manager about the misunderstanding.  And by the way, that awesome manager, Marcus is the absolute Bomb dot com.

So at last we sit down on the old country benches to eat.  The moment of truth.  I like to refer to this moment as "P.H.E." PURE HEAVENLY EUPHORIA.  

Just as others have said, the brisket is tender, the chicken is tasty, the sausage... oh my.   Wonderful sausage links marinated in Godly flavoring.  Another difference here:  They not only give you white bread with your meal, but you now have a choice of enriched wheat bread.  Lovely.  

I happen to love the sissy sauce.  I think it's just right for my spicy sensitive 
tongue.

One more difference I took notice of.  I used to order the chopped meat back home.  It used to contain a little bit of everything like chicken, pork, & beef.  All mixed in Rudy's Sause.  Not here.  I asked the employees, & they did not know of this of course.  They said they didn't carry it.   Only the pure chopped beef.  That's okay.  Because I love that all the same, regardless.  

I can say that the best meal here would be a quarter pound of chopped beef, potato salad, coleslaw, wheat bread, & either a Big Red or a Coke.  PHE all the way, baby.  

There's no way Rudy's is getting anything less than five stars.  We missed you Rudy's.  We welcome you back into our lives.

That was only two weeks ago.  We've been back 4 times since then."}

You can buy all your favorite meats here, by weight, and the service is great. 

Get there before 10 AM and they have breakfast tacos ready to grab and go at the counter. The brisket ones are my favorite. 

For a more standard meal, order you meat, grab your side dishes, and head over to their condiment bar after you pay and grab as much bread, sauce and pickles to your stomach's delight.

They've also opened another location just of 10-West near Litchfield.

Great place to grab a quick, yummy meal before or after hitting up a Cactus League baseball game."}

I've probably had better brisket, but am no expert, the turkey sandwich is top notch, buttered buns is a nice touch. A surprisingly good craft beer selection in ice buckets you snake past as you wait in line (Goose Island, San Tan, 4 Peaks etc). Service is bizarrely great-you only deal with employees at the counter, but they're extremely helpful and pleasant. Extra slices of bread, napkins, every condiment you can imagine are on the central table, and love the slop sink outside the bathroom so you can wash up & rinse BBQ sauce off as many times as you want without venturing into the loo. Rudy's BBQ sauce is the kicker, a little more spice than smoke, in my spice-loving opinion a great complement to the food & a nice souvenir to take home (Sissy sauce available for sissies). The typical BBQ cabin atmosphere, even a little more folksy than most BBQ places, but that adds to the no-nonsense charm. Will be back once my appetite recovers from this visit."}

The chips & salsa were mediocre at  best, probably not even that.

The brisket was fairly well cooked but the crust was charred and bitter.

Turkey sample was moist.

The pork samples were very fatty and the pulled pork is very vinegar laden.

Potato salad was decent and standard.

3 bean salad had a vinegar and sugar taste but not much else.

Corn was  typical, over-cooked steam table fare.

The meats were prepared fairly well but the over-powering hickory (I assume) flavor and charred exterior made for a bitter after taste that stayed with me and my wife.

The sides were an after thought as with most places."}

Standouts were the cream corn, baked potato, and cobbler.  We'd give the ribs 4 of 5, but the brisket, sausage, beans, and potato salad were just okay.

This restaurant came highly recommended and my anticipation was high due to the fact it is hard to find good quality BBQ in Phoenix. The service was fast, the dinning room has that down home pleasant feel, and that is where the pleasantries end.

I ordered the smoked pork ribs, baked beans, and coleslaw. The ribs were smoked but boiled before hand. The baked beans turned out to be reasonably seasoned pinto beans. The coleslaw tasted as if they had simply taken the cabbage from the bag and added a generic dressing to the mix. 

The other catch to the whole experience is (BUYER BEWARE), they weight the proteins (brisket, ribs, turkey, etc...). The cost of the meal was overly priced. 

The entire meal lacked the desired flavors my appetite craved...

For those who know BBQ, don't insult your finely tuned tastebuds with this so called representation of smoked BBQ. Just because its has the smoked flavor, doesn't make it BBQ..."}

The main issue at Rudy's is the ordering system. During peak times, this could be a problem if you have time issues. It all depends upon the people in line ahead of you. If they know what they want and have no questions, service is fast. Otherwise delays will take place with the line growing. I recommend off peak hours because of that ordering issue."}

You walk in and if its your first time they give you samples. They do rush you a little but hey, its a business so I can let that slide. I also like the hand washing trough outside the bathroom for cleaning up after ribs. The moist brisket was pretty good overall, good flavor and texture, minus a very smoky flavor you come to expect from bbq. 

The Bad - Pork ribs, terrible. No bark at all, only a few flakes of pepper on the outside. The meat was under done, still pink, and fairly tough to tear away from the bone. In fact it did not tear away very well at all. Then there was the problem that the ribs really had no real flavor at all. Any trace of smoke flavor was non existent, they tasted under boiled and them exposed to a little grilling for some small but meaningless char. BBQ sauce on the table was likewise horrible. The non spicy one tastes like ketchup with a few herbs in it, the hot one tasted like they added a little tabasco to the first one. 

Overall I love the concept and some of their food. When you charge the prices they do and make the claims they make about their food, they have set the bar themselves. The brisket was the only thing really keeping them from a 1 star review. Very nice people, great business model, but unfortunately, overall, the food just does not seem to be worth it."}

Huge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.

Ordered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!

A friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her "Well, lemme see what I can do". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh

No add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.

I love the Prime Rib!  Yes, it's $9.49 for 1/2 lb, but can I make prime rib at home like this?  No.  Not even going to try.  I'll pay the premium.  Prime Rib is offered only Fri-Sun.

The brisket is either really good, or not.  The brisket at Can't Stop Smoking is always good.

The pulled pork here is phenomenal!  

The sides here are better than at Can't Stop Smokin, in my opinion.  

One of the overlooked menu items is the Jumbo Baked Potato.  I usually get one loaded with meat.  Talk about a meal!!  Guaranteed to stuff you for the night. 

The bbq sauces are a bit tame.  I still love Famous Dave's 'Devils Spit.'  

All in all, a very good place to eat, and it is no frills.  You don't have a waiter, but you might have to wait.  Usually a line at the place, even almost 4 months after they opened.

The past four times, it's been especially bad.  Today the "moist" brisket was so dry that it is nearly inedible. It's texture was more like over-cooked roast beef than it was BBQ. I had to drown it in sauce to give it any kind of moisture. Most Texans will tell you that if brisket is done right you don't need any sauce. The meat should speak for itself, and today, the meat said, "You really should eat elsewhere." And then, there's the pulled pork... It's just horrible.

It is like a whimsical diner, you grab everything yourself and then you stand in line to see your cashier and chat with him regarding what you possibly could want. You order it all by weight and in our order was baby back ribs, pulled pork and the lean brisket. (The reason for the lean, is that the one they call moist - I call fatty.)

Baby back ribs. 
No, I was far from impressed. Yes, they were OK but not all that meaty and I actually make better ones in my smoker. Also, I have serious doubt that these were baby backs.

Pulled pork.
Was OK, but nothing spectacular. Very basic. 

Brisket.
Quite nice actually. But not nice enough to just come here for the brisket.

Sides. 
I know it was made on the premises, but it all tasted prefab - I was not impressed.

Nor was i impressed by this do it yourself and eat like an animal kind of place. I can see myself taking foreigners here as a novelty, but as for quality of food and pleasing experience this will not be my choice of place. For kids I can see the lawlessness of playing with your food without silverware and without plates (yes, wax paper straight onto the picnic table) but as an adult I find this not entertaining and just cater to those who wants to rebel against civilization.

Mistake, When in Phoenix we are always trying out new places to keep up with my "Yelp" searches.   So unfortunately, being this is a chain restaurant which I do not ascribe to,  I put Abuelo's on the back burner.  Starting  with the chips and salsa was a real treat.  The chips are very thin, crispy and no grease.  Less calories.  Gotta start somewhere with calorie counting when it comes to Mexican food.  The salsas were awesome.  The green one is the best I ever had.  I could just munch on chips and the green salsa and forget the food.  I asked the server what it comprised of.  To my surprise, it was mixed with fresh pineapple and cilantro. We all ordered an assortment of the usual Mexican fare, enchilladas, chille rellanos, The rice was very tasty as well as mashed potatoes Mexican style which was awesome.  It is called Papas.  Huge portions.  The restaurant itself is a nice setting,  like you are sitting in an outdoor plaza.  I do wish they would come to the Tucson area."}

The ceiling in the center courtyard reminds you of Venetian at Las Vegas. The place is decorated with wall arts and artificial plants around. We didn't see much crowd for a Saturday lunch and were seated in a minute. 

As we sat, we were given freshly made tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were thin and crispy, salsa was ok for my taste. They have a wide menu option and we ordered jalapeño cheese fritters for appetizers. It was more of cheese fritters, there was very slight hint of jalapeño. We further ordered tilapia tacos, firecracker shrimp tacos and vegetarian fajitas. One can chose flour or corn tacos.  The tacos was served with cilantro rice and beans. The rice was one of the best I have had, wasn't impressed with the bean though. Full points for the tacos, right amount of shrimp, veggies and pieces of mango. I loved how it was not filled with lettuce, which made it easier to eat. The fajita qty is a lot for one person with rice and beans along. The taste was alright but not as good as the tacos. 
We finished our meal with caramel flan, the showstopper. The flan was rich, creamy and moist. Loved every bit of it. The price is average and would recommend this place for any Mexican food lover."}

When the people coordinating the line found out I had never been there before, they gave me the intro. Sounds like a meat out.  They had lots of choices for meats all smoked.  We got there about noon, and it had a line to the front door.  Interestingly enough, the line did seem to move pretty. At the register, they asked me if I wanted to sample anything (since I hadn't been before).  I went with the smoked turkey.  Wow.  I have to say that this is the 1st time that I've gotten turkey that was not bone dry. The turkey was charred on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Color me happily surprised.  =)  After reading the reviews on here, I decided to skip all the sides, but did get a sample of the green chili soup.  I think that would be a winner. That taste was most excellent, and it had veggies.  Most of the sides seemed to be a mayo fest, so it was a good call on the skip.  My co-worker, got the prime rib - apparently they offer it on the weekend.  I was less impressed with his prime rib.  My key takeaway from this visit was to go with someone and share. I found 1/2 pound of turkey just WAY too much.  My co-worker was happy to finish it off for me.  My one only slight complaint is that this is must more of a family ho-down type place than a nice dinner out.  I'd suggest getting it to go and doing your own sides at home to go with the excellent smoked turkey.  =)"}

I first went to Rudy's with my husband and 2 of our kids. Our daughter lives in San Antonio and we were there in October to visit. She raved about Rudy's so we went and she was right it was delicious! It was attached to the back of a gas station, but hey I already know dive joints have the best grub. Some of the very best smoked BBQ I have ever tasted. 
I was sad to leave San Antonio because this BBQ is just that good!

Fast forward we are back in Phoenix and I am discussing BBQ with a friend and talking about Little Miss BBQ opening in Central Phoenix. I haven't been there yet but I'm going. Anyway I bring up the Yelp app to show some of the LMB reviews and someone mentioned Rudy's! I thought are they in Texas, is this the same Rudy? Faster than my fingers could type I found 2 locations in AZ one in Chandler and one in Goodyear. I am in between both of them! Well this one is on my husbands way home from work! Bonus! I had no Idea this was a chain! I never would have thought it was a chain based on my Texas experience. It truly looks and feels like a mom and pop joint!

Well the very next day I sent my husband to get us some Rudy's for dinner!

Brisket moist - this juicy fatty delicious brisket OMG Brisket nirvana! 
If you don't like fatty meat don't get the moist cut, just be warned that the lean cut is no where near as moist because of the missing fat. 

Turkey - You delicious smoked bird tender and oh so flavorful!

Sausage regular - Smoked to perfection just the right amount of spice nice snap when you bite into it. 

Beans - creamy and delicious not sweet more cowboy beans.

Creamed corn - this is so good, whole kernel sweet corn in a creamy sauce. This is a great compliment to their pulled pork!


In short my favorite item is the Brisket moist cut I give it 10 stars*********"}

I just don't like the beans or Cole slaw here. Even though I am a huge Cole slaw and bean eater. The BQ sauce here I actually do not like. The cheapy Kraft BQ sauce at the store is better than here. It seems to have to much vinegar in it. The bottles to dispense the BQ sauce are hard to deal with. It's like they don't want you to use their sauce. Maybe that's a good thing. I was in the area and thought I would try it again. But to no surprise still the same. 
All the meats are really great but the sauce and extras just don't set the tone for me.
 I couldn't eat the beans. The BQ sauce has now upset the stomach. I know a lot of people like many things here but it doesn't cut the mustard with me or rather the sauce."}

I've eaten at Rudy's all over TX and was happy to see they opened one here.  I've always been a huge fan of their moist brisket and the ribs.  Little did I know about the breakfast tacos.  Now they are a new addiction.  For $1.70 you get a fat stuffed taco with egg, cheese, and your choice of smoked meat.  They also have tacos without meat which have fried potatoes instead.  Heaven in a tortilla.

Some of the other Rudy's reviewers would have a nervous breakdown if they ever went to Kreuz Market in Lockhart, TX (which in my opinion is the best smoked meat anywhere).  Kreuz's has signs that say No Sauce No Forks, and you have to sit at picnic tables with strangers!  (gasp!!!)

Our world needs more of the Texas-style good ol' good time to be found at these kinds of BBQ places.  Go to Rudy's, order the smoked meat that your heart desires, or that your stomach is craving, grab a cold beer from one of the ice-filled tubs, make some new friends, and relax.  You won't regret it."}

We moved here from the south (Arkansas) and are always looking for some "down home" cooking. I am a fan of Memphis style BBQ so I wasn't too fond of their sauces. We ordered 1/2 lb of brisket, pulled pork, and Baby Backs...corn on the cob, cream corn, potatoe salad, and beans. The brisket and baby backs were amazing but the pulled pork had too much pepper. All the sides were good except the beans...bland. My partner loved her cream corn. I like the way they serve you and I had to chuckle when i seen the white bread...brought back memories. Overall, we had good "down home" food at a fair price. We will return:)"}

After the meeting and before heading to the airport I was happy to find out this is the same Rudy's. It was great. The killer was the moist brisket. It was almost sinful. It was juicy, had a good bark, and was not fatty (a difficult mix). The regular brisket was just as good -- it had more of a bark and was still moist. The ribs had an ton of flavor.

If I had to choose, I'd just go for the brisket. They were both insane. And forget the mild sauce; the regular sauce was barely spicy.

Seriously, the negative reviews are ridiculous. Abuelo's menu is something I call "upscale Mexican" for lack of a better moniker. Their food is always fresh, excellent and nicely presented. If it isn't spicy enough for your taste, they have four salsas to put on it (ask your waiter for the habanero salsa, they don't routinely bring it out), their portions are generous and their prices are very reasonable. I've never had a bad food or service experience in any Abuelo's in the country. The restaurants are all outfitted similarly, and they're beautiful inside. Booths are roomy, and there is a nicely elegant "feel" to the dacor. This is an excellent place to take a date, or dine out for an occasion.
If you're interested in great food, tasty desserts, large portions and fair prices, ignore the "this person just can't be pleased" negative reviews and eat here. You'll be glad you did."}

You can tell by the labels on the packaging that it's mass-produced and shipped from a warehouse (No different than what you would find at the supermarket after the deli section has closed). Despite some of the unimpressive sides, the brisket was excellent. I really like that they slice it to order, and that they give you choices for different types of cuts. It had a strong beef flavor and pretty pronounced smoke which I like with beef BBQ.  The sauce was perfect -- a blend of heat, sweetness, and tomato -- for brisket and probably for pork ribs.  To be fair, I didn't try the pulled pork, but I imagine that this sauce is too overpowering for pork, at least for my taste.  That aside, the brisket in and of itself is worth the trip.  I'd definitely come back for the brisket."}

Sampled Moist and Regular Brisket and smoked turkey.

The brisket was moist. They do it right. Melts in your mouth and you can basically chew it with your tongue.Smoky pork goodness galore!
The slaw was ..meh. No tang, mostly cabbage in a bland watery sauce.
The potato salad was good. Nothing to write home about, but it had a good tang to it and was not off-putting.
Free drink refills. Large gets you a big plastic cup that you can bring back in for $.75 refills. 
I drove from north Phoenix to met a friend for lunch on my day off and I would say it was worth the trip.
My buddy had the beans, which he stated in his review, were bland. Even after doctoring them up with BBQ sauce.

I'll start off with positives: beautiful interior. Great paintings on the wall. Our server, Jorge, was fantastic and prompt. The rice was nice and fluffy, not greasy. My steak inside my chimichanga was delicious (this is also a negative, read further for details).
Negatives: so, my best friend is Mexican so I know what really fantastic Mexican food tastes like and I'm sorry to say but this place doesn't have it. I ate more chips and salsa than I did of my own food. The Chile con queso tasted like Kraft American cheese slices melted and poured over my chimichanga, no joke, even gave some to my husband to make sure it wasn't just me. Husband's beef and cheese chimichanga had next to no meat, he basically had fried bread, which being native, I could've made him at home.  The beans tasted... burnt, which we all know is a very distinct taste.
And for a very unexpected turn: we asked what the dessert options were, he listed them and I got excited when he said, "margarita pie", like what?? MARGARITA PIE?!? YES!!! Came out, yeah, it's keylime pie. That's it. Sadness."}

The seduction of the sweet aroma of BBQ smoke draws you to the front door.  Once inside, you know this is going to be good.  This is the BEST BBQ I've ever had!  There is no question about it, this is the go to place for incredible BBQ. We tried the Baby Back ribs, the Moist Brisket, the Pulled Pork sandwich, the Pork Loin sandwich, the Sausage, and the Coleslaw.  Everything was outstanding!  My favorites were the Moist Brisket, Baby Back Ribs and the Sausage.  That is not to say the pork sandwiches were not great because they were, it is just a personal preference.  Rudy's is well organized and able to move a large line of people through to the order and pickup counter very quickly.  

When you are in line, you have a responsibility.  That responsibility is to decide what you want before you get to the counter, and please don't hold everyone else up by standing in front of the refrigerators trying to decide which size coleslaw you want.  You will forfeit your place in line.  Once you've ordered and picked up your food; your condiments, self service drinks and wax paper are your next stops before securing your table.  The environment is absolutely "family fun"!  At your table you will find two BBQ sauce choices.  One is labeled for sissy's, the other is for...well...everyone else!  There are some great desserts that include some serious chocolate pudding, cobbler, pies and Rice Crispy treats.  If you didn't pick up your dessert when you were in line ordering your meat, no worries, you can buy your favorite treats from the little shop on the left as you first came inside Rudy's and either take it back to your table or home with you for that special late night snack. 

There is plenty of parking and Rudy's is well located for easy access off of Chandler Blvd near I-10.  I hope Rudy's will some day consider opening a restaurant in San Diego!  This will be a must stop when visiting in Chandler."}

First off, the vibe as soon as you walk in it that of a lunch joint.  It basically looks like a cafeteria.  You shuffle through line and select drinks and sides from the cooler on your way to the counter. Once there, you order and food comes up pretty fast.  The food is served on wax paper, and there are no plates.  Also, no silverware, just plastic utensils. This may be a traditional way to serve BBQ, but when it comes time to cut your brisket, an actual plate and silverware would be nice.  I ended up getting more than one bite with wax paper stuck to the bottom of the brisket.

I ordered the Jalapeno sausage, lean brisket, and corn on the cob.  The sausage was excellent, but again difficult to cut with a plastic knife.  I should have ordered the moist brisket, because the lean brisket was very dry.  The corn was over-cooked and over-buttered.  They have a couple BBQ sauces, neither of which were anything to write home about.  They don't sell corn bread... that's right, no corn bread!  Overall I was not impressed with the food at all.

Service was friendly, and they clear your table when they see empty plates... sorry empty wax papers.  Prices are reasonable.  Rudy's seems like a good spot for lunch BBQ, but don't expect excellence here."}

The sweet tea is great.  When you find sweet tea around here it is usually outrageously sweet, this was not, it was perfectly sweetened and was not too we.  The potato salad was also quite good.  

Now the bad:

The way this restaurant is set up is horrible.  It is probably a safe bet that you will spend as long or longer standing in line than you will actually eating.  If you happen to come during an off time, you may only have to wait twenty minutes or so to order your food.  If you show up during a busy period, there is no telling how long you'll be standing in line.  I understand that the food is all pre made and in theory it should be possible to quickly move people through the line and to their seats.  For whatever reason it really does not work in practice.  There has to be a better way.

I get it, Texans love the wax paper thing.  That's great.  Here's the thing; try ordering the prime rib, carry it back to your picnic table and start cutting it up with one of their plastic knives.  If you are anything like me, once your plastic knife has cut through the wax paper and rubbed your steak around on the bare table a couple of times you'll decide the best approach is to just eat the steak with your hands.  Granted, the wax paper and plastic cutlery probably works fine with the rest of the menu, but it doesn't work at all with the prime rib.  

Despite all of the issues, I will probably be back.  My wife had the ribs and they were quite good, and I am betting that the brisket is great as well.  The fact is, there just aren't that many good BBQ restaurants in the area.  The prime rib was a bad choice, and that choice is really what lead to the bad experience.  I look forward to a better visit next time."}

Initially my daughter declined appetizers so we could actually eat our lunch, but I couldn't resist - ordering Spring Rolls from the tapas section and a Shrimp Cocktail from the "regular" appetizer list.  The Spring Rolls were "eh," (and I wouldn't order them again) but the Shrimp Cocktail was amazing and actually the most tasteful item of those ordered.  It consisted of at least a dozen shrimp, and was served in a huge margarita glass with pita chips on the side.  It was definitely a sharable amount for four people, but the two of us ate it all and were then too full for our "real" lunch.  Within 5 minutes of presenting our volcano hot entrees, our server returned asking if we'd like a box for leftovers.  Two full plates came home.  Reheated Mexican food is never good but we made an attempt for dinner...yuck.

BBQ is about MEAT! The atmosphere is decent, and they move the line pretty quick. I had the Cutter's Choice brisket ($6.19) and a side of Rudy's beans ($2), while my cohort had the pulled pork($5). The brisket was too dry for my taste, and the rub overpowered the smoke flavor. The quality of the meat was ok. The beans were almost all spice and no flavor, My friend's pulled pork was nice and smoky, but had a stringy texture, and was almost waterlogged. Neither of the "sauses" seemed to complement the meats, adding an unbalanced tartness to the food  For desert, I tried the peach cobbler, which was disapointing, as well, with what tasted like canned peaches, and a really soggy crust. For the money, there is better Q in town. Probably won't be back here"}

I usually order 'The Laredo' which is an enchilada dish with beans and rice it's delicious and while it is a sizable portion it's not overwhelming. The atmosphere here is lovely you aren't talking over anyone and the booths are a bit taller so you have some privacy which is a big plus for me.

Nothing tasted fresh, my shrimp were rubbery, fajitas were mostly onions and bland. Nothing was worth going back for. Plus it was wayyy too expensive.

The corn on the cob was a soggy mess, it had to have been sitting in water for hours. The beans had decent flavor but I ordered a medium serving and got 95% juice with a extremely small portion of beans. The pulled pork was below average, and since the sauce is so poor, it couldn't help the pork. The peach cobbler was disgusting, it had a undercooked gooey dough crust!!!! Overall it is much too pricey for the quality of food. Save your money and make the trip to Mesa and hit up Waldos. Or if you want a chain BBQ place, Famous Dave's is a much better choice."}

They actually started in Lubbock, Texas and moved West.
     Our server Nina was definitely a Keeper. She has a long tenure at this eatery.
The chip and salsa were a bit off. The chips are very thin and came stuck together.
The green salsa with pineapple was tasty but the other two red ones didn't get to first base. 
  The jalapeno cheese puffs were not too special. They were hollow inside with a small amount of jalapeno and a touch of sour cream.
    The main event was where they shine;
The enchilada plate with an avocado with cream enchilada was lights out. The ground beef
with chili was also tasty. The beans and special house mashed potatoes were great.
    The chili Relleno was way up there with a tasty poblano pepper and great picadillo.
The beef enchilada was a winner as was the beans and house potatoes. The fresh, hot, corn tortillas made a complete dinner.
    Having a Pro for our server made this a great experience. I found out that Abuelo's
honors our veterans with a nice discount. I asked because I recently found out that one of my favorite restaurants in San Antonio had been doing this for forty years and I just found out about this year."}

Let me start with the seating arrangement. The restaurant still has at least 5 booths that were opened. I didn't think I'll need to special request for sitting there. They decided to sit us on a table for 4 in between 2 other tables that were full. The space was so tight that there was no way we could sit comfortably. As always, I asked to be re-seated. 

When we finally sat down, the waiter showed up asking us what we wanted to drink. During the meantime, you would think that someone would at least gave us a glass of water while waiting right? I didn't even notice it until I ate some salsa and tried reaching for the water. Nothing. Great! This is just great!

We started ordering our entrees. Food arrived at decent time. When we were done, the waiter didn't even give us a chance to order dessert and was ready to wrap things up. We stopped and told him that we wanted dessert. 

When we were done, we still wanted to hang around to catch up with friends. I guess the waiter feels that it was time for us to leave, he told us that we could pay with the machine on the table and that is that. After he said that, he never come by again. He stopped coming by to see if we want refills or maybe we wanted to order something else? 

I also would like to add that it is 40 or below tonight. All of us were wearing sweaters. The air circulation was so bad that we were all sweating at the restaurant. It was so stuffy and hot in there. 

All in all, the food is decent, but the service was definitely horrible. If management is reading this, please train your servers to continue offering service after bills were paid. We don't want to stay there for an hour after we are done with our meals. But seriously????"}

When I first heard of it from family that lives in Phoenix, I was impressed with the quality but had a few reservations about the details. 

We came in last week and should have turned around when we arrived at 11:50 and there was nobody in line. Last two times we were here the line was out to the door. Hmmm. I am a quick learner and I value where I spend my hard earned money especially when you have to pay this much for a lunch. It better be great, which it wasn't. 
We got the Brisket, Pork Ribs, chicken and the brisket Baked Potato. 
Everything was cold and so boring looking that it looked as if it had come out of the freezer minutes before, defrosted then microwaved and thrown on my plate. The ribs were terrible, cold and chewy. The chicken was so cold and didn't even have a golden color to it' it was just cold chicken that without a blob of sauce was flavorless so that went into the trash almost uneaten. The Brisket Potato was so cold it was depressing. We couldn't even get the butter to melt and had to cut the potato with a knife as the fork wouldn't get it done. Cold brisket on a cold potato with cold butter and, well, cold sour cream, terrible. Over half of that mess went into the trash as well. The brisket by itself was the only thing that made the grade you would expect from a BBQ place that brags about their food. 
We spent over $60 for two adults and two little kids and wished we had stopped for a burger instead. My wife said to send it back but I was so mad about the whole meal and cost so I just wanted to get out of there and I assure you we will not be back."}

I like mustard style potato salad. The sauce had a slight kick but nothing to crazy. I paid $13 for a brisket sammich, LG drink, 6oz tater salad and 6oz slaw. But all in all it's good.

Oh dear lawd.  My sister was right.  We got the dipping sampler - the guac was to die for.  The white cheese dip made my tail wag too.  

I got the white sauce chicken enchilada and was stunned by the serving size. It could feed a family of four.  Or one very hungry Theresa if she was wearing her fat stretchy pants.  Thankfully, I had the sense to get a box and get half of it off my place lest I leave with a food baby.

All this to say - when hubby and I are in the valley again, this will be my destination for lunch.  (The dinner prices are a bit on the steep side for my budget.)  


Give 'em a try!  PS  My sister had a coupon for a free appetizer so the total bill was around $20.  You could spend that much at a crummy fast food place!"}

The quality is just as good as the Texan counterpart. The lean brisket is flavorful and the chicken is juicy. You almost don't need the sauce but it's so delicious so why not?! My favorite: a 1:1 mixture of both of their sauces. Trust. 

All food orders are given with all you can eat white bread. You can also request wheat, for the bbq amateurs out there. White bread is part of the experience people!

I was clean and well lit.

The food was great.  The chips and salsa were a step above a normal Mexican restaurant.  The were served with 3 salsa's.  One tasted a little sweet (I think it had kiwi in it).  It is my new favorite.

The enchiladas were good.  The chili relleno was Dynamite.   The portions were huge.

What you people here in Arizona call Mexican food is equivalent to a gas station taco in Texas, no offense, but you know how Mexican food differs from state to state and everyone loves what they're used to... even when it's shameful!
I rarely eat Mexican food these days unless it's a burrito, cause you can mess up a burrito... very often. 
I don't remember the Abuelo's back home being this delicious, so maybe I'm just homesick, but the first time I ate here, I had to excuse myself to have a cry in the bathroom -- I was so happy.  Tex-Mex has it's own name against the rest of Mexican food for a reason. 
The atmosphere here is soft and comfortable, and the service is exceptional.  It is a bit pricy, but the portions are... Shall I say it? Alright, Texas sized and it doesn't taste like it been rolled in dirt and places under a heat lamp for 12 years. 
Take it from a Texan, this is Tex-Mex, and if you don't like it, then you're simply partial to your own state's form of Mexican food... which makes me a very sad man.
As far as the bar is concerned, my mojito was overpriced and too sweet and my beer was just overpriced but still delicious."}

Not that there isn't any other good bbq places in town, there are plenty, but, this is a pulled pork city. And, I am a sliced brisket man. 
One knock on Rudys is that you have to eat-in, the taste and texture of the meat changes dramatically when travelling, even a short distance. Had Rudys for an event at work and it wasn't quite the same, good, but not great like when you eat at the store. 
Still.....there is no denying that when it comes to barbecue, Rudys is the one for me.

But here's the deal, the food was good.  As grumpy as I was when I finally got it, I really enjoyed it.  Well...the meats.  The sides, blah.  My favorite was the moist brisket.  No need to order anything else.  The pulled pork was ok, as well as the sausages.  But no comparison with the brisket.

The concept is executed well from start to finish, if you want some bbq and want to feel like you're at a family cookout, this spot will deliver. 

When we first walked in we must have clearly looked lost because an employee greeted us and gave us a quick rundown. Everything is al a carte, meats come by the 1/2 pound. You walk by beverages in a glass bottle available for purchase on your way to the front, but they also have traditional soda machines as well. 

There is a cooler near the register where you can grab cold sides (coleslaw, potato salad, etc) and desserts. Then you make your way to the register to order your meat and hot sides. They will weigh your meat in front of you on a scale and get everything you need together in a little crate thing. They also ask if you want any white or wheat bread. Service at the register is friendly as well. 

After paying you can grab your drinks and they have another little bar area to self serve pickles, onions, etc plus silverware and napkins. It's open seating and most tables are long communal tables. There are sauces placed every so often down the tables for you to enjoy. 

As for the food, it's pretty solid bbq. While my girlfriend was disappointed in no mac n cheese option, we grabbed a side of coleslaw, potato salad and corn on the cob. I got a 1/2 pound of pulled pork and she got a 1/2 pound of turkey. They recommend a 1/2 pound of meat per person but I was pretty full. if you get a few sides you could definitely split. 

The pulled pork was to be expected, it was tender. The turkey was the best she has tried at any bbq place, not dry and flavorful. I tried both bbq sauces and wasn't impressed though.. this was my letdown of the meal. The sauce is super tangy and I usually can do with a touch more sweet with my bbq. Wasn't awful I've just had better and wasn't a fan. 

The coleslaw and potato salad were as expected too. Nothing life changing but good solid sides. 

The food is a solid 3.5 and the atmosphere boosts it to a 4. A fun bbq experience and really awesome staff. Bathrooms are nice and clean too. They also have a hand washing station outside the bathrooms if you get crazy trying to eat ribs or something."}

The brisket: I've been to this location three times. Once the brisket was ok, sort of tender, I actually enjoyed it. Twice the brisket was dry and tough. Really tough, like there is no mistaking this Brisket for tender. Like obviously the cook doesn't care. Also, on my most recent trip I asked for the bark to be left on. They just flipped it upside down and gave it to me with the top lopped off anyway. 

Sausage: good enough.

This place isn't horrible. It's ok. I just wish they'd put a little more soul behind the BBQ. BBQ is expensive. It would be nice if they tried to make it worth it to spend the money at Rudys."}

They also offer drinks which I opted for the margarita but they literally have a full bar so you can have anything you want... The place is very beautiful so you can sit outside, inside, or at the bar. The prices are a lil bit high, dinner for 2 was around 60-80$ average plate of food is 20$ and drinks about 8$.

We ordered the extra moist brisket with a half a loaf of white bread, baby back ribs, sweet corn and potato salad. The brisket was the best and nice juicy ribs. The meat doesn't come with any bbq sauce cause it's really good without the sauce I tried the sissy sauce and that was good with the brisket. Oh my gosh so good. The sweet corn is so good. I just love the BBQ here. I just wish they would open one in the north east area. Will I be back? You bet."}

Theirs was the best brisket around here. Now, despite the smoke ring there is almost no smoke flavor. Couldn't taste any rub either.  You have to drown it in sauce to get any flavor (and good BBQ does NOT need sauce!).  The only worthwhile things now are the sausage and green chili stew. Not enough to recommend them.

I have no plan to return.  It's only slightly closer than Joe's, and Joe's is so much better."}

On the positive side, at least they have several decent vegetarian options. On the negative side, all of those options are loaded with greasy cheese and have very little seasoning.
The sangria tastes like fruit juice - ick.

Yet another disappointing Mexican restaurant in Phoenix - then again, I should have known better. It is a huge, corporatized chain outside a shopping mall..."}

Like really, really good. Having eaten my fair share of BBQ in TX, this was consistent in what you would expect from Rudy's.

#1 PROBLEM: This location has a meat Carver that cuts all the bark off of the meat. WHO DOES THAT?! It is like taking a perfectly cooked steak and then finishing it on high for 5 minutes in the microwave!! Stupid. When I asked them to recarve it, I got some serious eye rolling and attitude from that side of the counter. 

The worst part about this is that I started by asking if they sell burnt ends. The employee behind the counter said "we keep all the bark on, so each peice has some."  

Retrain or replace, period. 

Side note: the napkins are by the butcher paper, at the table with condiments. There SHOULD be rolls at EVERY TABLE next to the sauce, as it always was at each Rudy's I ate at in TX. When you have a bunch of food on your hands/shirt/pants, the last thing you need is a walk of shame to the napkins."}

I went on a date and she has been wanting to go here for a long time, and she didn't know I don't like Mexican food because it was our first date. I can find something on any menu to eat, so it was no big deal for me really, I wanted her to be happy (awwww such a nice guy!). We arrived, waited only a few minutes and were seated.

We were greeted promptly by our server, can't recall his name though but he was rather serious in demeanor. He took our drink order and promptly returned with our drinks. My date had a mango Margarita and she loved it. But then it kind of went south a little from there. When he took our food order, I told him I wanted Prime Rib. His reply was " we don't have that". Confused, I reached for the menu because I know I saw it, and it was only then he said Prime Rib was only available on Thursdays. This was a Sunday. Ok, kind of 'short' in his response/approach, but let's move on. He took our orders with less enthusiasm than I've seen on a 2 year old's face in a timeout and then he left.

The food came VERY fast and my date loved hers. Mine was good. We were done for quite a while before the server returned. I asked if they had desserts. He responded by pointing at a menu tent on the table and walked away. That was nothing short of rude in my opinion. He was gone for a while but we were able to get our dessert order in and received it promptly, but then proceeded to sit there for a good 15 minutes after we were done before he came to our table with the bill. He visited the table next to us 3 times in that 15 minute period. We decided to sit and chat for a bit after that, again 1st date and it went GREAT by the way :) The server came back to our table and picked up the signed credit card receipt, just asked if it was ready. I said yes. He took it and walked away. No "thank you". No "come back again", nothing. He had his money and he was gone!

Overall.. good food, decent atmosphere, greeters were friendly but this server was not. Sorry he had a bad day.. but don't drag down your customers. Customer service really seems to be going downhill in general."}

Very disappointed. I was then offered Mexican rice and politely accepted it, but that was spicy and not good to me. 

One of the Brisket Taco's was soggy and totally fell apart when I barely grabbed it to eat. I politely asked for a side of corn tortillas so I could remake my taco that fell apart. By time the the new corn tortilla arrived the brisket was cold on the taco that fell apart and the new tortillas were as hard as frisbees ‍ The restaurant remade my brisket tacos which was amazing, but still with the wait, hard crunchy tortillas and still not having rice  and the restaurant not at least comping something it wasn't a pleasant experience."}
