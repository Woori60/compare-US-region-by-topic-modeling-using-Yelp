I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone."}

Their Fried Wontons put everyone else to shame, though. Crab Rangoon also delicious, sometimes a little overdone but as far as affordable chinese food goes, I gladly drive the hike up Green Valley to their location by the 215 just for them even though Amlee is across the street (btw, Amlee- NEVER AGAIN).

Thank goodness because my grandparents and I just got done with a dreaded 2 hour dr appointment and was starving!

I order the chicken and Waffles and it was delicious! It came with 3 huge pieces of fried chicken with 4 pieces of waffles topped with what looked and tasted like strawberry butter. I should've took a picture but a picture was the last thing on my mind since it looked so yummy and I was starving lol.

My grandparents ordered the fried chicken sandwich and that too was huge and delicious!

If you get to choose your waiter, John was pleasant/funny and very attentive. He told us that our food might take longer than expected.

Highly recommend trying this place!"}

We're not so much for the fancy stuff. I very much appreciate Metro's decor, which harkens back to the original diners. enjoyed the chicken-fried steak and the hash. I wouldn't get the pot pie again, as they use rolled-out biscuit dough as crust. The best crust (and a flaky one) for pot pies is James Beard's recipe, which uses egg yolks as an enrichment. There will be plenty left over to take home. The waitpersons are trippy and very helpful. One day I asked for mashed potatoes....and they didn't have any...is that unforgivable for a diner? Stuck with fries again. I will definitely be trying their stuffing waffles sometime soon. We'll be getting a Metro Diner on Serene at Eastern (near WalMart and Home Depot), which will attract a lot of people down off the hill."}

Absolutely love their chow mein and sweet & sour chicken. Pro tip regarding sweet & sour chicken....most places give you the sauce on the side and refuse to mix it in the wok. I hate that. China Tango is more than happy to mix it in the wok so you're not left dipping when you get home. 

They give you so much food it's ridiculous. A 2 item combo is enough for two people plus left overs. Most Chinese restaurants (other than Panda) have a lunch menu then cut off all the combos for dinner time. Not China Tango. Their meal-deal is available all the time. Entree, side item (fried/white rice or chow mein), cup of soup, egg roll and crab rangoon. 

Another cool thing, when you order to go they give you your food in a box if it's a large order. Keeps it from sloshing all over the place on the drive home and is a really nice touch to keep things steady. Appreciate the extra effort that they give. 

Far and away my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area."}

Fried rice: The fried rice is dry or undercooked... I'm not sure which. It doesn't have much flavor and it's pretty bland. It's hard to eat due to the texture. 

General chicken:
You can tell the restaurant is trying to save money. Although the portions are large, the quality is not good. The chicken has a weird texture. It's dry inside and mushy on the outside. 

*The styrofoam container for the chicken melted and changed shape. They should invest in better quality containers that don't LEAK. 

*If you do decide to order from here, be sure to get enough napkins/ soy sauce/ forks because i received exactly ONE of each. For two people.

Service was good, maybe a little inexperienced but very nice.

Good thing we arrived early because by the time we left, people were lining up inside and out.

I'm not sure I'll be back for breakfast, but I will try their lunch / dinner menu. I was informed that they serve their entire menu breakfast/lunch/dinner all day.

No delivery at this time, but you can place an order and come pick it up."}

The little shop on Trop and Flamingo was set up like a drive in theater with a big(at the time)screen tv.
The waitress wore bright pink, dangling ball earrings and always greater everyone with a sweet voice and a smile.
Meals were delicious, affordable and ended with a piece of Bazooka!
Today the Metro empire has grown to all parts of the Valley. That's a good thing...yes, there is a but. As the company has grown the quality of the meals has dropped. The cost of a pizza is now ridiculous! 
I'm sad. We? the neighborhoods, have made you.

Monday morning around 9:30 i came in for the first time to try the diner out. Surprised with how cozy the atmosphere was and there was also a number of people inside. I decided to sit at the bar/counter and here's where it almost went bad. I sat there for a good 5/6 minutes and no one had came over for a drink order or said welcome or anything. Luckily the kitchen staff alerted the manager who was working to get orders out to tables that I needed my order taken. She IMMEDIATELY came over and apologized, asked what I wanted, and she said that it would be right out. She must've pushed my order ahead or something cause it came out in like 2 minutes. I ordered buttered white toast, eggs over easy (perfectly cooked), and biscuits and gravy. Food was really good, nothing that wow'd me but i ordered biscuits and gravy so that's expected. 

All in all. The metro diner is a cozy little diner with staff who have attention to detail and want to make sure you have a quality visit. They even held the door open for me on my way out. Hope that helps you out!!"}

My eggs were not over hard they were slimy on one side and my toast was dry as hell with no butter at all. I asked for butter and after waiting for quite awhile i got totally burnt toast. I asked again for new toast and as we were about to leave i got one piece of okay toast.

For $15, you get half of a chicken (drumstick, wing, thigh & breast) with 4 pieces of their popular Belgian Waffles.

We decided to just get a side order of their chicken since we wanted to get other breakfast items. My friend and I decided to just get 1 drumstick each. 
- They charged us $7 for the 2 small drumsticks.
- Holy crap, it was near inedible as it was a complete salt bomb. 
- My friend commented that they've been really inconsistent with their fried chicken lately. 
1st time: It was "delicious, the best fried chicken I've ever had." 
2nd time he had it, he said it was "super bland", so bland that he had to add salt to it himself. 
3rd time/yesterday: We damn near got high blood pressure. All you could taste was the salt.

BREAKFAST CROISSANT ($7): 
You can't go wrong with eggs, bacon and cheese. Very generous with the eggs and cheese, it was basically spilling over. What I didn't like was getting only 2 dinky slices of bacon. 

CRAB CAKE BENEDICT ($14):
Best dish of the day. The two crab cakes were meaty and tasted delicious, the hash brown was crispy and lightly seasoned. 

It took over 25 mins for us to get our food. The kitchen just couldn't keep up, you could see the servers all standing around by the window waiting to pick up their food. Our server was great in coming by frequently to update us on our orders, so an extra star for him and his friendly professional attitude. Metro Diner is lucky to have him."}

If you're used to eating Panda Express, this place is not for you, because it's Chinese food made my actual Chinese people. The chow mein noodles are so good compared to the nasty dry chow mein at other restaurants. I also love the sweet and sour pork! Order the sauce on the side though, because it might be a bit too much haha.

I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm feeling generous.  I gave the W. Trop. location 3 stars as well, but I actually liked that set-up and service there better.  

This location was very busy when we stopped by for dinner, so we sat at the counter to avoid the 45-60 minute wait.  Their counter seating is small and a little odd.  It's right next to the expediter, so we got a firsthand look at why they were so backed up.  He seemed truly lost and didn't want to listen to any of his servers who seemed to know more than he did.  I didn't like how rude he was to them.  The kitchen staff was very nice though.  They actually asked us a couple times what we had ordered because they could see how long we were waiting (over 35 minutes) for our food.

I ordered the Chicken Salad on a salad ($10.49).  It was filling, nothing special, but no complaints on flavor.  Everything was premade, so it should have taken less than 5 minutes to come out.

John got the Meatloaf Plate ($12.99 + $3.99) He asked if he could sub a garden salad for the potatoes and baguette.  The waitress said sure, but didn't mention that it would cost more.  It would have been nice to be told in advance that this was a $4 up charge.  Not a lot of money, but it's kind of crappy to add a charge without notice, especially since a garden salad is only 50 cents more than a side of mashed potatoes.  

Our waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of our visit.  I asked the hostess if we had one after about 10 minutes.  A server came over and took our order, but that's the last time we saw her.  We never got iced tea refills and the kitchen staff just handed us our plates over the counter (which we appreciated).  I had to ask the expediter for a copy of our bill so we could pay and leave.  Maybe we'll try again  in a couple months since the location is perfect for us."}

Our Grandson, Chase (an active Marine based in Camp Pendleton) and his girlfriend Denae had been at the Festival the night previous.  We had picked them up during the melee along with others on Tropicana Ave.  It had been a horrible night for all of us and we had stopped for a quick breakfast before going to the Lexus Hotel to recover belongings and for them to return home. We had previously dined here and loved it.  However, after dining on a super wonderful meal we asked our Server Patience for the check.  The onsite manager, Hanna, informed us their was not charge and they would take care of the check.  They thanked myself (a veteran) and my Grandson for our service and explained how sad they were for the events they had observed at the Festival.  What a wonderful gesture and pleasant surprise from a very concerned group of employees and employers.  I have in the past experienced wonderful service and food.  These people are incredibly gracious, attentive and professional.  It felt like family.  Just wish to thank them for their kindness and tell them they have a customer for life.  We plan to visit them often. They are exactly what a people business should be and they demonstrate great pride in our city and community.  We would recommend them to anyone interested in great food and service in Henderson.  Thank you all for being so wonderful, concerned and thankful. You are the best.

ordered the egg drop soup, eggplant and tofu, and ginger beef with green onion.  egg drop soup was unspectacular, not good and not bad... fortunately, the other 2 dishes were quite good, the eggplant was fresh and combined with the flavorful tofu, the dish was amazing.  next up was the ginger beef dish, i would have eaten it all had the portions been smaller, but that was definitely a plus.  big portions, simply said!!!

i will be returning to sample their other dishes... 4 stars simply because i think their AC wasnt working very well and it was quite warm inside the restaurant.

Especially notable was the friendly and enthusiastic service I received.  They really know how to make you feel welcome.  And the key is that it was genuine friendliness and enthusiasm; they weren't just going through the motions.  I had the avocado veggie wrap which includes fried jalapenos, carrots, spinach, avocado, sour cream, red onions, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ranch dressing.  It came with your choice of side; I had it with french fries that were cooked to my liking, not too crispy and not undercooked either.  The wrap was excellent! The diet coke I had was really good as well.  Sometimes fountain beverages don't have the proper fizz or don't taste right for some other reason, but this was one of the best diet coke's I've had!  

The only negative is for me is that I'm a vegetarian and they don't really have any lunch or dinner choices for the vegetarian other than the aforementioned wrap and a grilled cheese sandwich.  I suppose you could also get a spinach salad and either hold or substitute the bacon for something else.  Another option is to get the macaroni and cheese along with some other side dishes such as cole slaw, sauteed veggies, and fresh fruit.  But otherwise I really loved it and look forward to coming back!"}

I was honestly surprised to see the solid 4 star reviews when I yelped this place AFTER (yes, after) I had lunch here. I was quickly seated upon my arrival (yes, you get wait service when you aren't doing takeout) and asked for my drink order. Upon receiving my drink order I was given egg drop soup and fried wonton strips. I wish I could have been given a choice because I didn't touch either one and am still feeling guilt for wasting food! He took my order and before I could blink my food was at my table! 

So, A+ and bravo for the really great service and large and generous food portions.. But the taste was a no go for me. I am far from a picky eater, but I ended up just eating the fried rice from my meal. I got Kung Pao chicken, and it just wasn't right. The sauce just tasted like a... molten salt lick. No sweetness, a hint of tangy, a ton of salt. And when placing my order, the server warned me it would be spicy, maybe the salt killed the spice? And the texture of the chicken wasn't appealing for my mouth either. One of the reviewers commented on how they deep fry everything which can answer to the texture of the chicken.

I'm glad this is well liked by the community, and I understand why due to the speediness, heaping portions, and small cost, but next time I'll stick with what I know I like."}

I wanted something for brunch time that was close to the Galleria mall (my next destination). It was Saturday around 11am. There was ample parking in front and in the back of the building. There was a 20-25 min wait, but it ended up being less than that. There were many people on staff and everyone who helped us from taking our order to clearing plates was friendly and timely. The menu had a lot of options and I already have some ideas for when I come back! The food was delicious! We got the fruity waffle and breakfast burger for 10 and 14 dollars. And I will say, the food wasn't just good, it was a step up from your typical breakfast place. It was very good. Although I could have stood some more bacon on the burger. I also saw a lot of salad options going by and they all looked incredible. Overall very satisfied with the experience. 

Part 2: I came back the following weekend because my first experience was so good. I was expecting it to be another great experience, but this time it was out of this world! I'm blown away. We ordered chicken and waffles and the bold city burger. Let me tell you, best burger, ever (added avocado). Greatest chicken and waffles ever (tied with Hash House for best dish) except Metro Diner has STRAWBERRY BUTTER! The waffles at Metro are the lightest most amazing waffles ever and I found a piece of real strawberry in my strawberry butter! I can't even express how delicious this meal was (we half/half both dishes via plate swapping) Even the very last bite of the burger had ALL THE TOPPINGS on it. That never happens. John, our server was hilarious and attentive. Never missed a beat. And have I mentioned the music? Everything about this place is superb. Go there. Now!"}

The cheesy grits were an epic fail, I'm a grits gal, and they totally messed up my grits. Too watery, and had too much black pepper. It was not good. Our waiter then started to drift off and was no longer attentive to our needs, he had the label Trainer on the back of his shirt but seemed to be gossiping with his coworkers instead of actually training smh...you would think if the customer mentions the only reason why they came in was because they seen it on Drive Ins Diners and Dives, it should be clear indication they would be writing a review about their experience after the fact , so wouldn't you want to be on your Ps n Qs? Maybe its just me"}

Came here for a high carb/cheat meal. I had the biscuits and sausage gravy with two over medium eggs and home fried potatoes. Yuuuum! They were the best biscuits and gravy I had in a while. The biscuits were so crispy on the edges and soft on the inside (my fav) and the gravy had a good taste. Portions are very generous. I barely touched my potatoes, only had an egg, and maybe 2/4 of the biscuits. It was a lot and I was so stuffed. I was also able to try the strawberry butter (extra charge) with toast and butter and damn that was gooood. 

Large portions, cheap prices, good service.. what more can you ask for?"}

Prices on the various burgers vary from $9.99 to $12.99 and this is the general range for most of the breakfast lunch and dinner entrees (breakfast served any time).  The burgers are a half pound  and they are GOOD QUALITY MEAT.  They are not greasy messes (which causes the buns to become soggy).  They come with a wide assortment of sides from fries to mac and cheese to fresh fruit and several other items.  This is a far better burger than some of the big name burger joints on the strip that are twice as expensive.  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but I look forward to it!  Clean, friendly, excellent food, fast service, that's 5 stars in my book!"}

Had to try this location because i had been to the one on rainbow and forgot to review it....so I took my staff here for our monthly luncheon! We had employees that helped the contractor who was building this location so we wanted to come support them.
My 1st experience at the Rainbow location was good. The food was great but the atmosphere was a little less than I enjoyed. I know this is a diner but the person calling back the orders to the chefs was extremely loud and was very distracting from trying to have a conversation at my table.
I ordered the burger that was made with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and the burger in the middle. It was yummy. I have to say I am extremely picky when it comes to meat...this was good. Well seasoned. I like the lettuce slaw...mayo, lettuce and pickles...perfect idea. For me the only thing that could have made it better was if the crusts were cut off the grilled cheese sandwiches. It was a lot to try to wrap my mouth around and I was very disappointed in the mac N cheese. I thought at a diner it would have been amazing but it tasted like noodles with canned cheese on top. My man had the fried chicken plate. He said it was really good. Very tasty chicken and juicy.
At the Stephanie location , although it was brand new, a lot of employees with trainers, the feeling and vibe was SO much better. The noise was just the patrons enjoying themselves not a man yelling out orders.
Our waitress altough new was very pleasant and did a great job. Her trainer...omg...you guys need to promote him. I wish i remebered his name...he was from Rainbow he said and has only been with the company for 2 months. You would have thought he had been with you for 10 years.
My staff all ordered something completely different. 
Huevos rancheros with chocolate chip,banana pankcakes and the other was a burger with swiss,bacon and mushrooms. I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye! As I stated i am very picky about meat so I was a little hesitant to try the pastrami and I am SOOOO glad I did. It was the best I have ever had!  I will definitely be returning to the Stephanie location!!! I will let my photos speak for themselves!"}

I've visited on several occasions to try out the delicious menu.  Every meal has been wonderful.  The Charleston Shrimp & Grits is my favorite.  The roasted red pepper grit cakes are topped a delicious shrimp and sausage sauce.  It's a very generous dish with always leftovers to take home.  

The Metro Club is also a nicely done sandwich with the amount of meat and ingredients piled into it.  It's lightly toasted bread tries to hold together the mile high sandwich.  I opted to try the Mac & Cheese with the sandwich.  It's decadent and creamy.  I would absolutely order it again as a good side dish.

Well, he was right because it turned out to be the most delicious waffle breakfast I've had in a long time. They even served real maple syrup (not the fake stuff that claims it's real but is made in a factory.) The tea selection was on par with what you'd expect at an afternoon tea in Kensington.

First of all I have found they deliver a lot faster than the 45-60 minutes suggested on the app. We always order about $100 worth of food. There are 3 of us and it lasts a week for leftovers so that's part of the fun. The level of spicy flavor in foods like the pad Thai is fantastic. I love high spice levels and they do a great job. We have tried a huge variety of the menu and it all was delicious. The textures are all excellent and if the food should be crunchy, it's crunchy and if it's supposed to be tender, it is! The amount of food for the price is also excellent and if you order sweet and sour sauce laden items they give you a good sized tub which we like to drizzle over our rice as well. The delivery guy also brings our large order in a cardboard box so nothing spills. We also often get extra fortune cookies. When I moved to Nevada from California we were afraid we would not find a happy Chinese restaurant to order from, but we are highly satisfied. I can hardly wait for the next time we order!"}

That being said, I'm still not placing Tango in the top spot for neighborhood Chinese takeout joints. You'll have to see my other reviews for that. However, it is closing in on the competitors. Today's featured dish is the Garlic Shrimp, which gets an 8 out of 10. 
I've had this a few times and it never disappoints! I love mushrooms, and the funky alien looking shrooms in this dish are cool. And tasty.
Lots of veggies in this one too, and it's spicy (don't chomp on the small red peppers)
which I love.
Oh, and they have your order ready so fast you'll think they saw you coming and could read your mind...."}

So if you go, you may want to tell them to go lightly on the salt unless you really, really like salty food."}

Got a to-go order and placed it over the phone. I had ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta along with a side garden salad. Long story short, I got home and had high hopes for the pasta, but it unfortunately fell short. The cheese topping was definitely shredded/grated cheese (the same one that's on salads, I believe it was cheddar cheese). Also the food was already cold when I took it back which was disappointing! Overall I felt like I was eating one of those microwavable pasta dinners and was disappointed.

For the price (Paid around $14~, can't remember), I definitely expected better. I wish I could give a higher rating for this place since I've seen reviews complimenting their service and food, so I'm not sure if I just picked up an order on an off day."}

They're only open until 8 which is kind of a bummer but personally I feel like it's all worth while.  No grumpy workers, food is on point, clean environment.  That's a win win for me! Their deserts are made daily and constantly changes and so do the specials, I've never tried the specials but the desserts are super yummy! I think the reason I enjoyed this place so much was because it had a small town diner feel to it, and it was super nice to experience that right down the street.

We ate in so we were served. I had a lunch special so it was served in a plate lunch box (which I was fine w/ as usually I don't eat all my food in restaurants anyway. It would already be set to pack up & take hm if I didn't finish). Anyhow, I ordered fried rice, chow mein, sweet sour pork (which I'm so picky w/ because it's one of my fav Chinese dishes, & it also came w/ a soup. I believe it was miso soup but don't quote me on that. They also give a tray of what looked like wonton chips appetizers which you dip in sweet sour sauce. A bit too greasy but my little one loved it! =) All this for about $12 or so. I did buy a fountain drink of course. Not too bad for the amount of food we were served. Back to the sweet sour pork, absolutely delish! Not too hard & not too greasy. & most of all... Not super drenched in sweet sour sauce. I hate it when the crispy batter around the meat is soggy before I even get to eat it. This was perfect! Way better than what pandas serve anyway. Chow mein & fried rice was great as well. Tasteful. The guys working were super nice. The place was clean. No funky smells. Haha! Definitely gonna eat here again. Hopefully soon when i get the chance. This ones a keeper for me!"}

The food was disgusting, covered in a half coagulated brown gravy, and vegetables that were just thrown on the plate in disarray! Our server didn't know whether she was coming or going.
I'm sorry but we will NEVER return to this diner or any of the other metro diners in Vegas! Food tasted terrible!!!!!"}

I believe it's the owner's son who serves me every time, he is just a disaster. He never knows what to say or do, and if I ask for something to be taken out or substituted, the answer is always no, and they never listen to anything I ask for in terms of my food. I'll say, "no thank you, I do not want any soup today, its too hot outside..." He brings the soup anyway. I'll ask "can I have one egg roll on the side instead of soup?" He responds no. I'll ask if I can get half and half two different entrees in my to-go order, he responds no. Just not the type of kid you should have running a restaurant, its sad!"}

It's definitely not gourmet Chinese food by any means, it's a good place to fill you up on a budget. In addition, they have a good family meal option for a fair price, which is nice if you have kids (and you have several options for the dinner, and they are not stingy on the choices).

The chicken and broccoli, salt and pepper shrimp, the war wonton soup, and the orange chicken are very good. I especially like the crab rangoons, and the fried dumplings. If you are looking for a fast and friendly place for Chinese food, on a budget, look no further!"}

I had a fountain diet Coke ($1.50) which was refilled 3 times and my bill was $12.20.  The place was clean, I was waited on immediately and was impressed with the food and saw many orders to go that impressed me with the large portions they served.  I highly recommend this place and would have given it 5 stars if the people serving me had smiles on their faces.

We've had delivery on small or large orders & we always receive it right away. So basically your turn around time for delivery is not a long wait at all. 

Dining inside was actually pretty nice for a take out place. It's clean, they're just as friendly in person as they are on the phone & they always come by to make sure you have all you need including refilling your drinks.. I know of several restaurants that are bigger & your server disappears. 

Food is made to order, flavorful & nice portions! I recommend this place if you want to go out for a low key evening or if you need a night off of cooking, order family size items. Prices aren't bad at all either."}

I love those, but they have no clue how to prepare them.  It should be ham, turkey, swiss on bread that is egg dipped and deep fried then sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Side for added flavor is either maple syrup or a sweet jelly/jam such as strawberry.  Well,  they got the ham, turkey and cheese ok (but not much of it) and the bread was like almost a whole loaf!  It was deep fried but you though you were eating slightly flavored bread.  They provided some sort of a berry "dip" to spread but overall it couldn't hold a candle to New York Deli (that burned down 10 years ago) or the Pine Tree Restaurant of Spring Mountain that CLOSED two years ago.  Short version... there's no where in Southern Nevada that knows how to make a Monte Cristo.

Part two...my wife had the bar-b-que sandwich which was ok BUT...they provided their version of a bar-b-que sauce that was the color, consistency and FLAVOR of catsup with a little bit of pickle in it.  She ate the sandwich but the sauce was a waste of time.

Service was very good but that's all this place had going for it.  

Our one, and only, trip there."}

Over all, I will order again. I would say it's good step up from Panda Express. 

China Tango is not to be rated against a nice sit down authentic Chinese restaurant. 

PS: my order came with two containers of white rice free, I normally order brown rice if offered but I didn't see the option to choose, and honestly I didn't know I'd even be getting rice so no biggie. :) 

PSS: This place is FAR FAR FAR better than the Chinese delivery (I won't name names) in the Sprouts/Target center at Green Valley & Horizon Ridge."}

I had to salt pepper and add much hot sauce to give this any flavor at all. I'm going to give it at 3 because it wasn't bad it just wasn't good.

I'm not sure if this was the usual playlist, nor am I going to deduct stars, but it was definitely a surprise for my first visit.

In any event, this is a casual Chinese restaurant in the mold of China A Go Go. I ordered the Hong Kong style chow mein, which is my usual order when eating at a new Chinese restaurant. Food came out quickly and piping hot. They didn't skimp on the chicken, beef, or shrimp, which made it a good value. I don't live on this side of town, but it is close to the church I attend, so if I'm craving Chinese food on a Sunday afternoon after mass, I know where to go."}

First visit was during lunch with the coworkers - arrived 20 minutes before noon and was seated right away. I swear as soon as 12pm hit, it became super busy - all tables were filled!
The staff were very friendly and had bubbly personalities!
I ordered the 'Fried Chicken Plate', includes half a chicken - fried, mashed potatoes with gravy, grilled veggies and a biscuit. Dinner item for lunch, I know weird, but before ordering we kept seeing the chicken pass by and didn't want so much of the breakfast/lunch food, so that was the best bet. Definitely did not disappoint - chicken was super crispy and moist, mashed potatoes were buttery good, the grilled veggies were simple but nothing beats that grilled, charred taste, and those biscuits made from scratch daily, ughh *drool*! Also, had a side of onion rings. 

Second visit was during dinner with family, it was SUPER packed! Informed a 15-20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. Staff was still very friendly though!
I decided to try the 'Chicken and Waffles with the Strawberry Butter'.
I know I went opposite this time -- breakfast for dinner, lol!
Chicken this time around was a bit salty. The waffles were perfectly crisp and that strawberry butter is amazing! Such a unique concoction! 
Mom got the steak and eggs. TBH, we've had better - so this was just "ok" in our books. Stepdad got chicken fingers with fries. Brother got 'Bold City Burger', which has cheese, onions, bacon, sausage, jalapeños, lettuce, tomato on a brioche bun - this was soooo good!
ALOT to take in (literally) but the toasted bun with all the ingredients together takes this burger to the next level! A MUST TRY!

Very pleased with both visits and like I've mentioned before, I LOVE comfort type of foods! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}

I was happy to see that this location opened up because it is closer to me than the other two locations in town.

Overall, the food was good with the exception of the fish and chips which were HORRIBLE. Small, thin, sad little pieces of fish with a weird texture. And the tartar sauce was just glorified relish. I couldn't bring myself to finish the dish.

We were seated promptly upon entering, but after that, the service was pretty terrible. One guy noticed we had been waiting awhile and announced that he wasn't actually our server, but would get us drinks. Ruby was our server and only came by our table to take our order and to take the bill. The first guy and bus boy checked on us more than she did. Plus she left me with the IPad after I paid instead of waiting the five seconds to wait for me to just sign and be done with it. Felt weird to be left with such important equipment. I also waited a good portion of time for her to bring the receipt, but it wasn't until I got fed up and started to walk out that she scurried over to our table and handed my mother the receipt.

I will give them 2 stars because the rest of the staff was AMAZING! People got the door for us and even though this first guy wasn't our server, he went out of his way to help us out.

I know this diner is new and they are still probably trying to figure things out, but I feel disappointed considering it has rave reviews from everyone else. I feel jipped."}

I had asked as I often do for extra hot oil and other sauces and was so pleased to receive for the first time a nice selection and quantity of sauces including my favorite, hot oil.

No problem with that. My husband ordered the Cajun pasta in which he loved , really tasty. I ordered the meatloaf w/ mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were really good and freshly made. The meatloaf was spongy as if it had too much breading in it and salty. The service was different as many people came to our table. Overall good"}

Hubby had the special, a cheeseburger Benedict and said it was really really good. Kids had yogurt with berries and granola and the portions were huge. And finally a side of cheesy grits with butter that were amazing! All the kids said eer have to come here more often. Think this will be replacing black bear for us.

Metro is on their game with efficiently serving up good food. We've never had to wait long for a table and the food is quick to arrive at the table. The front of the restaurant has a comfortable waiting area for busy times. The servers have been friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant has an old school diner feel, but cleaner and more open.

I've enjoyed a Crab Cake Benedict and Sausage Gravy & Biscuits. Both were delicious and came out as generous portions. The hash browns on the side were tasty too. My orders have been correct and well prepared both times. Next time I'll have to try the signature Chicken & Waffles!"}

This is a typical fast food Chinese place, over salted meals and quick service, but  sometimes you just gotta succumb to the call of MSG. I actually thought this place was pretty good, although not something I would eat everyday. 

I sat and was immediately greeted with water and fried wonton shells and a sweetened dipping sauce. These were a nice little touch for a dine-in fast food place, especially since I was starving! I ordered the Crab Rangoon, which is a fried wonton with cream cheese and crab meat inside. These pretty much tasted like fried cream cheese and there was barely any crab meat inside. The little crab meat I did find I'm pretty sure was from a can. Not my favorite.

After I snacked on Crab Rangoon the main course arrived. Ma Po Tofu with Pork and I swapped out the rice for Chow Mein noodles. This dish was huge!  It had mounds of noodles and a full plate of spicy tofu and pork. This was a lot better than I thought it might be especially after the "Crab Rangooning" that happened moments earlier. The tofu was cooked prefect and melted in my mouth, pork was very flavorful, but I wish it was cut into bigger chunks instead of minced pieces. Still very good and very spicy! 

The Chow Mein substitute was a good call. These were a perfect compliment to the spicy tofu/pork plate. They were soft and seasoned perfectly, I could have eaten a plate of these noodles by themselves.  China Tango is great spot for a quick bite, but I wouldn't frequent it unless I wanted to go into a sodium induced coma."}

This place serves fresh food that isnt greasy or overly salty. The vegetables are still green and crunchy, not soggy and wilted. Meat is good quality. You know those weird, gooey, unidentifiable chicken pieces you sometimes get in Chinese food? None of that here. The flavors are spot on. My favorites include the moo goo chicken, singapore noodles, and shrimp with broccoli. Large portions that arent drowning in salty sauces. Yay!"}

I mean it was okay but not that great . In Utah there's a place called the Italian place that is a hundred times better and you can get a huge sandwich for $10 and share it and not have to tip a server. I got the pastrami sandwich that had an egg on it and cheese and coleslaw. I didn't realize that it had Fry's on it too. I'm sorry but it just wasn't very good .  The bread was not toasted at all. It was these big slices of bread with all this stuff on it so it was really hard to eat. The Fry's that were on the sandwich were squished soggy and cold. The egg on the sandwich was cold . It did lot of meat on it though, but it has this really strong flavor like it it's been brining forever. I didn't get any mustard for the pastrami and the waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted any. Who eats pastrami without mustard ? Then my husband realized that he's lost his wallet and we had to leave. The waitress brought us our containers to put our food in and then I went up front because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to wait for her to get my credit card. She finally came up there and ran my card then left me standing there with the paperwork that I had signed and I had to wait for someone to come back up there to get it. So I tipped her $1 less then I was going to. I mean if she is going to leave me standing there when she knew I had an emergency then tough luck your not getting much of a tip from me. Seriously people if Guy Fieri's going to endorse your restaurant and live up to it!"}

We were greeted promptly by our server who was super friendly and energetic. 

I settled on a breakfast burrito. When it came out I was overwhelmed by the size of it. As I dug in I quickly realized it was a classic example of quantity over quality. The burrito was covered with salsa which made it soggy on the bottom. I found that the egg whites inside were a little bland and needed salt. The burrito was filled with egg whites, green peppers, and black olives.

Hmm..mind you, it's barely 4pm and there is only one other occupied table in the restaurant! For 15 minutes, I watched our server bus empty tables and stand around looking into space.  There were also FOUR other servers standing around not doing anything with their side chit chat. Wow! I can understand the wait if it's busy, but this kind of service is unacceptable.  I have worked in customer service related industries for years and I have never walked out of a restaurant in my life! As we walked out, a sarcastic server said, "thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed your meal!" Let's just say I will NOT be coming here again."}

My husband teasingly jokes about us visiting diners all over the world, Henderson.NV to Paris.FR . Metro Diner, Henderson, NV -Stephanie Road will be added to my favorite list.

A friendly welcome relief of delicious food and drink, for a solo business traveler seeking comfort.  Plus a great slow atmosphere before speeding into the rest of your day.

Interior photos to be added later.
A very unassuming exterior, with delicious delightful food inside.  Similar to the warm and friendly feeling, I've always experienced in Southern USA. (Southern Cuisine)

Something for every palate: Organic choice teas, No-Carb option (egg & turkey sausage), crab egg hollandaise, to sinfully tasty looking waffles & pink ice cream. (didn't try-looked absolutely delicious).

Diner service from host/hostess, waitress, visiting regional manager, and the amazing COOK was phenomenal.  Just what the doctor ordered after the awful tasteless, and high priced Westin Lake Las Vegas.NV buffet breakfast the morning before.

A new customer for LIFE.  Can't wait to bring my husband here for good eats.

Much appreciation!  Metro Diner, Henderson.NV Stephanie Rd."}

I ordered take-out shrimp chop suey, which came with chow mein and fried rice. The total was about $7 bucks-ish. Remember, they don't give you condiments unless you ask, so don't forget! 

The shrimp chop suey was decent and flavorful. There were plenty of vegetables, which was delicious. The shrimp was bit tough, which was my only complaint for this dish. The chow mein noodles and fried rice were very bland. I wasn't too crazy about it.

When I walked in to grab the food, the service wasn't all that great. Not personable.  Overall, if you're looking for a quick bite that is cheap and fast, then don't hesitate to give this place a shot!"}

Located close to home, China Tango is on the corner of N Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. I've been meaning to write them a review for some time, so here it is. Whether I've dined in, gotten delivery or carry-out (I've done all three numerous times!) I haven't been disappointed with their food, service, and overall experience. It's been my go-to spot for fast, affordable Chinese food.

What I love:

- No MSG. Enough said.
- They offer brown rice. Healthy!
- Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers.
- Lunch specials are till 4pm. Who can always fit lunch before 2pm?
- Lots of vegetables. Crispy veggies too, not the gross wilted ones you get at other places.

They have all the traditional orders, from chow mein, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, fried rice, hot & sour soup, it goes on and on. Prices range from $7.25-$9.95. Lunch is from $5.95-$6.50, which includes fried or steamed rice & chow mein & egg drop soup (dine-in only). Complete family dinners start from $24.95 & they serve Thai tea or fruit smoothies with boba.

Most importantly, they've always been timely. Food is served fast, carry-out is ready, and delivery is always punctual. 

Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)"}

I noticed China Tango had four stars on here, so I gave it a try. I placed an online order and my food arrived 25 minutes later. It was so fast that when my doorbell rang, I was shocked and even asked "who is it?" because I didn't think it could be my dinner lol. The delivery guy was very nice and prepared with a pen and receipt. 

I ordered the dinner for one so I could get a little variety to try. It comes with an entree, rice or noodles, soup, and a small appetizer. I chose general tso's chicken, fried rice, and crab rangoon. (I'm not a big soup fan) the Rangoon didn't come with the usual red sauce, which was a let down. Everything else was pretty good for the price. Keep in mind, this is fast food Chinese! The fact that they delivery, aren't expensive, and food was pretty good, they get three stars. I would give it 3.5 if I could."}

I ended up ordering the stuffing waffle which is basically a waffle made from stuffing that is topped with mashed potatoes and turkey with brown gravy. I decided to order this since it is currently one of their specials. The waffle itself was pretty good in terms of flavor because I was actually able to taste the stuffing. I loved how crispy the waffle was, but unfortunately half of the waffle ended up being soggy because of the moisture and heat from being covered by the mashed potatoes and turkey. I think the dish would have been better if everything was plated separately instead of on a stack. The portion is pretty big and I'd say it's enough for two people. The turkey was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor. I wish I had more gravy for my mashed potatoes because all of the gravy just ended up on the turkey itself. No one likes eating mashed potatoes without gravy right? 

Overall the food was decent, but the service was pretty good. The waiter was very personable and kept an eye on our table. I'd probably come back here and try some of their other dishes."}

I've always enjoyed the food at Metro. This was my first time to this location, the staff was very friendly.  This was also my first time ordering the steak philly, which I do not recommend.  First the positive, the bun is soft and yummy.  Now the ick, the meat was burnt and lacked flavor.  Also, I have a mushroom allergy and after eating almost half the sandwich, the last couple bites tasted strange so I opened it to notice mushrooms.  I had to get my check and leave so I could take some meds.  The fries were really salty and seemed old, I'd say the pickle had less salt lol. 

I will return to Metro, not this location and never will I order this sandwich.  

I would highly recommend if you want a perfect philly, go to Peppermill, it's worth the drive."}

It has been open approximately a year (used to dine here when it was Pick Up Stix).
  The atmosphere is more restaurant than take out. There is more of a wait person presence.
   Before you order your food, they bring you egg drop soup. I hope it is included with all dine in meals. Not too much later, they bring crunchy noodles with duck sauce. If you order soda, they will fill it at the fountain for you. Last but not least, they will deliver your entree with the included fried rice and chow mein noodles.
  The lunch special tops off at $6.50. Soda is not included. The bill for the lunch special with a soda totals up to close to $10 before the tip (a tip jar).
   I rate China Tango four stars. The quality, starting from the crunchy noodles to the fortune cookie is high.
  A word of advice: Look at the menu outside. Once your inside, they'll sit you down, and before you know it they'll be serving you egg drop soup. This could make some people, myself included, feel awkward if there is nothing here that suits your taste."}

They seem to know what they're talking about. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and sat immediately at the counter. The counter seats look directly into the kitchen, and I really liked that I could watch the food being cooked and listen to the interactions between the servers and the kitchen staff. The kitchen staff even greeted me and interacted with me throughout my visit there, which I personally enjoy because it really makes me feel welcome. Service and comfort are the biggest things to me when it comes to rating and reviews, and this place nailed both categories.

The food was just as good! I had the challa french toast breakfast special, which came with eggs, bacon, has browns, french toast, and an English muffin. If I had eaten anything at all today, I would probably not have been able to finish it all. The French toast was delicious and the fruit on top of it added some good sweetness and tart to balance it out (bananas and strawberries). The bacon was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right. The hash browns were well done and a little too crispy for me, but this being my first time it was a learning experience. I'm sure if I ordered them differently they would have nailed it. Absolutely wonderful.

Overall, between the great service, friendly interactions, and delicious food, this place got an easy 5 star from me. I'll be back for sure and it will be an easy recommendation to make for friends/family looking for a good breakfast here in henderson."}

From the many pics of past customers who also ordered this from China Tango, the pictures looked promising... 

I called in my take out order and within 15 minutes I arrived to pick it up. China Tango is located in the Smith's shopping center a few doors down from Rubio's. There's a decent amount of parking directly in the front. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side with about 8 tables inside. Customer service is decent. 

So let's talk food: 

1) Honey Walnut Shrimp- I would give this 3.5 stars. The shrimps weren't as crispy as I like. This may be because I didn't dig into them right away. Might give them another try. Too much sauce was also found on the shrimp. Oh and this is expensive, $11.99 for this dish. 

2) Mongolian Beef- xxxspicy! This was also just okay for me. Too much sauce, wasn't spicy at all and there were noodles with this? Weird. The meat was slithery. Man, I really wished this was good. 

All in all, I don't think this will be my go to Chinese restaurant- still on the look out for my go to. Recommendations are always welcome!"}

At first I could tell that this was a mostly breakfast-oriented restaurant judging by the quality of breakfast food compared to dinner food. I would be rating this place 4 stars out of 5 because of that slight disparity, but they really stepped up their game with their dinner menu over time."}

Hosts were nice and it was a short wait to get seated as it didn't look like they were too busy (Sunday afternoon). 

After being seated we had to wait an extremely long time (~10 mins) before we were greeted by a server. Guy was very nice, took our drinks, and let us know that our actual server will check on us soon. During this wait we overheard the table next to us asking for a manager to complain about the service. Honestly, this should have been our first red flag. After waiting ANOTHER 5-10 mins our actual server showed up and took our orders. She didn't know how to work the ordering tool that well which was strange (Place just opened. Didn't you get trained?).

For the drinks, I tried the sweetened peach tea and it was super (extremely) sweet. Mixed it half and half with wife's water and it was still a bit too sweet but very tasty.

For the food, I got the Monte Cristo with chips which was excellent in taste and portion. The berry sauce it came with was equally amazing. I would recommend that dish if you're going to come here. 

The wife got the fish and chips which were terrible. I thought she was exaggerating so I tried some but they really were awful. The fish were soggy on the outside instead of crispy, they were totally bland and the tater sauce tasted more like relish in a cup. Would not recommend that dish to anyone. My wife just ended up having part of my Monte Cristo and left almost the entirety of the fish and chips. 

Mother-in-law got the bacon mushroom swiss burger with fries. She said the burger was extremely good but the fries were already cold when they reached the table. Brother-in-law got the bold city burger which he said was excellent (and looked excellent) but same issue with the fries.

During the meal we were checked up on by a few people, none of which were our server. Unfortunately no one refilled waters or sodas even once during the meal. The original person who took our drinks left the check for us which is weird (where is our server?). After finishing we waited another 5 minutes after the bus boy took our plates before the server sort of stumbled passed our table, noticed we were done, and asked us if we wanted a box for the fish and chips and took our payment.

In the end, this was a disappointing experience. The burgers and sandwiches may be good but a lot of work needs to be done with the service and I don't know how they could possibly fix the disgrace that they call their fish and chips.

Tl;Dr Service was bad. Burgers and sandwiches were good and the only thing that saved the meal. Fish and chips were a disgrace."}

We wanted a quick easy bite for breakfast after a long week where I had been ill for a few days. We had tried the one in the southwest part of Vegas and since this is now in walking distance if the need arises to actually walk some where. We arrived and were seated Immediately. Are waiter was really great, I forget his name, but he also works at Black Bear Diner so he was a familiar face. I had simple Sausage and egg breakfast with a side of B & G. Josie had Pancake Breakfast. The order came quickly and we enjoyed our meal. I will have to say the meals are not really stunning as Diner food goes. However, you get a great meal that fills the plate and your stomach. The staff is friendly and the wait for anything is minimal. Price wise it is on average with any diner in Vegas.
Thank you for Dining at Metro Diner. We will definitely return here. We would like to try lunch or dinner as well. It is quick and easy to get to and food is good. If in Henderson and you would like a great meal, check them out you will not be disappointed."}

Honestly, it's just a step up from Denny's. Their menu items offered here is better, ambiance is nicer, but that's just about it.

Came here couple times over the past few months, hoping I'd find something I can be excited about and tried different dishes each time. Nothing memorable to me, well, except pass on the grits here, the texture and taste are off. trust me.

Mr B loves their Monte Cristo. I had liked it too. But that last visit, it was heavy on the grease. The jam that it's served with was good too. I assumed it was made from scratch from what I read. But when I asked our server for more, she looked and pointed to the packaged jellies on our table and said just open those, they're the same thing. Okaay.

Service is friendly. Nothing more or less. It was on point when the servers had their trainers hovering over them. Last two visits, got seated right away, but it took more than five minutes for a server to acknowledge our existence. Plus they were forgetful. 

And whoever was the lead giving their employees evaluations, should use a little more discretion. Like do not do the employee evals at the boothes with patrons within earshot. Real tacky.  Employee got rated 3 cause she "needs to smile more"... which may be true, but how about how unprofessional evaluator was? I didn't need to hear that. 

Metro Diner still on the list to visit, just not as enthusiastic as others are."}

Me and my girlfriend ate here twice while visiting my grandparents at the end of September, it was great service and great food, 4 or 5 stars is what they rated based off of the regular diner experience but what really impressed me was the kindness they showed in the wake of one of the most tragic nights of our lives. My girlfriend and I were trapped inside the route 91 harvest festival the night of the shooting, we endured a horrifying ordeal while escaping the venue that night, we hardly slept when we arrived at my grandparents house that night but as the dust settled the next day my grandparents took us here for breakfast. I ate maybe 3 bites of my food, my girlfriend maybe double that, through the course of normal waitress conversation and the fact this was world news and we were in the town next to it only 12 hours later the waitress found out what happened, she talked to her manager, she talked to the regional manager I believe it was who just happened to be stopping by. They paid for all of our meals and extended their thoughts to us in this terrible time, they didn't have to do any of that but they did, that's a company that is run by real people unlike many others nowadays. The Polaroid at the bottom of the collage is all of us on our first visit that weekend before the shooting."}

I ordered one of their blackboard specials, a stuffing waffle covered in mashed potatoes, turkey, and gravy. It was really good and humongous. My wife had the Monte cristo, which was deep fried and delicious. 

I don't think I've been to a restaurant with such happy and nice staff before. They were all going over the top to make sure we were doing well. It was almost a little too much for my taste, but I can't fault them for that.  

It's a solid place. You can tell they care. The menu is inventive. I would definitely go back.

Everything tasted SO GOOD. I wasn't sure what quality the food would be but it was far and above any other 'diner' I've been to. I took the bananas out of the Yohala and it was perfect. My husband said his meal was better than Roscoe's.

Initially I had opted for delivery but since we lived beyond their 5 mile radius, I had to pick the order up. The food was ready when I arrived. I quickly surveyed the small restaurant and it did look very clean. We all thought that what we ordered tasted ok...not over the top. I'm a big fan of honey walnut shrimp but the way they prepared their version was different than what I'm used to. Most places I've been to have used a mayo glaze but at China Tango they use a mustard like glaze? The wonton soup was tasty.  Should I return, I'll dine at the restaurant and I'd like to give their chow fun or chow mein a try."}

The food is hot and fresh and I practically never have to wait if I order ahead of time. Their spicy level is just right for me. Just enough heat, but not too much where you can't taste the rest of your food. I order the crab Rangoon, General Tso chicken ( in spicy), eggplant tofu stir fry, salt and pepper chicken ( in spicy ). It comes with a side of white rice, so there is plenty of food for 2 and for seconds as well! Highly recommend."}

Really liked the feel of the place, staff was friendly and lots of comfortable seating. The menu is extremely accommodating for whatever you're in the mood for & breakfast is always available. Our server was helpful and we both picked the same entree in spite of all the choices. So...San Fran Eggs Benedict for both of us and I removed the Canadian bacon cause I wasn't paying attention or I would have asked for spinach instead. Asked for my eggs to be poached to a medium so the whites are done and they got that just right. They were good but we both thought the soggy English muffins were a bit of a bummer. Missed the crunchy texture because the eggs, tomato and avocado all soft, needed to be crisp muffin. Hash browns were crispy although a tad oily for me. All in all we both cleaned our plates and are looking forward to coming back and trying some other lunchie choices. Great place!"}

Of course no one could be like Thai BBQ but my mom and I needed our fix so bad! Last week we took out all the takeout menus and sat down and decided who we would order from and we picked China Tango!

I loved my whole meal except one dish! Really those are good odds LOL!
We ordered delivery and food came so fast and was still piping hot! Hot as in we didn't even need to microwave it at ALL! 

-Pad Thai
I was very disappointed by this dish, first off, the noodles were much thicker and they were bright orange! No peanuts or bean sprouts :/ The taste was just OK it wasn't that true pad thai I've had before :/

-Crab Rangoons
DELICIOUS! I've never had such a good amount of filling in my rangoons! Most places really skimp on the filing! They tasted so fresh and didn't feel like they were frozen!

-Potsticker
Not as good as the rangoons but still tasty!

-Steamed Vegetables
This was the winner! I really enjoyed the vegetables, they were tasty! Everything I ate didn't taste frozen or if it was sitting out! My mom and I could have ordered 2 of those!

-Chicken Fried Rice
This was just as good, just needed a bit of soy sauce!

Total: $39.00 (including delivery fee) Our food was solid, didn't taste like your typical greasy Chinese food! LOL

This is definitely going to be in our rotation of take out and would try other items!

Two friends and I had breakfast/lunch here today and can't rave  enough about both the food and the service.
Janice had a southern omelette that comes  with toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries.
Colleen had crispy bacon,  eggs and crispy hashbrowns that were absolute perfection. I opted for the meatloaf dinner that comes with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. The meatloaf,  along with the fried chicken and waffles are their most requested dinners and I can see why. Everyone of us absolutely loved the food....fresh, hot and perfectly done.  The only downside: the coffee could be a little richer with a little more body, but that's how we saw it.

The service is professionally served by people who know what they're doing.Be sure  to ask for Leah or Darlene, both outstanding servers. 
If you haven't been here yet,  be sure to try METRO DINER. The restaurant was crowded on Sunday as it should be; an indication that they're doing something right."}

I cannot speak for items other than the orange chicken, all the sides/appetizers, and the soups. So if you're a person that likes honey walnut shrimp, I can't say I would ever have it and if it's good or not.

I'm super picky on my Chinese because I often get super sick when I have it, I never have that problem here.

This is an EXTREMELY good lunch spot or typical chinese food takeout. If you're looking for a fancy place that you can instagram this isn't it, I think the $15 bill for 2 people is a good indicator that this isn't that type of place."}

They have quite a large selection to choose from and bless their heart and my taste buds, they serve breakfast and lunch items all day.

First off, the place is always clean. The guy handling the money doesn't handle the food and vice versa. I never have to worry about looking for the table with the least amount if food left on it from previous guests, because the staff keep them clean.  

The staff there are very kind and are patient as i always want to try something different so I may take a few minutes to figure out what I want or if I actually want it. The same people are always there and the guy at the front knows what my co worker is going to order when we get there. If you dine in you get bottomless fried wonton noodles which are so good! They are also very quick; when you order, the food is out in less than ten minutes. 

Rice is a big thing with me as I feel it can make a meal taste great or make you want to throw it in the garbage, but can't cause that's a waste. The rice, both fried and steamed is very tasty and not dry which is one thing I hate about rice at other restaurants. Also the rice isn't mushy. I usually get sautéed vegetables and I don't want my meal to end. The vegetables are so fresh and crunchy and the sauce they use is so magnificent I love it! Their chow mien also tastes great and I'm not too much of a chow mien person.   

Lunch specials are very inexpensive and are reasonably portioned. I almost always have left overs. The time for the linch specials goes till 4p, so if you go close to that time, you can have dinner too!

Overall, I choose this place over any other Chinese place in the area and I've been to almost all of them. Can't beat the cleanliness, service, prices and of course the food!"}

Both of our meals were on plates too small for the amount of food offered. It made the plate look crowded and a bit unappetizing. My chicken came with potatoes, veggies and a biscuit. The chicken was well cooked, potatoes were good and the biscuit was ON POINT. The veggies we're swimming in grease/oil and completely inedible.

Best I have ever had! Lunch specials are $6-8 and large portions. Servers are sweet. Its a cozy, clean, and open environment. only downside is if it is lunch time and you dont get the specials...food takes about 20 minutes and tastes old. Family business. Lunch time is quiet with only one or two couples rotating in and out. Dinner time has more couples and small families, always a table ready quickly though."}

We tried a nearby place that sounded great but the wait was ridiculous. The reviews for this place looked positive and it was close so we decided to give it a try. Walking in, it just smelled amazing. A positive right off the bat. There was no wait which was another plus even though the place seemed pretty busy. We were seated quickly and our waiter Andy greeted us quickly with water already in hand. We ordered and our food was quick to come out. It was delicious. The portions were huge and it tasted great. Andy was efficient and nice which made the experience as a whole very nice. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place for breakfast. And another plus, they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day! Give this place a try!"}

This location did not cease to impress or live up to their standards.

We went there couple of days for lunch. It was a Friday afternoon around 230 and it seems their lunch crowd had just left and their dinner rush had not yet begun. This location had the same warm inviting feel as the other locations. Very organized and very clean and definitely living up to the standards.

I went ahead and started off with the mango iced tea that was suggested. Perfectly sweet and refreshing for a warm day. My friend had the orange juice. Definitely not fresh squeezed but pretty good.

I want to head with the daily special and had the shrimp po boy. The whole sandwich was a hit from start to finish. Perfectly golden fried shrimp tossed in a spicy mayo. Fresh tomatoes and green onions on a perfectly fresh roll. Served with fries. For $12 this is a sure hit. Shrimp were fried perfectly and not greasy at all. Loved the chipotles ranch sauce that comes with it. Gave it a solid 5/5

My friend had the vegetable omelette without the cheese. Fresh vegetable medley filled this golden fluffy omelette. Served with Home style potatoes. Everything went well together. The potatoes were "rejuvenated". More than likely prepared early in the day and then heated. Way to dark and greasy but everything else was great.

Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner. Staff was friendly. Definitely a step above any regular coffee shop."}

I got the Ruben, which is my standard by which I judge places. The wife got the Monte Cristo and my daughter the Fruity Waffle. The proportions were good, although the waffle was just a Belgium waffle with a little fruit. She got a side of bacon making it the most expensive dish at the table. She said it was strangely dry inside and our waffles at home are better. The Monte Cristo was huge, but the batter was very thick and grease would run down her hand when she bit into it. My Reuben had a good amount of corned beef. I had mentioned that the photos on Yelp varied greatly as to the amount of meat. The waitress confirmed that it does vary a lot. I asked for the fuller version. The corned beef was good, but the sandwich as a whole was kinda strange. First of all it was very juicy for a sandwich. Juice (juice, grease, sauce?) would run down my chin when I bit into it. Usually you can easily identify the cheese, sauerkraut and sauce but in this I couldn't. It seemed like it was all one thing. It was also really strong and overpowered the meat. Very messy to eat. We went away very disappointed."}

It used to be the lines were out the door, at least a 20-30 minute wait.  Once inside and seated, the kitchen was bustling, service staff was all over, customers were all taking and the place was ELECTRIC! Now, none of the above applies. Kitchen, quiet, and the food is sub par; a FAR cry from what it was, and that's amazing considering there isn't much of a wait anymore and the kitchen cooked a lot better when it was busy!  Today, my "special" country fried steak breakfast was flat out BURNT and they tried to conceal that by putting the worst side down and hiding the rest of it under gravy. Problem is, burnt is burnt and you discover that when you first cut into the damn thing! It was SO bad, my server saw it and without even saying a word( she was totally embarrassed, so it's not like she was trying to be rude) she took it away to show management and the kitchen.  Problem is NO ONE from management came over to the table, NO ONE!!!! If they had, they'd have also discovered the hash browns were equally as offensive; SCORCHED!! Every since this "Lynn" became a manager at this location the place seems to have fallen apart, from the hostess station and hostesses and the kitchen.  We love the server crew, ALL of them are wonderful (shout out to Ida, Kyle and April, all of whom are top notch and apologies to the others we haven't had the pleasure of meeting) and you can see they bust their butts to make up for things. But folks, the experience starts at the hostess station and ends with the kitchen, and when 2 of the 3 fundamentals of making and keeping a great restaurant are as jacked up as this one is, it's over!  The writing is on the wall in this place, and it's fixable. Question is, will they?!  I was HIGHLY put off that this manager was talking to the next table about the fish and chips when I ate NOTHING and not so much as an apology or "is there something else we can get you instead"!  You may very well have lost my families business and we have been coming here at LEAST once a week for over a year and are HEAVY tippers!  There have been several other incidents in the past  I haven't mentioned, but like a bad marriage, you can love it, but there comes a time when you gotta leave it and move on."}

That is exactly what you get here. Two tone glass globes for the ceiling lights. Chromed stools at the counter. Purse hooks beneath the counter. A black and white check tile floor. Diner favorites such as fried chicken, meatloaf, pot pie and burgers. Even some oldies (late 60s and maybe early 70s) playing on the PA. The only thing not part of the throw back feel of Metro Diner is the tablet device the wait staff record your order on; which, to quote the waitress, "is the worst invention." I tend to agree.

Any how, I ordered what is in my mind a trifecta burger. That is to say a bacon, mushroom and swiss burger. I ordered it cooked to medium and it came out as such. The juicy beef tasted fresh. The cheese was melted perfect and gooey. The three slices of bacon were thick cut and came perfectly crisp. The mushrooms were fresh and shroomy. The rest of the toppings were simply shredded lettuce and one slice of tomato. Really it was just a generic burger. But there is nothing wrong with a generic burger if it is done right. The fries on the side were fries. Thick cut and natural with skins on.

Usually I would stop with the burger and fries. But the entire time I was waiting for my food and eating I could not help but stare at the chalk board on the far side of the restaurant. One dessert written on the board was taunting me. Bananas foster cheesecake. Um, yes please. So I ordered dessert today. It was good but not as good as I had hoped it would be. Basically it was a cheese cake with bananas in it. It was like eating banana pudding with the texture of cheesecake. It would have been nice if it reflected a true bananas foster more with a booze flavor. Regardless, it was a good dessert.

The diner was about half full today. Fairly busy I suppose. And the entire wait staff was running around like mad serving everybody at every table. They were friendly and attentive. There is a sign above the bar that reads something along the lines of "Where the locals eat." And there were obvious locals here. The waitress knew a group that came in when I was finishing my cheesecake. She knew them by name and knew their drink orders before they even sat down. This is a good measure of quality customer service. Metro Diner may be a chain but they truly feel like a neighborhood establishment. I'm a fan."}

Decided to take my father, who was visiting from out of town, out to lunch here on a Sunday. We were seated right away, but everything else went downhill from there. We ordered a club sandwich and the fish and chips, a seemingly straightforward order. After waiting for our food and not having seen our waiter for about 25-30 minutes, my father finally was able to flag our waiter down and asked him when our food would be ready. The waiter seemed confused and said he did not see that our orders had been entered and asked us what we wanted again. After he was gone for a few minutes, he came back and informed us that the kitchen had told him our food would be out right away. We saw several tables who were seated after us receive their food. Probably after waiting another 5-10 minutes we decided it was time to go. We were getting up from the table when the waiter hurriedly delivered the club sandwich and said the fish would be out soon. We told him we would take our food to go. No way were we going to sit there for much longer. Someone, who was not our waiter, came and brought the boxed sandwich to our table and said, "Sorry about the wait." Then finally, about 40-50 minutes after we placed our order (the first time?), the boxed fish and chips came out. The waiter apologized and said that the kitchen had "burned the fish" and that was the cause for the delay. He told us there would be no charge for our lunch.

I was so embarrassed to have brought my father to this place and I would certainly feel embarrassed and angry to return to eat here. The food tasted pretty good, but the terrible service is what stood out. I'm not sure if our order was lost, never entered, or the kitchen "burned the fish" that was the cause of a 40-50 minute wait time on a club sandwich and fish and chips. Ordinarily I'm pretty forgiving of sluggish service if the place is very crowded. While the diner was busy (but no wait time at the front), this long of a wait for a club sandwich and fish and chips seems kind of excessive (especially after seeing tables seated after us being served their food and finishing their meals all in this time span). Although I appreciate our waiter saying there would be no charge, it is kind of disappointing that unhappy customers were never apologized to by a manager. Funnily enough our waiter said he hoped we would come back another time at the end of all this! Sadly, I don't think I'll return."}

China Tango is the first restaurant that I felt deserving. My husband and I have consistently ordered from China Tango for the past few months... Honestly sad to say but average 2 to 3 times a week and they have not disappointed us. We have only used the delivery service so we are only able to review that service and the food. 

Order: 
We usually order through yelp but a couple of times we ordered over the phone. Both options are pretty speedy with no complications.

Delivery: 
The best delivery service ever! They are soooo speedy. From the time we order to the food arriving at our house about 20-30 mins top. 

Service:
Exceptional! They are very speedy and thorough. China tango has NOT made a mistake on any of our orders. And that's a lot to say since it has probably been more then 25 orders. Each and every requests we have made have been carried out. This last time we asked if they could make orange shrimp (not on their menu) since I do not eat meat and without hesitation, the guy over the phone says of course. And it was AMAZING. 

FOOD THE BEST PART: 
OMG China Tango is the best chinese food that I have eaten and I've eaten Chinese food everywhere! Everything is delicious! My husband loves their general tsao chicken and orange chicken. My favorite is their salt and pepper calamari and shrimp, kung pao shrimp, and sweet and sour soup! They have the BEST sweet and sour soup and the best thing is that you can choose your spice level.

Overall, 
If you are on the fence of trying china tango, Do It!!! Exceptional service and food. What else can you ask for?"}

The menu had a lot of options and I already have some ideas for when I come back! The food was delicious! We got the fruity waffle and breakfast burger for 10 and 14 dollars.

After opening everything up at home we were shorted one if the sides of bacon.  Both of our eggs tasted so watery I have to believe they either came out of a carton or they use water to add volume to the eggs. Second the hashbrowns....not a speck of seasoning on them..the blandest potatoes I ever tasted. The larger pieces were hard in the middle. Omelet was ok...barely ok...eggs like I said were watery but the fillings were....so so...my daughter ciuldnt eat the breakfast pie....eggs were so watery..mushrooms were soggy. We gave hers to the dogs..they seemed to enjoy it. The biscuit was delicious. That was my favorite part of the meal. Maybe they cater more to dining in....I dont know. But for a $28.40 breakfast or 2 people I wont ever be back. Should have gone to sunrise cafe where i am always happy with what i get. They get the 2nd star because the lady who checked me out was a sweetheart. I was very close to bringing everything back...honestly not worth the wait or the effort."}

My Aunt, Uncle, and I arrived around 5:30PM on a Tuesday evening to a good crowd in the dining room but with no wait for a table, a plus. We were seated right next to the kitchen near the wash area which was very noisy when in use, not a deal breaker but definitely annoying. 

My family and I ordered the Minorcan Clam Chowder, Chicken Salad Salad, Blackend Chicken fingers, and a ruben. The clam chowder was very strange with a sour slightly spicy flavor (I wasn't a fan but that could be of the chowder style itself, not a reflection on Metro). My family liked their meals but I wasn't fond of the ruben. It had a strange sour flavor that wasn't from the kraut, possibly from the pastrami seasonings and they had munster cheese chunks (despite Swiss described on the menu) that weren't melted. I ate about half and threw in the towel. 

It wasn't great, but it wouldn't stop me from returning to try something different..."}

Food 4/5. Onion rings were great, big,  crispy, and unsalted. The philly cheesesteak tho... meat was good, it was hot and fresh, provolone cheese melted, grilled onions. I wasn't a fan of the pickled jalapenos. The deal breaker was the untoasted bread. Just a bit sad.

It really doesn't take much to please me when it comes to breakfast food.  Good food, large portions, great value, and superb customer service is enough to make me a repeat customer. Heck, it's enough to give an establishment 5 Stars.  I've been to all of the Metro Diner locations in Las Vegas.  A couple of things are guaranteed whenever I dine at Metro Diner

#1:  I am always going to order a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup
#2:  I am always leaving stuffed
#3:  The service is excellent

Metro Diner has a few signature items like the Chicken & Waffles, Monte Cristo, Chicken Pot Pie, Bold Burger, and Shrimp Grits.  The Chicken Pot Pie is a "must try" as well as their Chicken & Waffles.  My go-to meals at Metro Diner is their Meat Lover's Omelet and a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup.  The Meat Lover's Omelet is not on the menu, but they will create it upon request.  Metro Diner has also created a protein only breakfast for me, which consist of eggs, bacon, hamburger patty or chicken breast, and sausage.  The good stuff!!

Metro Diner is consistent when it comes to servicing their guest.  Regardless if they're jammed packed or dead slow, I have never received anything less than stellar service. 

Great Job, Metro Diner!!

TIP #1:  Hours (Sun-Thurs 7:00 AM-8:00 PM, Fri-Sat 7:00 AM-9:00 PM)
TIP #2:  Metro Diner is great about substitutions. 
TIP #3:  Daily Double.  Two visits in one day equal a 10% discount on the 2nd visit."}

When I saw that there was going to be one down the street from me, I knew that this was going to be a good. Diners are my kind of thing. Breakfast all day!/

I've had this place bookmarked ever since I found out they have chicken and waffles. I FREAKIN' LOVE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Growing up in close proximity to a Roscoe's (Long Beach, waddup!) has altered my idea of chicken and waffles for life-- let's just say that the bar is set pretty high. 

Metro Diner's chicken and waffles were top notch. I wouldn't say that they are my all time favorite, but the fried chicken was damn good. The skin was light and crispy, just the way I like it. The waffles were good. I enjoyed the strawberry butter on top, it was a nice addition to a classic combination. The server offered to make me a spicy sauce for my chicken (how am I supposed to say no to that, I love me some spicy!). She came back with a small saucer and poured in Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup. I had my doubts but wow what a great combination for the fried chicken. The chicken and waffles meal is about $15 and is a decent enough portion to share. Our table also ordered the pot roast dinner. It was a little on the salty side, but I thought it was tender and juicy and went well with the hefty portion of mashed potatoes.

Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Metro and I'll be back again. The table next to us ordered the cobbler and that was enough to convince me to come back even if it was just for dessert. The service was friendly and it really did feel like a neighborhood diner. Metro Diner is a great addition to Stephanie Street. I'll be back again for breakfast!"}

It wasn't close to home but we thought the food was yummy so a little out of the way we drove....
So I was happily surprised when driving in Green Valley one day looking for somewhere to eat - I spotted China Tango.

We each tried a lunch special which consisted of free fried wontons,egg drop soup, eggrolls,fried rice, fried noodles (chow mein) and General Tsou's Chicken & sweet N sour chicken.

Fried wontons & egg flower soup - BLEH....
Veggie Eggrolls were filled with cabbage only and the cabbage was not even soft/cooked inside so it was a weird texture.

I asked if we could have white meat chicken instead of dark meat and the server said sure. I was happy about that.... Not for long - the pieces of the chicken looked big but the actual chicken pieces were so tiny that most of the chicken pieces were just crispy breading. Disappointing!!!!

The fried rice was OK but the fried noodles were bland and yucky. I don't enjoy fried noodles when it looks like spaghetti not chow mein noodles.
The server even walked by us and said "Guess you didn't like the fried noodles..." He suggested to us that the next time we come we should just order double fried rice. I'm not too sure if they'll be a next time....

The guy behind the counter was nice and they were accommodating in reguards to the request of white chicken and if my daughter can eat her slice of pizza inside but the food just wasn't what we remembered enjoying like at the Anthem location and my fortune inside my fortune cookie was freaky- it just said "Learn Chinese"..... The BF thinks my fortune was just prepairing me for the future."}

On the way to the DMV we saw Metro Diner and of course yelped it. They received good reviews so it was our turn to try it out. The place gets really busy but we were able to be seated right away. It's very clean and has a contemporary country type of feel. Every employee we met was energetic and friendly. Kyle our server was great. The bussers and the hostesses where real top-notch. Even the owner Peter came over and was super friendly and helpful and it's good to see the owner out there helping and in the public eye. There are lots of food choices and I apologize to my vegan friends but not too many vegan choices. I had the oatmeal with bananas, home fries and rye toast with jelly. I can't say enough about the service as it really was perfect. The food portions are large which is great because who doesn't love leftovers. My son got the scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast and my wifey ordered the veggie omelet with home fries and rye toast. Now my food was great mind you would doesn't seem like it's a difficult meal but I've seen people mess up oatmeal. It was absolutely good. I then have to go with my better Parts opinion and she was very happy with the food. My son really enjoyed his food too it's kind of hard getting a real opinion out of a teenager but by the way he ate I'm guessing he really liked it. We all said we would come back here again. So Henderson Metro Diner good job! Two thumbs up very high! You also get the Boom Shaka Laka Laka Boom award 4 an overall five star experience!"}

Update! I went to the second location, and they decided to close around 2PM today. I hope I find another restaurant serving breakfast that's still open today."}

One of my friends likes to talk with huge gestures and it looked like he was waving his hand. I appreciate the waiter coming over to check on us even though we didn't ask for him to come over LOL. But that just shows they are always keeping an eye on their tables.
 
 The Excellence doesn't stop at the service. The food is just as delicious as you would expect. It's no wonder this place is packed. My friend had the pound cake French toast and I had a breakfast pie. The breakfast pie was absolutely amazing, it came with a side of hash browns.

 I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast. Come hungry!"}

I was greeted with kindness n seated promptly. They had a decent crowd already  there because duh the foods amazing! Idk if I can say the same for the staff there. Me n my daughter waited for 15 min for our waitress to come to the table. Her name was supposed to be Nina or somethin. I'm never met her. While I waited a waitress by the name of Ida asked if we've been helped. I told her no so she took our drink orders and said she'll have Nina come over to us. No Nina. Ida returned back and said no worries, I'll take your order and she also apologized for the wait. Wow. It wasn't even her fault. 2 different staff members brought us our food which was incorrect but I got more food than I was supposed to. As long as I wasn't charged. The lady placing the food in front of us told me to hurry up and grab my plate cause it's hot. HURRY UP???!  Well bitch ur a waitress wear a damn waitress sleeve. U can make them out of a sock! I eventually grabbed the plate but I was hesitant because it wasn't correct. Smh.. anyway I guess she tried to argue with me. Big no no. I just wanted to make sure i didn't have someone else's order from another table n i wanted butter not an argument. The manager is nice.. he walks around and ask how you doin. It's hard to pay before your food you might be interrupted by a rude waitress. I will return only because I want to be seated in Ida' s section.  She's a hustler a go getter n a hard worker!

There are so many great choices , our server was patient and great ( didn't get her name but she was Hispanic and very very helpful in narrowing our choices ) I opted for the American omelette with biscuit and a side of gravy my friend ordered a big breakfast plate and to start off we had to share a cup of baked potato soup, the soup came out piping hot and dressed with cheese and bacon and tasted amazing, along comes the omelette stuffed full of paper thin steak, mushrooms,onions and cheese ( I added American , it's the way to go ). It was also served with home fries which were big chunks of potatoes that were perfectly cooked and crispy on outside and hot and soft inside ! The combo of flavors in omelette were on point ! When my fork hit the cheese pockets I was in heaven !! My friend did share a piece of her waffle which was perfectly crisp and delicious , try it with strawberry butter !!

.
Went on Sunday 2-7-16 at 6PM.  $33.24 got us a thai tea, a coke, a combo platter appetizer, an individual dinner, and a chicken in hot garlic sauce entree.  The restaurant is located in the Smith's shopping center on Green Valley between Pebble & the 215.  
.
The restaurant is in fair condition and poor cleanliness. The table was sticky and the soap dispenser in the men's room was duct-taped to the wall.  Our server was prompt and friendly.  
. 
$7.95 Combo platter- An assortment of (2) egg roll, (2) butterfly shrimp, (2) crab rangoons and (2) paper wrapped chicken & BBQ pork.  The eggs rolls were filled with what I can only assume was a mixture of coleslaw and black pepper.  I've never had an eggroll like this and did not enjoy it although it was nicely fried.  The crab rangoons were my favorite part of the whole meal.  They have a good amount of filling and although devoid of crab they were very tasty.  The shrimp were not butterflied as their menu describes and were not de-veined.  They were fried nicely but I'm not a big fan of eating poo.  The "paper wrapped chicken" was really just like a chicken sausage wrapped in tiny triangles of tinfoil.  They were actually pretty tasty.  The barbecue pork was disgusting...tiny slivers of dried up pork sauteed in the same gooey pink sauce that is traditionally served with crab rangoons.  I was praying before I went to sleep that I didn't get food poisoning from anything I just mentioned. 
. 
$9.55 Individual dinner- I chose chow mein, crab rangoons, wonton soup, and orange chicken.  The chow mein was the super-cheap spaghetti kind with bean sprouts, green onions, and maybe a tiny sliver of carrot here or there.  Noodles were hot and had sub-par flavor but were fairly mushy.  The orange chicken was probably the worst I've ever had...very freezer burned and I was done after 4 bites.  The wonton soup was served boiling hot but the broth was terrible...it tasted like my breath when I wake up in the morning.  The wontons were complete mush and were so gross that I spit it out into my napkin.  
. 
$9.25 Chicken in hot garlic sauce- Sliced white meat chicken w/ carrots, mushrooms, diced bell pepper and onion stir fried in spicy Szechuan sauce.  My hubs told me the chicken was rubbery and the veggies were cheap and not cooked well.  It was an enormous amount of food for the price, however.  
. 
This place is not serving high quality or tasty food.  I am disappointed that I wasted over thirty bucks here.  I felt bad for our server who boxed up the leftovers knowing full well that they were going in the dumpster.  This is the kind of place where you wait til the waitress walks away and joke about the neighborhood cats going missing and I am shocked that it has 4 stars."}

We keep giving this place the benefit of the doubt, but I am finally done. They have very few tofu dishes on the menu, and most Chinese restaurants have no problem substituting tofu for chicken or beef in most of their regular dishes. Here, if you order sweet and sour "tofu" it is a "special order" and takes twice as long as other meals. That would be ok if it actually WAS a special order, made special in some way, but what you are given is a plate of dry, fried tofu and a side of sauce. Not sure how this constitutes "special" but ok.

Our last time here was on a particularly busy night, and (not smart of us) we didn't check the order until we got home and realized they left out a $7 order of fried rice. We had to drive back to the restaurant to pick up the rice, while the rest of our food got cold at home, and we were offered nothing as consolation for our troubles, other than the rice they forgot and a half-hearted apology. Free meal next time? Free appetizer for our trouble? No, nothing.

We won't be back."}

During breakfast, we waited for an extended amount of time for our drinks.. having to ask multiple times for our hot tea and encountered wrong food orders being brought to our table and missing items. The second attempt for lunch was much better. Today we also dined in for lunch. I ordered the chicken salad, which was flavored decently, however I encountered a grisly piece which ended that meal. My husband and daughter both ordered chicken fingers which came over cooked and were hard.

Two friends and I had breakfast/lunch here today and can't rave  enough about both the food and the service.
Janice had a southern omelette that comes  with toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries.
Colleen had crispy bacon,  eggs and fresh hashbrowns that were absolute perfection. I opted for the meatloaf dinner that comes with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. The meatloaf,  along with the fried chicken and waffles are their most requested dinners and I can see why. Everyone of us absolutely loved the food....fresh, hot and perfectly done.  The only downside: the coffee could be a little richer with a little more body, but that's how we saw it.

The service is professionally served by people who know what they're doing.Be sure  to ask for Leah or Darlene, both outstanding servers. 
If you haven't been here yet,  be sure to try METRO DINER. The restaurant was crowded on Sunday as it should be; an indication that they're doing something right."}

He asked what places to eat were over in the Smith's shopping center, and we meandered across the freeway.  We noticed China Tango was new, but I saw Jennifer C.'s review and knew at least a big plate of rice included with a dish would make Eric happy.

It looks like we should order at the counter, but the cashier handed us a menu and told us to sit at a booth since we were dine-in.  He gave us a styrofoam bowl of fried wonton strips and a plastic sauce cup of sweet n sour.

We got small styrofoam cups of water, styrofoam plates, and mini plastic forks.  We decided on egg drop soup (I was skeptical because soup was pricey like $5.25) and ginger and onion beef.  The soup came out immediately in a big plastic tub with a plastic spoon (not a ladle).  It had corn in it and was hot, just hard to serve in these small styrofoam bowls we had and little plastic spoons to eat it with.  

The ginger and onion beef had lots of green onions (good), bamboo shoots, red onions, and ginger.  Without a doubt, we received a huge plate of white rice.  The beef though - it looked good, but the texture was horrible.  You could call it "cheap meat" but I could not chew it.  I tried a few times and ended up spitting it out each time.  I ate the green onions with my rice instead.  At least the sauce was okay.

For the inedible dish and expensive soup, it was over $18.  Imagine if each person got a dish, yikes!  There is no value for your money.  Just lots and lots of styrofoam...! Will not return!"}

The service was very friendly and attentive and the food came out extremely fast and fresh. We started with the free wonton straps  which were very tasty but my kids and husband weren't so fond of. Then we had the fried wontons  (not pictured :( ) those were amazing and we actually fought over them we should have ordered a double order next time I know. Then we had the hot and sour soup which was super super yummy full of flavor and quality ingredients. Then we had our main course which we ordered the shrimp fried rice the kung Pau combination and the general chicken and as a bonus we got the Hong Kong chow mein (we didn't order it but the girl thought we did so she gave it to us for free). The general chicken was absolutely phenomenal I wish we had ordered two of them instead of the kung Pou combination. The flavors of the general chicken is a mix of sweet and spicy deliciousness. Such an amazing dish the kung Pou though left alot to be desired it lacked flavor that makes you want to take another bite it was also filled with more veggies then meat which is always a negative when your paying for a meat and seafood dish. The shrimp fried rice was gobbled up by my kids like they were eating for the apocalypse. The Hong Kong chow mein was okay there seemed to be a few bites of really good flavor then blandness which is not alot of fun to eat. All in all I would definitely be back the service was excellent and the dishes we loved were phenomenal and good enough to make us want to come back for more!"}

Placed an order on the phone and was told the food would be ready in 5-10 minutes. Reached there 10 minutes later and the order was ready. Wanted to use a coupon for free egg rolls with an order over $10 and told the guy me he would include them. They gave me 3 free egg rolls instead of 2:) Good for me, bad for my weight!!
I tried the kung pao shrimp and requested them to make it medium spicy. 
The servings of the shrimp as well  as the rice it comes with are super generous, and there was enough for 2 - 3 people.
The shrimp itself tasted great. Was the perfect blend of spice and flavor.

The restaurant had just one family dining in when I went to pick up my order at around 6 in the evening, but their phone was ringing continuously, and there were several take out orders lying ready to be picked up.

I will try this place again sometime."}

I truly appreciate their time and care they have shown regarding this situation. They both have reached out personally to ensure they could discuss this experience and I have updated my rating just purely because of the two of them. 


Absolute WORST experience EVER. We visited the Rainbow location last year before all the other locations opened and it was great! And we've been to the one on Serene several times and love it!! Don't even waste your time to come to this store. The manager, Lynn, spends her time with two other employees staring at their expo screen confused yet smiling and laughing as they point around trying to figure out the mess of their kitchen while then harassing customers outside the restaurant after we left!

Waited a good 8-10 minutes for our drink order and just put in our food order as well because it took that long for her to come to us, but the waitress was not our issue this visit. We ordered two Philly cheese steaks no onions, a French dip and the "holy divoli" burger medium rare. Then waited at least 20 minutes for her to continually tell us "it's coming don't worry they're a little slammed up there." Then we notice her talking to the manager, Lynn, as they are looking at the order screen with one other girl in a pink shirt all looking confused and pointing to the screen several times. Lynn then comes over to us to tell us the kitchen messed up the medium rare burger and over cooked it so "I'm the Mom and I made the call to just remake everything but it's at the top of the screen it will be right out." That sounded kind of nice due to not wanting one person to wait to eat, but we were slightly curious as to how they even knew they over cooked the burger? And my husband isn't picky enough to throw a fit over a slightly over cooked burger if they would have just explained when they brought it out; but we sure threw a fit afterwards. It then took 25 more minutes and our order was still not there! We finally see the burger up there and one of the sandwiches. Wait a few more minutes. Then the one of the sandwiches gets taken to another table!!! Mind you 7 other tables who got there after us got their orders while we were waiting. As soon as that other sandwich got delivered to another table and the burger that started it all continued to sit up there the waitress came over and we said,"this is just crazy. If that's not our food up there we are just going to leave." She just walked away. Three minutes later and still no food nor has Lynn or anyone come by to say anything at all, we got up and left. I turned around to come back and ask for the name of the manager (Lynn didn't have a name tag on and at that time I didn't know her name). She then proceeds to chase me as I walk out the door shouting "MA'AM MA'AM!" And then followed me outside harassing me saying, "I already paid for your food myself and it's fine just come back in and eat it!" We didn't go there because we couldn't afford our meal! We just wanted to have a nice dinner. The "B" food grade on the wall on the way out was another clear indicator we should have just went somewhere else. I have never been so upset by a poor restaurant or service I've received. I've worked in the food industry and completely understand things happen. But Lynn's manager skills and behavior was completely unacceptable. As I got in the car another customer walked out and said, "I just want to apologize for that restaurant. She was completely out of line." Very true. I will be calling their "manager partner," Peter tomorrow morning."}

They marinate it in the most flavorful seasonings, the waffles are so soft and good, not doughy at all.

I highly recommend them and I'm very happy they are in the neighborhood."}

iceberg, but no complaints with how it came. Will definitely be back!"}

We were looking for a new breakfast spot since one of favorites had closed.  We also heard a rumor that one of our favorite servers from another place was moonlighting here.  We were pleasantly surprised with the menu selection and portions.  Our 5 yr old fell in love with the biscuits and gravy. My favorite is the meat lovers omelet. Our favorite Server John A. was there and welcomed us warmly.  He is always friendly and attentive and has a joke or silly story to share. We are usually there for breakfast and John always tries to push the cobbler. We finally went for dinner, the chicken and waffles is amazing, the Shrimp and grits are delicious and so is the peach cobbler.  I recommend for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}

So, two stars. 

Now for more details:
I really wanted China Tango Bistro to be great since it's on my way home, but it's not great.  (sigh)  I can't even say it's serving good food or comfort food or tasty food.  It's just bland and I find myself pouring soy sauce or sweet and sour sauce on their dishes just to get some flavor.

Here's how much I wanted this place to be good: I went there for the Grand Opening and everything I ordered was bland.  Oh well, I thought, maybe they'll improve.  So I went back a second time and ordered off the specialty menu.  My stomach hurt that night from something that just wasn't properly prepared (even through it was still bland).  But I thought it might have just been a bad day for them, so I went back two more times.  Still little to no flavor in the variety of dishes that I tried.  

I have a tried a few items off the specialty menu but wasn't wowed.  And their classic Chinese food fare is . . . well, lacking flavor.  The pot stickers (pan-fried dumplings) taste like frozen dinner fare.  The fried wontons tasted good, but mostly because they are deep fried (everything deep fried tastes good) and dipped in a lot of sweet and sour sauce.  The General Tso's chicken was sweet and fried, but there was nothing to it beyond the sweetness and they were advertising it as a spicy dish.  And the Mongolian Beef was just blah.  

Bottom line: everything needs more seasoning, more spices, more heat, more ginger, more scallions . . . More.  More.  More.

All that said, I do want the place to stay and improve.  The folks that I've met there have always been very nice.  And when my order took a long time, they went out of their way to apologize and offered additional dishes to compensate for the delay.  I like the people, just not the food.  And I like them so much that I will proceed with blind hope and will probably stop by from time to time just to see if there's been improvement."}

We were seated and her came our server, Laura M. what a kick, friendly and very knowledgeable and very professional. We never disclosed the fact we were all old time waitresses. We just waited to see how we were treated, normally a bunch of women are not the best tippers.Our food was fabulous, a couple of ladies had salads, One had Chicken, a couple had breakfast and one had a cheeseburger. Hot and yummy. Our server Laura interacted with us even though quite busy.  Glad youre here Metro..Dynamite.  Our 3rd trip in was another mixed group, they all liked it and will be back, unfortunately didnt get her name this time, but service was great and a very sociable server also. I think her name was Wanda. It shoukld be noted my Brother and his wife have also been here numerous times also..And we will all be back.. Congratulations fine and fun Diner."}

The steak was cooked well and the coffee (hazelnut) was brewed in house!  Not that syrup thing that Starbucks puts in. I thought I didn't like hazelnut coffee. I was wrong. I loved it.

What really drives this place to the top is the server. John A. He was attentive, gregarious, and funny. Actually everyone in the restaurant was friendly and thanked us for coming in. It's really one of those places that reminds me of how restaurants used to be. I felt like they actually cared if I enjoyed not only the food but the experience too.

For some reason, this location isn't up to par with the service I have received at the others. If this location were my introduction to the chain, I probably wouldn't return.

First visit, I came in solo. After taking my order, I never saw my server again. There was an error with my order, and the hassle of having to hunt down the staff made me suck it up and eat it anyway. The seasonal pumpkin spice coffee was awesome. But seriously? Service was the total opposite of Tropicana and Rainbow locations.

Second (and last) visit, I interacted with the manager who was just totally unprofessional. I was there about a promo they were running on social media, and apparently this location wasn't participating. He was rude and dismissive. Maybe it was an off day for him. My server was super sweet and attentive, but I won't be back: as a two star Yelp rating indicates, "Meh. I've experienced better.""}

You'll probably have to go to China Town for better Chinese fare.

FOOD:  4/5.  

-The sweet and sour pork was delicious.  The only thing bad about it was the excessive amount of breading.  
-If I had one last meal, their crab rangoon would be my appetizer.  It's basically a deep fried wonton with imitation crab and cream cheese inside.  It was delicious.  
-Perhaps the best thing about China Tango IMO is their sweet and sour sauce.  It's mildly sweet and mildly sour, and was balanced out perfectly.  At other Chinese restaurants I tend to ask for an extra side of hot mustard to balance out their sweet and sour sauce.

SERVICE:  4/5.

-I asked the dude that worked at the counter how long it would take.  He estimated 6-7 minutes.  I think it took around 10 minutes.  Overall they were friendly.

AMBIENCE: 3/5.

-Imagine clean fast food joint.  That's pretty much it.  There is outdoor seating, not for any one particular restaurant.

This restaurant chain has 3 locations across the valley (and according to their website, another one opening soon on Serene and Eastern). It specializes in big portions and comfort food.

Interior: Many tables and booths available. Like the name implies, it looks exactly like any other All-American diner. The decor is very cute and reminds me of all the lunches eaten in the middle of long road trips in small towns along the way to my destination.

Service: Service was pleasant. Our waitress was very nice, knowledgeable of the menu, and very accommodating. Food came out quickly.

Food:
Bold City Burger ($12.99): Consisted of Provel cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage, fried jalapeños, and garlic aioli on a brioche bun with a side of fries. My boyfriend ordered this and fell in love with it. The burger was gigantic and a lot more filling than he anticipated. He only finished half of it, and that's saying something considering he's a never-ending vacuum (still love him, though!).

Fried Chicken and Waffles ($15.99): Maybe I don't eat a lot, but this plate can easily feed two people. It comes with 3-4 giant pieces of fried chicken, a whole Belgian waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar on top, strawberry butter, and their signature sweet and spicy sauce (it's basically Louisiana hot sauce and syrup). They really meant it when the menu said it was half a chicken! The chicken was crispy and the breading was not too heavy. The sauce gives a good kick to it and you could add as much (or as little) hot sauce to your mixture as you need. Since the fluffy Belgian waffle already had powdered sugar on it, I was afraid that the strawberry butter would cause it to have a sweetness overload. Thankfully, the flavor of the strawberry butter was subtle.

I had my doubts considering this is a chain restaurant. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I will be returning here soon. This time, with an emptier stomach!"}

We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and promptly seated. The restaurant had a positive energy, relaxed feel, and cool retro diner vibe. All the staff, including the management, were very friendly throughout the meal. Kiki our waitress arrived at our table promptly and asked if it was our first time dining with them. We said it was, and she explained the menu to us. She gave us time to review the menu and recorded our order on a tablet computer, instead of the old-school paper and pen method. I was surprised and pleased with the large variety of menu items. The prices were good and the portions exceeded my expectations. Prior to our food arriving we noticed a piece of food on one of our forks that didn't come off in the dishwasher. We were not upset but made sure to inform our waitress, who immediately informed the manager. Not sure if he was the store owner or manager, but he promptly stopped by our table and apologized, giving us two $5 off coupons to the restaurant. The manager was very congenial and chatted with us about our families for about five minutes...very cool guy! Kiki did a great job attending to us during the meal. The food was excellent and arrived at an appropriate temperature. Payment for the meal was done via debit card on the tablet computer, allowing for TIP addition. As we left the restaurant we were thanked by at least three Metro Diner staff and one of them held the door open for us as we left. VERY impressed with this restaurant...will definitely be back!"}

I've been in the Valley for a while now and just a little over a year ago I FINALLY found a Chinese food restaurant that was actually really GOOD and reminiscent of one you would find anywhere along the NE coast. I loved this place, but ended up moving to Henderson. A visit to my fav place would make me invest in a 45 min round trip to Summerlin. 
We tried a few new places around GV, Eastern and so on...to see if there was anything close,  until we experienced China Tango. It is just as good as my spot in Summerlin and that's not an easy feat! 
It's a small restaurant, but it looks clean and the atmosphere is pleasant. I like that you can see the kitchen, and if so inclined- you can watch them cook your food. My absolute favorite thing is that I can order for delivery from the YELP app. 
Even better, every interaction I've had with either a delivery person, cashier or wait staff, has been nothing short of pleasant. Even last night, I ordered dinner and when I opened my front door, the delivery man was smiling and said "Here's your dinner!" I love these guys and it's small gestures like that, that totally win me over. 
Great job China Tango!!
Sincerely, one of your new local regulars :)"}

Metro Diner certainly delivered to my expectations of diner comfort food. I have seen the location on Rainbow, but I am elated they opened another location in Henderson. 

I went on a Sunday morning and it was packed, but was seated in about 2 minutes by a very friendly host. The server, Leah, was very sweet and knowledgeable. There was sincerity in the customer service I can appreciate. She went over the menu noting the items highlighted in green are items unique to their diner and/or has been featured in the Fiid Network's show-Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. They also feature flavored coffee and flavor iced teas that changes daily. Also, breakfast is served all day and evening. There is plenty of staff working the kitchen and the dining area, which was great to see because it was so busy, but no one looked frazzled and patrons were checked up on frequently.

I tried the Monte Cristo and John's Senior's sandwich. The Monte Cristo was huge! Definietly a shareable plate. It came with a side of I think blackberry jam which added a bright and fruity note to the very filling battered and fried sandwich. The turkey was very moist and the ham was not too salty. Did I mention the jam? Be sure to dip the sandwich in it! It went surprisingly well together. 

The John's Senior sandwich was named after the owner's father because he came up with it and was one of his favorites. It had bacon, swiss cheese, 2 sunny side eggs (cooked medium) and a slather of good ol' mayo. Served between two sliced multigrain bread. The egg yolks oozed ever so slightly and the tang of the mayo went well with the smoky bacon. For something so simple, it was done well.

Server came by with the tablet to pay. You can pay with plastic or cash. I was a little thrown off if I needed to pay a little early since I was still working on my meal, but I didn't mind since I was able to finish my meal at the end without feeling rushed.

All in all, service and food met my expectations of comfort diner food. Genuinely friendly and efficient staff. Plenty of other diner items to try in the future. Will be back for sure. Welcome to the neighborhood Metro Diner!"}

We first walked in and were sat immediately, the diner was very busy and cleanly.. they have a open kitchen so you can watch staff make the entrees! The staff was nice but a little to attentive.. they literally came by about 8 times with in 20 mins I mean I appreciate it I really do but at least give me sometime to actually try to enjoy my food, also after placing our entrees down we literally received the bill 5 mins later -guess I didn't want to try dessert. The hazelnut coffee was unfortunately not on point it was very bland and watery. I ordered the western omelette and the presentation was nice the hash browns were delicious just the right amount of soft and crunch your looking for and the (egg) omelette itself was very fluffy and delicious .. but when cutting in to the omelette a bunch of liquid poured out I assume water from the soggy onions and tomatoes, the cubes of ham inside must have trapped the moisture??? The English muffin was good except for one side was a little burnt! I will have to give 1 more try, maybe when there not super busy!"}

My boyfriends grandparents took us out to breakfast cuz nothing makes things better like breakfast! But nothing was more upsetting than walking in and seeing smiling faces enjoying breakfast and the world going on after 58 people had just been murdered. 

I cried when an employee asked if he could get us a drink and I cried when our server asked how we were all doing. They probably had no idea why I was crying until the grandparents told them we had just had the worst night of our lives. Our server was patient, understanding, soothing, and so kind. The food was probably delicious just like it was three days before when we went for breakfast, but I couldn't tell ya for sure due to being in shock. A manager bought our meal when she got word of our situation and her kindness made me cry even more, and it even shook my boyfriend up a bit who hardly ever cries. It was so nice to be met with such genuine kindness and care after losing faith in humanity. 

I can't say enough thanks to the staff that morning that brought a bit of light into the oncoming dark months. It's been a year and I realized every time I think of that morning it makes me emotional because of the amazing staff that showed sympathy and care. THANK YOU METRO DINER for a wonderful memory in a cluster of terrible ones. Sorry I'm a year late."}

Then all topped with blueberry compote which is the only part along with the waffle itself that i ended up eating. 

Service wise our waitress was lovely but she had half the restaurant and was constantly interrupted by other guests trying to get her attention while she was waiting on us.

The food we ordered came hot and fresh and everything that everyone had was delicious and cooked as requested. Our server was attentive, friendly and very good. I believe her name was Rianna or something along those lines. Either way she was amazing. In talking to get her she said things have slowed down. I am not sure if it is the location or what but this is easily one of the better breakfast in Henderson. The prices are par as anywhere else with nice size portions. I will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner too as many of the lunch plates we saw looked amazing. Take my advice and bring the family down and have a nice "home cooked" breakfast with friendly service at fair prices.

*Side note to owner - lower the price on sides or increase amount given. $4.29 for a side of bacon with 3 medium pieces isn't fair to patron. This could help get butts in the seats. Want this place to succeed."}

This is SUPER nitpicky now, but my eggs were poached too long because I didn't get the satisfaction of being able to pop the yolk over my dish and the philly, personally, needed a slice or two more cheese so you can have that gooey-ness with every bite...BUT despite those hiccups, it didn't bother us because the food was STILL super flavorful and tastey!

Everything tastes super fresh and they don't use MSG, which is immediately obvious because you don't feel like crap while/after eating. They give you HUGE servings, so I recommend sharing an entree if you're not looking to take anything home. 

My first visit, I ordered crab rangoon, pot stickers, wonton soup, sesame chicken, and house chow main. All of the meat is juicy and tender! We had leftovers for days and only paid about 40 bucks for all of that! Everything was delicious. 

My second visit, I placed a takeout order and it was ready on time! I ordered pot stickers, hot & sour soup, house chow fun, salt & pepper shrimp, sweet & sour chicken,  and taro boba. Nothing was soggy and everything tasted great! 

My only complaint would be that they don't use larger shrimp for the salt & pepper shrimp- they use the salad size and it's $11."}

Both times we had John A. as our server. He is super funny and is great at what he does. He and the rest of the staff make us feel at home like we're chillin with family. 

The food we've ordered has all been delicious. I've eaten pretty much everything on my plate! My husband loves the food so much he usually orders something to take home. The first time I ordered a Yo Hala with a side of turkey sausage. All I have to say is YUM! The Yo Hala was pretty sweet, but the salt from the sausage balanced it out. My dad and husband got the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. It comes with a lot of food so if you're hungry you will be satisfied. If you're not that hungry you can either share it with a friend or take home the leftovers. My husband ordered the Holy Davoli sandwich to go. He ate that for his late night dinner. 

The second time we went I ordered a chicken pot pie. I loved it because it wasn't too thick or have too much crust like some I've tried before. My dad ordered the meatloaf and husband ordered the chicken & waffles again. My husband sampled the chicken pot pie and like it so much he cleaned the bowl for me (see pictures). lol. He also liked my dad's meatloaf so he ordered a meatloaf sandwich to go. We tried the strawberry cobbler for dessert. It had a hard piece of ice cream on top which melted with the warmth from the cobbler. It was a little sweet, but it went well with the ice cream. 

I'd definitely order the same things again, but I want to explore more of the menu. I think we'll be going again today. I wonder what I'll get this time..."}

Where I live I'm pretty much smack dab in between two very similar establishments, so in the end it's really the value I go for.

I LOVE the delivery service from here. One reason being they don't have a minimum order amount for delivery. Their arrival is always earlier than the time they estimate for me, which is awesome when you're tired and starving. AND they also pack it up in the box, so there's no mess and it's really easy to carry a large order in. I'm always thankful for that since my dog is usually going crazy when I bring in the Goods. I just know I can depend on it, especially after a long day or discussion of "What do you want to eat? I don't know, what do you want to eat?".

As for the food... My husband and I pretty much always order completely different meals, so the Individual Dinners ($9.95) are perfect for us. It lets us order our own appetizer, soup, entree and side, so we aren't obligated to compromise with ordering the family sizes of anything. The flavor is usually on point, but even when it's not, it's never something a little spice from home can't fix.

Overall: the service is quick, the food is fresh, the prices are reasonable, and after getting pretty consistent quality over 6 years, you can't ask for too much more."}

I open the door and it's heavy like it's spring loaded, we step in and sure enough the door slams behind us with a loud bang! Ooops I thought and I see the waitress cleaning the booths on the far wall, even with that loud booming door slam she didn't even acknowledge us, back turned to us and not even any eye contact or "hello, I'll be with you in a moment"  We take a table and still no welcome what so ever. We are both looking at her and she goes on wiping tables and not a glance our way. She is actually cleaning the rest of the booths and continues to ignore us. My wife says, "lets get out of here" and I thought so too, but I needed to eat before I went to work and so we stayed. I had to yell out, "could we get a couple menus?" and the waitress was really unwelcoming and cold. I am like, what in the world is she doing serving tables? Maybe she is working two jobs and is really burned out or someone pissed her off recently? but we are the only ones in the place.  As we looked over the menu some other people came in and she again acted like she didn't want to serve anybody. I've had better service at Carls Jr. and if they weren't a few miles away we would have went there instead.
The burgers were good and a 1/2 pound double was too much for our appetites. Fries were excellent and the cook with the black cap back there is doing a great job on the food. The waitress circled our table a few times, but never spoke to us to ask how everything was luckily my wife somehow got a refill on her drink. When she circled around us, I asked for our check and she was grovelling to herself and replied back like, "I"LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU AS SOON AS I COME BACK"  We left a few dollars tip and with that cold treatment from the waitress we over tipped in our opinion. People like that should not be serving food, we liked the food, but will never be back considering the unfriendly waitress."}

I work nearby and haven't been back to Henry's for at least a year because of a temporary job assignment that took me out of the area for a time. What a difference a year makes! Always enjoyed lunch here because the service was quick, the food excellent and the staff friendly. While our waiter was very nice and efficient - how can a place go downhill so fast? I was warned by my fellow employees (we have over 100) that it wasn't the same. An understatement. The 1/2 lb. burger was always large with 2 patties and a great bun. The one I received for lunch last week was much smaller and looked smushed. And the cheese!?!?!? I guess it was cheese. Ordered cheddar but what was on my burger looked liked some kind of secret sauce. (And I don't want to know what the 'secret' is). It was like an orange wet spread. My wife told me that they were using 'cheap' cheese and that's why it 'melted' like it did (more like 'liquified'). SO DISAPPOINTED! How can a place like this stay open? Is it under new ownership? Management? The food was always like homemade. Their special St Patrick's Day offering was always incredible but I can't bring myself to return again. So sad. You would think with the fabulous METRO DINER as a next door neighbor, Henry's would actually stay on their toes. Amazing."}

Recently my Mom and I were on our way to another nearby restaurant, but I realized that we were so close to Henry's that we should just stop, so we did.  And I am glad we did!

Located in a strip mall off Stephanie St., it's kind of hidden away.  Kind of a random spot for a 24 hour bar/restaurant.

First of all, only the bar side is actually open 24 hours.  The restaurant side closes at 10pm on weeknights (not sure about weekends).  After the restaurant closes, you have to be 21 to dine, since it's in the bar.  No big deal.

We entered the restaurant and were approached by the server, who told us to sit wherever we like.  We chose a booth and she gave us menus.  They have quite a selection!  From appetizers to salads, to burgers, pasta, steak, etc!

My Mom and I just about always share everything.  We decided to split the 1/2 size cobb salad, the 1/2 size mac 'n cheese and the ribeye steak.

The first thing you should know is that the portions here are pretty big.  Come hungry!  Our salad was good and came with all of the typical fixin's - hard boiled egg, bleu cheese, olives, avocado, bacon, chicken, etc.  It was larger than we expected, and pretty good.

The mac n cheese came in a large bowl, and I couldn't believe it was only the 1/2 portion.  It's supposedly made with 5 cheeses and roasted red pepper, which added a different touch.  I don't think it was a my favorite ever, but it was OK.  I would like to go back and try the habanero hamburger mac n cheese.  Sounds right up my alley!

Our ribeye was huge and cooked perfectly (medium rare).  It came with a side of snap peas and we chose jasmine rice for something different.  Everything was really tasty.  Unfortunately, the server mentioned that they are changing the menu and the ribeye will only be available for about 2 more weeks.  Then it will be replaced by a t-bone.

We were pretty stuffed, but couldn't pass up trying the brownie dessert.  Holy crap, this is a chocolate lover's heaven!  It was a LARGE brownie, topped with hot fudge, vanilla ice cream, ANOTHER LARGE BROWNIE (!!), more hot fudge and then whipped cream and cherries.  It was humongous and way more than we could eat.  Very rich as well.  I would definitely recommend this for all of you with sweet tooths!

The service was fast and friendly, although there wasn't really anyone else in the place while we were there.  The server also mentioned to us that just about everything is home made.  They don't buy anything frozen, they roast all of the meats in house, etc.  That's good to know!

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner.  I would definitely go back, and I have to return to try this graveyard special burger everyone raves about!"}

I had the Savannah burger and OH MY GOD was it delicious. Cooked to perfection. My wife had a burger as well and enjoyed as well as my mother in law who had a salad and was highly impressed. We split the brownie sundae for dessert and left excited and FULL. 

This place is great if you just want some delicious food and SPACE to enjoy it. There is a bar section on the other side, but it's kinda dark and smokey so we decided against it. I'm sure the service is just as good in there."}

Stopped in for lunch, it was Sunday and the playoffs were on, the place was packed and only one server, not sure what management was thinking on a Playoff Sunday.

Kim did an AWESOME job keeping everything flowing as best she could.  The cooks were ok today, the house salad was lacking, only two cucumbers instead of the normal other then that is was only carrots, tomatoes and lettuce.  This was disappointing and will be brought up next time I am in.

They were two cooks and they were working non stop but skimping on things is not the way to get things done.

Anyway, still at the top of the list for burgers, wings and the staff is always friendly and enjoyable."}

The server was great, she checked up often, offered her recommendations, and overall demonstrated a friendly demeanor.

I rate this 3 stars because of the lack of sanitation we witnessed when dining in. They hired this older waitress who must've never been in the food industry before or was just plain careless. 

She was serving a large group of people and when she brought their food out she placed her entire hand on top of this girl's hamburger instead of holding both of her hands on the side/under the plate like you're supposed to do. Seconds later she checks on another table and they ask for extra napkins and she wiped her hand on it and gave it to the customer. 

I guess I'm more baffled at the fact between both instances neither customer spoke up. If it wasn't for witnessing that this place probably would've gotten at least 4 stars. All I can say is luckily we had the server with common sense."}

Waffle fries were good, blackened chicken quesadilla was good 

My mom ordered chicken fried steak, super greasy and then breeding didn't even stick to the steak, plus they drowned it in gravy when it was asked to be put on the side.. 


Unfortunately the second time was a huge let down, they didn't follow my specific instructions on the order and the food just wasn't nearly as  good.. I may try it one more time but I will probably wait a while.."}

Feeling lazy, we walked over to Henry's for some comfort food. Before we walked in there was a chalkboard listed with the daily specials: split pea soup and chicken stroganoff. Instantly, I felt like I was going to have dinner at some American's household. We walked in around 2pm and the restaurant section was completely empty. The bar section had a few of customers inside video gaming and drinking. (The bar and restaurant is sectioned off by a door. As soon as you enter, you are in the restaurant and you just need to open the door on the right to get to the bar.)

Pros: 
We ordered fish & chips and club sandwich. The fish & chips came with cole slaw and for the club sandwich we got a side of pasta salad. The portions were huge; I'd say 4 people could have shared this meal. We liked the quality of the fish & chips because they used actual filets (and not mystery fish meat) and we liked the coat of crispy batter. The fries were decent, nothing remarkable. The club sandwich was a hit! They packed it in with real turkey meat (not turkey ham) and layers and layers of ham. All in all, it was a solid American lunch. 

Kimberly was our waitress and she was really friendly and was great at her job. We ordered a diet coke and she brought a pitcher of it so we don't have to keep asking for refills. How convenient!

Open 24hrs!

Cons: 
The decor is not welcoming or comforting at all. No real sunlight gets into the restaurant (windows are tinted), the booths are designed with tacky patterns, there are wine bottles held on these wirey frames (uhm...is it a wine tree?) and there are reminiscent 1920's-1930's bar pictures. And due to the adjacent bar, some of the cigarette smoke leaks into the restaurant. In my opinion, it'd be better to visit Henry's at night after a couple drinks. 

BTW: It cost $0.40 extra to get a side of ranch! I don't mind the cost, but seriously?

OMG these are terrific - a great bargain for great quantity and quality food.

I first came here way back in July when I had just moved out here. My friends were coming to visit, and they had been stuck in traffic for a long time...resulting in them arriving hours past when they were supposed to. Yelp for late night food brought me to this gem. The first time I went, my friends and I, looked at the prices of their graveyard specials and assumed it would be small portions. We couldn't have been more wrong. The portions were very generous! Especially considering the price. I think we accidentally ordered enough to feed an elephant...if an elephant ate cheeseburgers, nachos, pizza, and the like.

I've gone back a couple times since...and every time the food is consistently delicious and a steal. My favorites are the pulled pork sandwich and garlic parmesan chicken tenders. Their pizza is pretty good too. The pulled pork sandwich has just enough kick to it make it something special. The flavor in the garlic parmesan chicken fingers is delicious - I like that they use from what I can tell, shredded parmesan and fresh garlic - not just like powdered parmesan. The teriyaki ones are pretty good as well. Quality and quantity of pizza and toppings is also really good as well as the size of the pizza itself.

The pulled pork sandwich is this big monster...there is a fork in the napkin roll...use it...it will be your friend. The tenders are only $1 each (though they're sold in pairs). These tenders aren't your McDonalds mighty kids fingers...no sir...each one is like the size of my hand. There are 11 preparations you can choose from too to suit your fancy.

In terms of service...it's as fast as it can be given the circumstances. When I go late at night, there's only one person there running the place both bringing orders and working the bar...I think his name is Tom. My guess is there's very few people in the kitchen, maybe even only one. When it's busy, service can be a bit slow (i.e. friday, saturday night). - so I guess this is kind of a quasi complaint. But since there's only one person there running himself ragged, I'm not taking off points. He's also really friendly no matter how busy it is, which I really appreciate.

My one complaint is that the bar area is pretty smoky. Ventilation isn't great. But it's tolerable.


One of these days, I do need to come back to try food on the regular menu, but when I come here late at night, it seems like too much of a shame to not take full advantage of the graveyard specials.

Thank goodness for this place to satisfy my late night munchies. i do stay up late much more than I should...and I'm really glad i found this gem. The value for food from the graveyard menu really can't be beat."}

One waitress and 1 other table. Asian chicken salad? Cabbage swimming in dressing, topped by a scarcely cooked chicken breast. Took one bite and inspected the sliced breast - not thoroughly cooked. Waitress is nowhere; after about 10 minutes I took it to the cook myself. He argued that it was indeed cooked; further cooking would burn it. I asked him to return it to the grill anyway. He used his HANDS to pluck slices off the top, then grilled them. After a few moments of sizzling (which seemed promising) he used a spatula to return the slices to my salad while I stood at the service counter. I brought the plate back and bit into a piece of chicken that still had that unmistakable raw texture. Waitress still nowhere. I couldn't even nibble the sad heap of cabbage. Finished my wine, which was supposed to be Pinot Grigio; not sure what sort of wine it actually was; color and flavor more like Chardonnay. Left hungry.

The times that we have been have been at dinner, close to peak dinner times, it has never been crowded. I like a place that you know you can go to and just have a quiet meal and a conversation. Henry's is that place. There is a good variety of tasty food and the staff is at your table just enough to take care of your needs, without being overbearing. 
The bar is next to the restaurant, but it is separated by glass and doors. On the way out I did catch a whiff of cigar smoke from the bar, but it wasn't near the booths where we were eating.

The wings were over cooked, they were supposed to be garlic Parmesan, what used to be a lot of garlic and Parmesan, now is barely garlic and Parmesan.  They just were not the same, they used to be covered in garlic and Parmesan.

The BLT was good but again something from the taste was missing.  It seemed like the bacon was not only over cooked but it almost seemed like they are using a different kind then they used to.

This was a great place for comfort food now it is just an ok place.  They do not have wifi still so that makes it inconvenient as a place to hang or meet with people if you need Internet access.

All in all, this visit was less then spectacular.  I may give it another try some day but there really is no rush after the last two experiences."}

So who can say no to a place that has waffle cut fries on the menu? In we went. On a side note my gps told me it was on the wrong side of the road, so if you are starting and not seeing it anywhere..It's on the west side of the street.

Anyway. We were promptly greeted by a server who was very friendly. The menu is huge, which I love and hate. I was the kid that was so torn between choosing between candy choices as a kid that my mom would actually have to do a countdown for me and it ALWAYS was a last minute selection.... and I still.have that problem. Anyway. I got the... crap.. It's the brisket sandwich on focaccia with roasted peppers, sports, gouda, horseradish.. Ugh my memory. My husband got the German burger and even though.we did not need it, we got  order of the habenero hamburger Mac and cheese.. when in Rome. 

Food was prompt. I live that we got mini pitchers of our drinks. So much easier. Those were refilled And I never faced an empty glass while needing to cool down my fiery habenero mouth.

My sandwich was delicious. A great flavor combo and I was thankful for having unique menu options too choose from. I hate having to choose between a cheeseburger, chicken fingers, and a club. Boring. The only complaint I had was by the time I.Got to the end it was a little soft and started to fall apart on hand.

The Mac was delightful. Definitely NOT shy on the habeneros. Definite heat. We.live on spicy food (like I go.through more cayenne than any spice in my.cabinet..salt included) 

Hubbys burger was oddly good too. I really.worried because it arrived in all of its messy topping glory, which I.knew my husband would have no patience for one it started to.squish out the sides and fall apart. Shockingly, it didn't. Amazing! I'm not  kraut fan at all but.I.sampled a bite.and the flavors all worked together. 

The prices are decent. You.get plenty of food and it is very good. I'm.glad we tried something new and am happy to add it to the rotation.

So, for some good tasty food with excellent friendly service give it a whirl."}

The reviews, tips, and pics had me sold before we were even there. My only main question is this- how the hell did I not know about a 24/7 spot, that's close to my house, that me and my bf can eat salads and appetizers and entrees for $34?!!??! All together we ordered: 2 sodas, a nachos app, a gravy fries app, a 1/2 size house salad, 1/2 size POTW (pasta of the week), and a nacho burger. 
Originally we ordered the gravy fries along side the burger, but she brought out a whole order. We weren't complaining, especially when it wasn't any extra on our tab! The house salad was good. Fresh with yummy dressing. The nachos were bomb. I love good nachos and these had chili and cheese with sour cream and green onions then a side of jalapeños and salsa that went great with it. The POTW was chicken curry with mushrooms and onions. This was the only thing I wouldn't order again. Not that it was bad, the chicken was cooked right and the veggies were good. It was just bland. It lacked the flavor you expect from anything with curry in the title. My bf devoured his nacho burger, it had cheese oozing out the side that went on his fries. (Who doesn't like cheesy fries) so yes he has cheesy fries and gravy fries, don't judge. 
My only negative observation was they seemed understaffed. I watched all of my food sit in the window for 1-3 minutes before being served to me. All the while there was a second waitress who looked like she wanted nothing to do with the other one, nor her tables as she wouldn't even make eye contact with us. Our waitress, (Kimberly was the name on the ticket) was still great and even apologized for being so rushed. 
Overall I had a good experience and can't wait to return to try the mushroom blue cheese burger. And probably many other things as well. 
Thanks Shirley B. and Vegas J. 
Shirley and I are already known for running into each other randomly so maybe I will see you guys there one day!"}

Major issue is the management is very  petty about charging additional fees for substituting  very minor items is going to hold the restaurant from getting the fifth star .

If a customer wants a Turkey dip and wants to substitute turkey for roast beef there shouldn't charge a fee to switch the two meats. 

Granting a small change for a customer at no charge, will get you return business!

We really enjoyed the food, however we like turkey dips too and at most other restaurants that serve both turkey and Roast beef they will all substitute turkey for beef.

Our family favorite is Thursday night, prime rib night. Most of the time the food is right on. But, I have eaten there where the rolls have been over cooked, prime rib is over cooked, vegetables look like they have been around since the beginning of time and then on top of it, the food is served cold. There breakfast is good and burgers are a great deal. Service isn't good if the motorcycle club is there. Too many people to be served at once. We have suffered through this enough, that we no longer go when we see the club there. When club isn't there, service is fantastic.

Walking into the bar area you do get a big whif of cigarettes. You can also dine in the bar area but we decided to be away from the cigarette smell and dined in the dining area. 

I ordered the southwestern burger and my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich.

Make sure you come with an appetite because the portion size is pretty big . 
Both meals had lots of yummy flavors and some spice to it.

- Right-half is a dimly lit bar.
- Left-half of the establishment is a well-lit family friendly restaurant.
- Service was good and for the iced tea and ice water we ordered, the waitress left at our table a pitcher of iced tea and a pitcher of ice water.
- Unfortunately food was not good except for the side order of french fries.  My friends said the soup of the day was too salty and they couldn't even finish half of it.  My $11 steak & eggs order: meat was really subpar (and I already had low expectations from a $11 steak & eggs meal) and the hash browns were burnt.  The 2 eggs were good.
- I would only come back for the bar to booze, or to eat while boozed."}

Henry's had PLENTY of room, and now I understand why. As soon as we got there, our eyes began burning from the smoke drifting in from the bar next door. My wife whispered to me when I noticed it, but we were trying to be nice since someone else was picking up the tab.

There were 3 tables occupied when we got there. It took almost 15 minutes before someone came for our drink order, and we barely interacted with our server for the remainder of the meal. The soda was flat, but she was nice enough to bring us each our own mini-pitcher. I ordered the ribeye (med-rare) and a Caesar salad. The salad was absolutely drowning in dressing and soggy.

Well over an hour after we sat down we finally had our entrees. The steak was good. Not exceptional, but more than I had expected. Some parts of it were over-charred/dry and it really detracted from the natural flavor of the meat. It was a very fatty/sinewy cut, and I felt mislead by the quality promised on the menu. They served it with peas that didn't seem to be seasoned at all and could have come right out of your grocer's freezer.

The fries and barbecue sauce were a bright spot. Both had great flavor and were absolutely addicting. Unfortunately that didn't save a very disappointing dining experience."}

First walked into the bar side, but being a nonsmoker, had to retreat to the restaurant side. Service was quick and friendly. Asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hank or a Burger. Went for the Hank, and a Nut brown beer. Food and drink came quick.  Large prime rib with lots of crunchy fries. Beer was good and nice and cold, not flat or warm.  Generous amount of peppers and onions on the sandwich.  Was hot fresh and tasty. Prime rib was cut nice with little fat but still juicy and tender.  Only criticism would be that the bread got a little soggy.  Ended up eating second half with fork and left bread.  I would recommend Henry's to anyone that is looking for good food at a good price. Was not blown away, but was happy overall. I would come back."}

Yelp is typically pretty accurate. Brought my wife and kids. The place is half restaurant  half bar. Separated by a glass door. 

The food

We'll start here, 'cause that's what's important.
we ordered the fried clams (pretty good), "the world's best" macaroni......not so much. I'm pretty sure it had turned bad already. Everything else was barely mediocre. 

Service

Our waitress was a very nice lady, but unfortunately the worst waitress.....ever. she took forever to do anything. She was around, just didn't react to things you'd expect. Missing silverware and napkins. You basically were better off getting things from the kitchen yourself. 

Location

Outside looks good. Inside, the smoke smell was like the old Klondike casino. I am a hardcore smoker, and don't mind indoor smoke smell when I'm drinking or with buddies, but I want my kids to choose whether they want to smoke or not. It definitely should not be advertised as a family establishment."}

It's in the same strip mall as the place we mail packages, so I've driven by it several times.  Today, we finally had lunch here.  The dining room is bigger than you would expect given its location, with room between most of the tables.  They had some pushed together, but it was not close to being crowded, so it didn't matter.  We were waited on immediately (service was excellent throughout the meal), and as a few yelpers note, they leave a pitcher of your selected beverage (for us, Dr. Pepper and water) at your table.  Also, I request a lot of ice in my fountain drinks.  The server brought me a whole glass of ice in addition to the pitchers.  The glasses at Henry's are large, so the pitcher was about a refill, maybe a little more.  But, I feel like this touch demonstrates a little care for the customer.  Also, we all know how frustrating it can be to eat, finish your drink, and you can't get the server's attention for a refill while you are still eating.  I wish more restaurants would adopt Henry's practice.  They probably lose a little bit of soda or tea when pitchers aren't finished, but that's maybe 2 cents worth of liquid, well worth it to provide better service in my estimation.

We had chips and salsa to start.  The salsa was good consistency, not runny like some chains, but also not totally chunky like pico de gallo.  The chips needed some salt and weren't warm, but that's not a huge issue.  To eat, the wife had the shrimp dinner.  This is a fantastic deal, 7 large fried shrimp, a huge order of fries and a portion of cole slaw for $10.  The shrimp was not overly done, which can happen when it's fried.  Excellent consistency.  The fries are of a thickness between thin fries (think McDonald's) and steak fries.  The breading was crunchy.  Very very good fries.  I will say the ranch appeared to be from a bottle.  I couldn't say for sure, but it was probably the least impressive part of the meal.

I had the bourbon BBQ burger with waffle fries.  This was a very juicy burger.  It's a large burger consisting of 2 patties on an onion bun.  I could have used more fried onions.  They are smaller, not the longer shoestring type onions.  So, they often fell out.  It was tough to get a complete bite of all the ingredients together.  The bacon was very VERY crispy.  I'm okay with it this done, but a lot of people aren't.  I had to finish the burger with my fork it was so messy.  But, it was fantastic.  And, it was only $9.  I didn't even finish the waffle fries, there were that many on the plate.  These were large and very well seasoned.  

Although we didn't go into the bar, it looked comfortable.  A large bar with a couch area that had a couple of chairs.  Looked to be very cozy, and had a few people in around 1 pm on Sunday.

We will definitely return, and like I said, I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner."}

We started with gravy fries, something every diner in NJ had growing up.  I have to say, these are some of the best gravy fries in Las Vegas.  Crisp, startchy fries covered in a gooey gravy that reminds me of... well, hometown diners.

For our main course, my daughter had buttered pasta which was shells.  It could have used a little more flavor but she enjoyed it.  The two large pieces of garlic bread was too much for a kids meal and one half piece would have been sufficient. (This is not a negative, but more of a suggestion that would both save money and keep the kids from eating too many carbs.)  I went with the fried clams.  The clams themselves were real clams, chewy and stretchy.  They would have been great but the coating was overcooked and to heavily coated so it was difficult to get the clam flavor without peeling off the coating. Next time I will try one of their specials like country fried steak. 

For desert we split a fudge sundae.  The staff was happy to take the peanuts off for us even though the menu stated they were on there and we just didn't pay attention.  

Service was excellent. Our server was very attentive, very honest about the menu options and made sure we had everything we needed several times.

I enjoyed that they bring a whole pitcher of tea or lemonade to your table so you don't have to find them for a refill.  Henry's is a great addition to the Henderson cuisine.  I am hopeful my next trip will raise the rating a star."}

At first it was because Dyanna L told me they had $3 bloody mary's on Sunday's during football. But the food is excellent as well! Plus, super reasonably priced considering how much food you get.

So right off I ordered a Bloody Mary. Be prepared to wait. The waitress rocks, it's just there is only one of her, but it's worth the wait to me. My drink was super strong and tangy! Just how I like it. It also came with a lemon and olive for garnish. As for their other drinks like soda, tea or water they serve it to you in a little pitcher so you can refill it yourself. I love that!

Some of my favorite items to order include the Gravy Fries. They have a brown or white gravy. I really love the brown. Coupled with the super crisp fries the gravy is a perfect salty/savory kick. I have gotten their Club Sandwich which is huge!! I always get it with rye bread. (They don't list it as a side option, but if you ask you can order a side salad instead of their other choices.) The Pesto Chicken sandwich on focaccia is full of flavor and the chicken was moist and not over cooked. Also, I really enjoy their regular house salad. Joel loves their Baked Ziti. If you love pasta this place has a weekly pasta special. They also serve breakfast ALL day on Sundays.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back. You can choose to sit in the restaurant part or the bar area. You can get the specials no matter where you sit. 

This place is a winner for me. Great food and tasty drinks. They need maybe one more waitress on busy days. The one they have is super friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back to try something else off their tasty menu!"}

We had planned to go to Bistro Pizza and were on the way to a show on the strip but missed the detail that Bistro is closed on Tuesday's.  My son, planner and navigator who missed the Tuesday detail quickly came up with Henry's as it was pretty close and well rated on Yelp.  Very lucky for us... and him.  The food was tasty, generous and served hot and fast.  And did I mention well priced.  I had a drink and it was a healthy pour.  We ate in the restaurant side, the bar looked a bit sketchy.  My son had a burger that was huge and I am a club sandwich fan so went that route.  I am a big guy but could not get my mouth over a quartered hunk of that sandwich.  The only reason they aren't a 5 star is the decor and that the sandwiches were out of scale.  Server was very nice, great food, well priced and pretty easy to find.  Give it a try if you are looking for good pub grub or comfort food and don't need the restaurant chain overlay."}

The menu is HUGE! Breakfast, lunch, dinner, munchies? They have it!

We decided to try different things and share it-- we got Gravy Fries, World's Best Mac N Cheese, Curry Pasta, Ham Steak, and Cinnamon Texas French Toast!

Just like their menu, their portions are HUGE!!!! Seriously recommend if there's a choice for big or small-- choose the small! 
Their prices are very reasonable!
Kind of reminds me of Hash House portions but this shits on Hash House!

Definitely a recommend!"}

The cheaper burger doesn't come with a side but fries are only $2.50.  The onion rings and fries were great.  My wife had the Reuben and, while it was very tasty, the meat could have been sliced a bit thinner.  Beers were cheap at $3.75 for domestic but I think this place really needs to have a happy hour.

After a nice long afternoon and evening slumber and a few TV episodes, I was pretty famished. It was well past midnight, and I had just the place in mind: Henry's.

Upon entering the anteroom, I saw the sign to hit the doorbell if the inner door was locked, so I did that and smiled for the camera (look up and to the right). The door clicked and I walked in. I saw the restaurant to the left and a bar to the right, where seemingly everybody was. Since I didn't feel like eating my food through the stench of cigarette smoke, I sat on the restaurant side.

The late night menu was exciting to see. Available from midnight until 7am, it offers a decent array of options including a couple breakfast options, some nachos, salads, and soup. I was destined to get the burger, however, and opted for the $1.99 hamburger. Couldn't justify adding $1 for a $2.99 cheeseburger, even if it would have been that much yummier. Also got the crunchy fries for $1 and added an "appetizer" of two garlic parm chicken fingers, learning later that it's actually $1.00 for each finger even though the menu says to order by twos.

I was still a little hazy with the passage of time and such, but it probably took 10-15 minutes. For all I cared, it could've taken half an hour and I wouldn't have been too concerned, given a prior experience at a late night place. It just so happened that one moment I was looking at my phone, and the next I saw three red plastic trays on the counter at the kitchen. The cook soon asked me if those were my items, given that the only other guy was still in the bar. I indicated as such and he brought the trays out to me.

FOOD! Oh yes, I had waited for this, and I was ready to enjoy it. I grabbed a chicken finger first, and I noticed it was still hot, and oh so greasy. A little too greasy. I later saw a huge pool of oil at the bottom of the paper and got just a little freaked out. I think the fingers were a little overdone, but they were still pretty good. The complementary ranch definitely helped out. Grease aside, there's so much meat here for $1 that you'd be doing yourself a disservice going anywhere else during these hours.

The burger was a treat. There's lettuce, grilled onions, tomato, slightly too many pickle slices, and a special sauce that I couldn't tell you much about except that it was delicious. The burger was well done, but you can't win every single time I guess. I just have no idea how you're going to beat this value for $1.99.

The fries were also ridiculously good. They're cut pretty thick, floured a bit, and reportedly brined before frying, and they were just super fluffy and maintained that outer crunch throughout the night. And they sure lasted that long since the order is so dang huge! You can easily share this between 2 or even 3 people, but I braved the pile as a loner. They actually held up flavor-wise too until the last handful, where I finally asked the cook for the ketchup. Probably should've asked for the ketchup even earlier, but I was too stubborn.

I've only eaten out a few times after midnight, but it still shouldn't have taken years for me to visit this place. Henry's was one of those places that I'd heard about for a little while but hadn't bothered to visit. Now, it's one of those places that I'd love to visit again and again if I'm ever awake at the proper time."}

I guess that's a good way to start this review.   So, I'm out in Hendo doing some shopping and  was getting a bit hungry.   I had heard some good words about Henry's from a guy at work so I figured I'd track it down.   I'm my opinion it's a bit hard to spot because it's located in a shopping plaza and the only signage is on the doors (at least what I could see). You have to know what you're looking for to spot it.  One side is a bar (with machines) which is closed off from the restaurant side.   I did my eating in the restaurant.   Very spacious and clean with four tvs to keep you busy.   The staff (Kimmy) was very pleasant and very helpful with the menu.  Additionally,  I ordered iced tea and not only did she bring me a full glass, she brought a mini pitcher full as well  The pizza,  bbq, and burgers get good reviews so I decided to go burger today.   The Farm Burger to be exact.   Sweet 6lb Baby Jesus, how big should a burger be?!  Two beef patties, fried egg, bacon, plus the normal veggies with  a side of slaw.   Very  very tasty!!  And not crazy expensive.   I think I rounded out at around $12.  I decided to write my review while I'm in the restaurant, cuz I can't move at the moment  Try it,  you'll love it."}

There is just something about the colors and decor or maybe even the word fonts themselves that make me almost shriek. I've driven by the place a million times over the past 8 years and never went in. Thought I'd give it a try after reading reviews here.
 First time we went we got pot roast and a bleu cheese burger. Consider yourself warned, this burger is HUGE, and I think it's real meat not cheaper filler. This was made with two heavy patties and a bleu cheese sauce and waffle fries were good too. The pot roast comes with potatoes, carrots and a fresh roll. It was so tender you could cut it with a fork.
Went a few more times and tried soups and pastas. The pasta was exotic and different.
 The clam chowder was excellent. The turkey soup was good but slightly cold, all I had to do was send it back and I didn't bother asking.
 The waitresses are nice and attentive.
 If you ask for coffee you get a carafe, if you ask for water you get a pitcher. 
 We enjoyed lunch items, haven't tried pizza yet. We didn't dig the onion rings too much they too thick and the breading fell off making them kinda pointless.
 We tried the breakfast and it was OK. I think we ordered wrong for what we wanted, we got omelette's and the toast was cold and hard ( in their defense we are having a cold spell here and it was cold in there in general so hot toast wasn't gonna happen despite any efforts), The eggs were OK, nothing special, same with the hash browns. Then after we ate the waitress showed us the eggs and pancakes order someone else got and we were covetous... OK.. next time!! That plate looked to be more up our alley and a better deal. There are a few affordable breakfast items but some are over priced. If they served a cheap breakfast 24 hours I'd bet their clientele would beef up.
 We haven't done much dinner here or pasta, never tried that. Overall its very good American food, most items are a decent or big portion. The prices are kinda all over the place but you get options too like with the pasta special you can order a 1/2 portion for 1/2 price or you can get a single burger for less. 
 I think like anywhere else you just have to know what to order. If I could go up to 3 1/2 stars in the rating I would."}

We walked in and seated ourselves (hoping that was proper etiquette) in some rather spacious, long booths. The one front of house staff person delivered some tables' food, then brought us menus.

Perusing their offerings, I decided to give their "World's Best Mac & Cheese" a try. Since I wanted more than just cheesy pasta, I added the chicken option.

With our glasses of water, the server also brought out a small pitcher of water for us, which was nice to have handy!

Let's put it this way, one pound of mac and cheese, with a chicken breast makes for a HUGE plate of food to see appear before one's self. My wife and I both took exploratory bites of the pound of cheesy mac. It was....

...

Barely mediocre. 

The cheese was not very flavorful, there was an abundance of melted, yellow cheese throughout. 

The chicken was... well, it started out as chicken. It was grilled on an open flame, so the outside was charred pretty good and the inside was half dry and tough, half almost moist. There was no flavor beyond charcoal.

$16 for a pound of mediocre mac and cheese, with a burnt chicken breast? I think this place will not be getting my business again for a while.

My wife will review her food, as it was equally (or more) underwhelming than this dish."}

Touted as an American grill, they certainly have a lot to choose from. Pizzas, burgers and sandwiches are among the many, many menu choices. I had the Honey Fried Chicken salad with sliced apples and toasted almonds on my last visit. I know this isn't a NEW concept for a dinner salad, but I did enjoy that the breading on the chicken had a sweet honey flavor. It really went well with the honey mustard dressing.

All fountain drinks that you order always end up coming with a small pitcher on the side that will probably fill your drink two more times. Some would call this a lazy practice so the wait staff doesn't have to refill drinks, I think of it as a thoughtful touch.

They also have an extensive breakfast menu. I've only had the corned beef hash, which was delicious and plentiful. 

They have a sports bar feel going on, as there are a few TV's situated around with sports playing. I wouldn't say it isn't kid friendly at all.

Bottom line, reasonable prices, HUGE portions, great variety and good staff. I'd recommend Henry's for a causal meal with friends."}

I live close by and thought I would try this spot for some wings. Service was kind of slow, which was odd cause it was nor very crowded. However the waitress was really nice and the place was clean. I decided I go with the garlic Parmesan wings, because those are usually amazing. I got my wings and was dissatisfied, there was no sauce or seasoning. The wings were breaded and cooked just right but had no flavor. Might need to stop by again to give them another chance."}

If you are in the area around the Galleria Mall or DMV, this is a nice meal stop.
The club and "Hank" sandwiches are solid, and you will need a to-go box.

This is one of my favorite places for comfort food which Frank takes a TON of pride in the quality and taste of the food.  If you get something here you do not like, let them know and they will fix it, however finding something that does not taste good will be hard.

The burgers are fresh ground with the highest quality meats that are made in house and the prices for the burgers are better then most places.

If you like alcohol type drinks, the bartenders are amazing and make some really good drinks and again the price is better then some happy hours.  Stop in and grab a bite, you will not be disappointed...."}

We went in last night and it was not packed when we got there, actually only one other table but within 30 minutes that place was packed.  Even with all the customers, the kitchen still delivered and no one left disappointed that I saw.

The BLT is the best in town, its the bacon that makes it and they know how to make it.  The salad was a little disappointing but like the head chef said last night, good lettuce even the organic kind is hard to come by right now.  We have noticed at the farmers markets that the same is true.

Other then that, the drinks are cheap and amazing, best bartendar's in town. 

A table next to us ordered chicken fingers which I have never had hear but from what I heard they are the best, so one day I may have to stray from the wings to the finger which may be hard but I may have to try it.

I wanted to give this place a  better review, but in good conscience I can't recommend this place. I'll get to that, but a few good things to point out first.

The pulled pork sandwich was good, but they didn't toast the bun. So the sauce and the juice from the pork just turned it into inedible mush. But! Some pork on the fries with some cheese and jalapeños would have been awesome. Or just toast the bun. 

My wife liked her turkey sandwich dinner thing. Hot turkey sandwich or something. Normally served open face, but here they don't do that. 

Here's where the 1 star comes from: Ordered chicken wings. They were ICE cold in the middle. Hot on the outside, FREEZING on the inside. She offered to have them remade which I was fine with, but the second batch came out rubbery. So this tells me they aren't properly cooking and/or thawing the chicken. It's gonna get someone sick and even though I liked the pulled pork and the fries and my wife liked her turkey I can't suggest to you to go here if they can't cook wings safely. 

Our waitress was wonderful, the bar area was nice ( a little Smokey but not too bad. Didn't bother my wife with asthma). They had TV's but smaller ones so it was ok for watching a game but not ideal. 

Had the wings not been getting people sick would have gone 3 maybe 4 stars. But I doubt those bad food handling habits are isolated to just their wings."}

The overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke had a negative effect on our appetites and we couldn't do the portions justice.

The mac and cheese is excellent! It comes in a huge portion that's good for 2-3 people to share or plenty for you to take home. You can get it with jalapeno too! I would give it 4 stars but the -1 is because the prices have increased. The mac and cheese was taken off the very cheap late night menu!

The bartender is my absolute favorite. He is such a great, friendly guy and can make anybody feel like a regular here. He makes great mixed drinks and has good recommendations. He really knows his stuff and makes this bar a special place!"}

I highly recommend getting the Garlic Parmesan on them. The Chocolate shake there was also fantastic! Plus our server Kristen made the experience great.

Haven't been to Henry's in years, liked it the first time i went there so why not ?

I was a lil miffed waiting a few minutes after being seated before our drink orders taken ( place not that busy ) even more miffed that after we ordered our food, two other couples come into the place, seated,  orders taken AND they get their food before we do !

The food ?

GF ordered a veggie omelet ( after the list of veggies ordered along with egg white - cost $11.50) - it was a sorry looking omelet - small, browned to imperfection and the veggies were greasy ( she asked for no oil ) 

I went with the pot roast hash ( i believe it cost $10.95 ) - although a little on the greasy side, the hash was pretty tasty.  But a major ding that my eggs ( requested over easy ) came out with firm yolks.  bummer.

GF liked that with my diet coke order, they brought over a "mini-pitcher"  of DC so no need to ask for refills.

The slow service and piss poor omelet means no future visits.

Our server approached us quickly for our drink order and returned swiftly with our drinks and carafes for each of us. As someone who requires lots of refills, I was a fan of this. 

Everything on the menu looked great so it took a while to figure out what we wanted. Our server helped us out by letting us know what her favorites on the menu were. She also explained that everything is made from scratch, so I was already excited about our meal.

My friend ordered the Savannah burger with waffle fries and I ordered the fried shrimp with crispy fries and cole slaw. The food came out and it was delicious. My friend's burger was enormous and despite his hearty appetite was only able to finish half before throwing in the towel. My shrimp was tasty and fresh.

The $19 burgers in the casinos are starting to take a toll on me, literally, so coming across the $4.99(!) burger at Henry's American Grill in Henderson was exciting and promised big things based on all the Yelp comments. And although I had a couple complaints as I always do, this turned out to be a good visit.

Henry's is located deep in Henderson in a typical strip of retail, and seems like every other bar from the outside. And honestly it's not very fancy or different on the inside either, but this is what to expect of a local pub, you're not really going for the ambiance. I went at lunchtime but the restaurant side was completely empty and didn't even look open so I ventured to the stinky bar side. I sat down at one of the high tops away from the bar, but I wish someone could have told me the restaurant side was indeed open because I was the only person out of a handful not smoking. There were a few regulars drinking at the bar around noon, and it seemed like a friendly local spot.

The menu has typical pub faire; pizza, burgers, salad, supposedly a decent breakfast...but I was there for the burgers that many locals have claimed to be the best in town. They offer a handful of 'specialty burgers' including a Bourbon BBQ, Mushroom Bleu Cheese, Southwestern, Nacho and a couple others, but the stars of the menu are the $3.99 Hamburger and $4.99 Cheeseburger, both with' the works.' They even tout this on their menu as an "awesome burger at an awesome price." For sides you have some interesting choices: freedom fries, coleslaw, pasta salad, jasmine rice or fresh fruit. I've heard some great things about the bleu cheese cream sauce, but I had to see if the $4.99 awesome burger really was as claimed.

The verdict? For $4.99 it's pretty damn good. The meat has really great char flavor, and just good meat flavor overall. My medium-rare burger came out as ordered, and my cheese was melted. The bun was good, it got a tiny bit soggy from the juiciness of the burger but held together. The special sauce really wasn't too noticeable until one of my bites near the end, almost a red relish kind of sauce that tasted pretty good and made me wish it was a little more present sooner. This wasn't an overly fancy burger that you'd find at Burger Bar or Bachi, but it was really good.

And of course I'm never completely happy, as the fries were really not good. I'm getting really tired of the fries being the one aspect that brings down my meal; they're such an important yet neglected part of a burger meal. They looked like they could be good, but just didn't have any great flavor to them and were a bit soggy for my taste. I have no doubt that I would give this overall meal a much higher score if I were happier about the fries. At $4.99 this is a really great deal, combined with some amazing fries and it could become a really special gem off the strip for burger lovers. It's still definitely worth the price as maybe the fries are sometimes inconsistent? Either way, check it out based on the price alone."}

I instead noshed on the decadent sweet potato puffs (deep fried perfectly) and the gilled prime rib sandwich with my guest - who, btw, loved the sandwich. I was not a fan because I couldn't get past the undertones of ancho seasoning - which haunted me until I dissected my sandwich to thoroughly figure out what I tasted. Beyond the misfit of seasoning, the sandwich was fine and paired well with the (properly seasoned) pasta salad. Onion rings were on par...but, again, I need to stress how delicious the sweet potato puffs are and cutely served in a lil' metal basket!!

The menu is several pages of comfort food, the booths are big and could fit 6 people, they offer 24/hr. service, and beverages in big glasses...our server even placed a carafe of iced tea at our table which was a nice touch. Service was prompt and enthusiastic. Very clean place with an open kitchen area that was spotless!

I will return soon; can't wait to stroll in here with the hubs on a lazy Saturday when he is craving gravy fries or a hot turkey sandwich! Henry's will be the perfect fit!"}

We live in the GVR/Anthem area and it was a short drive from our house. Less than 15 mins. For the first visit, I wanted to get take-out. I actually TIMED them with a stop watch app on my phone. They had my order ready within 8 minutes! :)

SETTING/THEME: First off, I've seen many people complain about the "darkness" of the place. Well, as it turns out I think it looks GREAT and I love low lighted settings (think Outback SteakHouse or Red Lobster). Bright, sunlit places actually annoy me because I'm squinting my eyes the whole time. They have the restaurant and gaming/bar sections separated by solid walls and a dark tinted black door, which I felt was a nice touch and clever. The restaurant section was one really big room with good distance between tables so no one would EVER feel crowded. All the furnishings were made of soft, light colored, polished wood with plenty of padded booths and tables for 4 available.

CROWD: Personally, I wish more young people would explore their food options. There are so many wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas and it seems the only people who know about these wonderful places are senior citizens and "foodies" like me. This place has a staff of waitresses in their 40s+. There were 3 senior citizen couples there as customers eating in. They all must've been at least 50+.

WHAT I ORDERED: 2 double cheeseburgers with bleu cheese and "the works" + 1 order of fries.

COST: $17.60 total. They were a tad bit expensive. If they would drop all their prices just $1, they would OWN this valley!
 
FOOD: The burgers were clearly hand crafted and well seasoned 100% real beef. The patties were huge. I would compare them to Five Guys Burgers and Fries, both the burgers and the fries. However, Henry's American Grill's patties are slightly bigger than Five Guys'. the burgers were delicious. 

The fries were home cooked style regular sized seasoned fries. I prefer light crispy shoestring fries myself so the fries here seemed sub-par to me.

The one thing I found disappointing was that I ordered blue cheese and they only gave me a small dab of bleu cheese. I would've expected 3-4 dabs for that price. If I had ordered American, Swiss, or any other cheese, you would have given me a full slice. So, why is it when I order Bleu Cheese, you give me 1/4 of the amount of cheese I would normally get?

CHANCE OF RETURN: Definitely! They have some great stuff on their menu I'd like to try. Like the whiskey glazed bread pudding,. and pulled pork sandwiches.

BTW. Tommy the late night bartender is a solid dude.

The food is decent, but the portions are good sized so you feel you get value for your money. But yesterday was a different story. My rueben sandwich was 1/4 the size of anywhere else. Mostly though? The service was the main problem. Our waitress, Alicia, was great. The cooks on the other hand were terrible . My guest is a type 1 diabetic and had just taken her injection right before we entered. She has to eat soon after her shot. I was recovering from a fractured pelvic bone, so sitting in one spot is painful. My 3rd guest was my friends husband. We had to wait over 30 minutes for a hamburger, a reuben and an omelette. Our waitress asked the cooks 2 times for our order. I watched her get berated for her efforts. Later. I complained to Dina, the bartender, an  asst. Manager? And she pretended to listen. I won't go back again. If you have any health issues and need to eat in a timely fashion? Go somewhere else!"}

Decided on Henry's since we were close by and there was no wait. It's an interesting set up with an enclosed bar on one side and the "restaurant" on the other. There are booths and the sides and sort of communal tables in the middle. 

We were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken right away. I ordered "The Hank" which is a prime rib sandwich with grilled peppers and onions. Once the food arrived the service ended. The sandwich was very salty and the prime rib had a good amount of fat in it (even for prime rib). I kept biting in to large pieces of fat. 

The sweet potato tots (or puffs as they call them) were okay, nothing great. The waitress never returned. We had to flag her down for a to go box, again for the check, and again to take the check. I would categorize Henry's as bar food and not much more. Its great that its open 24 hours so if your looking for a late night snack this might do the trick. For dinner though I would look elsewhere."}

We stopped in for a Saturday lunch.  It wasn't very busy so we were seated immediately.   Our drinks were brought out in a flash.  The neat idea they have is bringing a mini pitcher for your refills.  You mean I don't have to wait for my refill or flag down the waitress? Love it.  The menu is very extensive.  There is such a variety of meals to choose from including breakfast items.   From pizza to pot roast to a burger... they've got you covered.  

A nachos appetizer?  That has Bethany written all over it!  With toppings of cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños and chili, it was surely a winner.  It seemed like no time passed before our nachos were sitting in front of us.  They had a great flavor with salsa and sour cream served on the side.  I'd definitely get these again.

For our entree we split the Pesto Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  It was great!  The warm rosemary focaccia bread enclosed the juicy grilled chicken breast. The melted cheese and roasted red peppers gave it an extraordinary flavor. My husband did like the rosemary flavor... but not loved it like I did.  We all have different tastes.  Crispy french fries were served on the side ~ a great compliment to the sandwich.   I saw they offered sweet potato puffs on the side...  Sure!  Why not?! They were good but not great.  A little too soggy in the middle.  I would suggest sticking with the fries. 

Phenomenal service from Lori! She was an absolute delight!  It just makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.   

They are a 24/7 bar and grill so I foresee us stopping in again for sure.  Can't wait to try more on the menu!"}

Dropped in here to grab a late breakfast, but they stopped serving at 11am. So I went with a lunch plate, chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, peas, and a roll ($11), along with an iced tea ($1.99).

Located in a shopping mall area off Stephanie, you walk in and get the choice of dining in a clean, bright dining area, or heading into the bar area which is a bit darker and smokier. Its a nice menu of comfort foods. Plenty of selection.

Now to the little things that make it a nice meal. Pleasant service and frequent check backs. Ice tea in a glass, and in a 32 oz pitcher for refills. Butter that isn't frozen but soft and easily spreadable. A steak knife that wasn't necessary because the chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly and you could cut with a fork. Portion sizes that are plenty. 

Very solid choice if you want a good meal, pleasant service, fair prices. I'll be back."}

We shared a prime rib sandwich that was also very yummy and also shared a Ruben that was a bit too salty in my opinion. We ordered the waffle fries with both sandwiches. Overall good food.

Fries were pretty good and for it being essentially a sports bar (they had the Olympics on) I would normally have given this a much higher rating. The service was good, great almost. Problem was my bartender seemed a little bit off, which is something I am used to in Las Vegas. He did take longer to bring me the check then the food- next time I will ask ahead of time I think.... Lastly, and this is a big one.... I didn't get asked a temperature on my burger.

Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs: We lucked out and arrived late on a Sunday, so breakfast was still being served... and we totally scored! The Chicken Fried Steak is made IN HOUSE! No pre-made garbage here! So perfectly cooked it didn't even need a knife. And the sausage gravy was flavorful and totally complimented the Chicken Fried Steak. The eggs were cooked to perfection.  The hash-browns were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  Coming from Texas, we KNOW what a superb Chicken Fried Steak is supposed to taste like... And this one would give even the best in Texas a run for its money. Absolutely the best Chicken Fried Steak meal we've ever had in Vegas, hands down.  

BLT Club: can you say bacon-bacon-bacon?! They do NOT skimp on the bacon! It was so big, I could barely wrap my mouth around it! The sourdough was toasted wonderfully... Just overall an awesome sandwich served w super yummy waffle fries.

Best Bleu Cheese Burger in Vegas. It's not just a little bit of bleu cheese throw onto a burger. There's bleu cheese mixed with happiness to create an amazing cream sauce concoction that makes my heart ache with every bite. If only I could make a bleu cheese sauce that delicious. They also have a Farm Burger and Nacho Burger that put my boyfriend down for the happy food coma coma. Good quality ingredients in a solid bun that somehow keeps up with all the messiness.

Their Garlic and Rosemary Chicken is fantastic. Tender, never overcooked, savory and filling in every way possible. The mashed potatoes on the side are mediocre, but who needs potatoes when there's a scrumptious chicken to devour?

Henry's is a 24 hour restaurant, and they have a GREAT late night menu. Everything is $5 and the best bang for your buck. The late night cheeseburger is equally delicious after 12AM. They have the standards, 2 eggs, hash browns and toast, but the star of this menu is the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. The smells of this sandwich followed me to the restaurant when it was in front of my boyfriend in the bar section. Great sauce, tender pork, great seasoning. It comes with plenty of fries that are crispy, well seasoned and not disappointing in any way.

To top it all off, they have mini-desserts, including a hot fudge sundae that proves sometimes you need a little sweetness at the end of every meal.

Definitely stop by here for a quick bite. Even though not everything on the menu is as good as the next, overall this restaurant has great quality for a perfect price. Top it off with consistently fantastic service and you've got a deal."}

Food: 4

Blackened Chicken Quesadilla: This quesadilla comes loaded with chicken and fried to a crisp on the outside. The salsa isn't spicy, but it adds a nice touch of acidity and heat. The guacamole was decent, but I definitely wished I got a bigger portion when I paid $1.50 for it.

Service: 4.5

As far as I could tell, there was a lone waiter manning the restaurant during lunch time. It's not super busy, so that's alright. However, it does become hard for him to manage if there are more than a couple tables, and it took awhile for us to get our checks.

That said, he was awesome in making separate checks for each person even though the restaurant's policy clearly stated that group of 12+ people could not get separate checks.

Ambiance: 3.5

The grill has a restaurant and bar clearly divided by a glass wall. The restaurant has the feel of a typical older diner. It's a little dark and dated, but it seems decently clean."}

He would be drunk off his ass and very rude to the females inside to the point he would ran them off and whats worse is the bartender tommy would allow it to happen. Tommy would never kick out adam out due the fact they are friends. I would even move away from adam to another machine and he would flip out on me across the bar and tommy wouldn't kick his ass out. The only bartender that ever kicked adam out was MARY.. she stond  up for us females against adam when adam was telling me to go die already from my cancer however she got fired and tommy took a picture of her report of the event and sent to adams cell... who shouldn't been fired here ? I will never come back to this bar ever another due to the two facts.. they allowed adam to come back after how he treats female players and mary was fried when it should be tommy. Tommy has allowed this to go on for so long and then to take a pic of her report and sent it to adam is to me grounds of being fired.

We were here during late lunch hours, like 2-3pm.  The menu looked like there was a lot of options that sounded good, but since it was still lunch for us I went with a simple chicken strip meal with fries.  I was going to order 4  chicken strips for my kid, but the nice waitress strongly suggested I go smaller because according to her the chicken strips were huge.  OK, she was NOT lying!!!  We got 6 total for me and my son to share.  These could not be classified as strips, they were like 6 huge chicken breasts and they were cripspy on the outside and very tasty.  My wife ordered a mushroom blueu cheese burger.  Her burger looked amazing (although I do not like mushrooms or blueu cheese).  There was so much bleue cheese sauce and mushrooms all over the place.  In my opinion, better to have too much on it than not enough.  She was thoroughly satisfied with her meal.  I could spend 10 minutes ranting and raving about the fries alone.  They were thick, but yet very crispy on the ouside.  I am not sure what they use, if it's some kind of batter on the fries or what, but I love the crispy texture while maintaining the excellent mushy potato insides.  They also have waffle fries which I will want to try on a future visit.  The waitress was very kind, and patient with us.  We took our time looking over the menu and asking her questions.  They have about 10 sauce flavors to choose from for the wings/fingers.  I tried one my wife thought I might like, but of course I ended up not liking that one..lol.  In the end I settled with the hottest flavor they offer which was pretty darn hot, and I mixed it with a standard hot buffalo sauce for the perfect blend for me.  I did not go into the bar because I was with family and I don't do the bar scene anyways.  Ive also heard it is very smokey in there, but the dinning area was clean and nice.  They have TV's to watch sports or whatever.  Some may think the price is a bit spendy, but considering the size and quality of the food, I was happy with the cost.  I think for the 3 family members, we spent around $30 which isn't bad at all.  That includes our sodas.  I will be coming back to try some of the dinner options, burgers, and nachos at least.  I definetly recommend this place to anyone who might be in the area.  Also, just wanted to mention, it wasn't that busy when I was there.  Only 1-2 other groups of customers at any point while I was there."}

I initially scoped this place out because they served open faced hot roast beef sandwiches which hardly anyone serves up anymore. My husband was happy that I found this place and the gravy laden mashed potatoes and tender beef satisfied his taste buds and tummy. I like the bourbon glazed carrots that comes with it myself as well! 

Mooching off Mr. B's plate: Gravy Fries! - only resto I know that serves it lunch dinner breakfast time.  Either brown gravy or country gravy smothered on french fries. It's good, but a little too salty for my taste.

The Bourbon BBQ Burger is another favorite that is ordered. Mr. B goes on and on how it's the best!(better than Fatburger)  The burger seasoned and juicy, comes with bacon and a bourbon sauce. 

Lunch favorites- Baked garlic chicken wings topped with shredded Parmesan cheese , Sweet potato tots, deep fried, crisp out, moist inside. Mushroom burger with blue cheese cream sauce, it's different twist on a mushroom burger, I like how they smother the Burger in the sauce. You need a fork and knife though to eat it.  The turkey wrap with turkey, bacon and cranberry cream cheese and alfalfa sprouts is nice for a lighter lunch. 

The Southern Stack for breakfast or 2am cravings..Cornbread topped with sausage patties, eggs over easy and smothered in a hamburger gravy ...think the Southern version of the Hawaiian Loco Moco ;) Prime Rib dinner on Thursday nights! Dessert I have yet to order. 

The atmosphere, family friendly, laid back & casual, come in your shorts, sweats, (and dare I say roll in your pj's in the AM?) Just walk in and seat yourself.  Main room of restaurant is larger. Clean, never too crowded.  Boothes can seat 4 people comfortably, table seating can accommodate larger parties.  Bar area is separated by wall and closed doors. It reeks of cigarettes but that is expected. There are smaller boothes to dine set against wall. Late nights you have to get buzzed in. This place has been here since the strip mall opened and has outlasted many of the shops that have come and gone.
 
Service has always been spot on at all times even in the bar area.  Always friendly, they get our orders right even with the special requests we ask for. Drinks always filled. We're never rushed out of there.  It's not outstanding, oh-my-goodness kind of food by all means, but it does not disappoint and it's affordable.  Cant go wrong with that!"}

Do you use trans fat free oil?? Yes!! Perfect, I'm in. The cool part is the inside. Modern look and cozy atmosphere. They have one side restaurant and the other side is bar, some bar machines and tables. The menu is straight up COMFORT food. They specialize in American Fusion. From their Famous Mac n Cheese, Pot Roast Sandwich with Buttery Mash Potatoes and bourbon glazed carrots, Citrus Marinated Chicken Fingers from Scratch with up to 12 sauces to try. Incredible selection of hand made burgers and fresh made pizza. Interesting to say the least. They have a Cheeseburger Pizza with mustard, ketchup, onions, pickles, burger, lettuce and tomato. Im sure thats whats in it, can't remember since I don't have the menu in front of me lol. Someone had ordered it across from us and it looked freaking good. The Nacho Burger was amazing. Big hand made beef patty, grilled to perfection, topped with black olives, jalapeños, tortilla chips, nacho cheese sauce on a toasted bun with Freedom Fries. Gooey goodness on a perfectly cooked beef patty. The Blackened Chicken Sandwich was spectacular. Marinated and blackened seasoned Chicken breast on a toasted wheat bun, topped with pineapple salsa, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions and served with Freedom Fries. The Fries are so crispy and perfectly seasoned with their own special seasoning salt. They definitely make you addicted. I felt like a pig after devouring everything and wanting more fries. But I resisted lol. The chicken fingers were AMAZING!!! Fresh chicken fillets that are marinated in Citrus. Then freshly hand battered and fried perfectly crisp. The sauces to choose from range from mild to Nuclear hot. They even have a caption no refunds if its to hot lol. I prefer Buffalo Hot cuz I iove the flavor or an authentic buffalo wing. I can go on and on. The menu is definitely something try and enjoy. Can't wait to try some of their pastas and comfort food selections. Until next time, LET'S EAT!!!!"}

Henry's is a place that just simply gets it when it comes down to making a perfect hamburger or for any sandwich for that matter. They are spot on all their menu items.  To start, their menu is an eclectic display of the American menu - burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas and breakfasts.  I haven't had a meal I didn't like there.  My two favorites are their burgers and their Prime Rib sandwich called 'The Hank'.  This is a must sandwich everyone needs to try one time - request it medium rare.  Believe me, it's the perfect blend of flavors mixed in with the cheese, green bell peppers and onions.  On top of that adding another layer of flavors when you dip it in the au jus, totally tantalizing the tastebuds.

Although, most folks may think it's bar food.  The restaurant side is family friendly - it's simple and service is timely."}

Walking in, we noticed it was quiet for a Saturday afternoon (lunch hour) but they had a few families enjoying meals here so that was a good sign. They decorated for Halloween which we liked, makes it feel welcoming. Also noticed they have a lot of specials posted on the boards up front and they sounded pretty good on top of the fact there are specials every day of the week. 

We sat at a small booth side table and within a few minutes we were greeted by Morgan. She was great! Very sweet, gave us time to check the menu and was very attentive. Brought us our drinks and mini pitchers for refills, good move because bae constantly needs refills, lol! 

Food: We started with a bowl of their Baked Potato Soup to share. Morgan was not kidding when she said to be ready for the best soup! It was amazing. Awesome portion, great flavor, hearty and chunky. We're looking forward to trying other options once the weather cools down! 
We ordered the country fried steak meal with mashed potatoes and veggies and the blackened chicken sandwich sub onion bun and with the waffle fries.
The country fried steak was tender, meaty and has the right amount of crunch and the gravy complimented the mash and veggies well too. The meal also came with a dinner roll and a cinnamon/spice spread that was so good (even dipped the fries into it.) Definitely recommend if you like a good southern inspired meal. 
The blackened chicken sandwich was well seasoned and juicy, and the pineapple salsa alongside it was a fresh compliment to the blackened spices. 

If you're looking for a relaxed, casual local spot check this place out. 

Looking forward to stopping in again and trying other options on their menu!"}

The quality of their food is incredible given it's a poker bar that is smoky as all hell. 

I recently snagged a Turkey Club at 2am on a Monday. It came with sweet potato tater tots. I couldn't believe how fresh the turkey was; it was carved (seemingly fresh) and NOT processed. The sweet potato tots tasted fresh, too -- not from a larger food service distributor. 

The bar is smoky and the service can be a little slow. It's definitely a place for regulars. That said, you can call in a take-out order 24 hours a day and get a truly quality meal. 

As far as I'm concerned: Henry's is a gem. 

(Note: If you're a video poker player, their pay tables are not ideal. However, I imagine that's where the great happy hour, and reasonable prices come into play)"}

My family of 4 tried this place on a Sunday early afternoon.  The place was not crowded, but walking in we weren't sure whether to seat ourselves or wait.  So after a minute of waiting, we just decided to sit down.  It took awhile to get menus or a drink order although the waitress did acknowledge us after we got seated.  She was very friendly and once we were finally waited on, the service was great.

The food was good - portions were enormous!  My daughter had the mac and cheese which she loved (it had roasted red peppers in it which was yummy).  I had a nacho burger. I liked it, but it was so sloppy it shouldn't have come with a bun.  In fact, I ended up eating it with a fork and leaving the bun on the plate.  I think any of the other burgers would have been better - the burger itself was good but the flavors of the "nacho" toppings did nothing for me.

I like that they bring out little pitchers of soda so you don't have to wait for refills.  I don't know why, but that was kind of cool. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. The décor was not memorable but for a family meal in a diner like this, we didn't come here for the décor.

I was very surprised by the openness of the place, the portion of my meal and the quality of the food. 

For me, I like mom and pop places, non-corporate and non chain food places.  I like to eat at places that are different so that when people come to town, we aren't always going to Denny's, I-hop, Olive Garden etc.  That so happened to be the case when my family visited and wanted to eat somewhere new.  I took them to Henry's and my brother commented that this was just the place he was looking for.  Good comfort food, great quality and great value.  I had a HAHA moment when we ordered french fries, and our server said they don't serve french fries. because being an "American Grill" there is no such thing.  Instead, they offer freedom fries...see HAHA.  8-)

Quick tip/tidbit of info - it's open 24 hours a day, and they offer free mints at the front.  These aren't your typical peppermints - they are chocolate mints.  Like Andes chocolate from olive garden, but you can get more than just 1, and it's hard so it lasts longer.  Aside from the overall greatness, it's the little things that make me a repeat customer."}

The pulled pork sandwich and waffle fries are a classic combo, and you can order many things on the menu past midnight and the bill will rarely go past $10 because of their late-night deals. Their pulled-pork sandwich is made just right with tender pork and soft bread. The waffle fries are your everyday fries and you can mix them in with your sandwich for a one-way ticket to no-regrets guilty eating.

The staff is friendly as you cant find past midnight, but the place itself has a cigarette aroma because of the bar next door.  The service is slow, but I bring study materials to work on while I wait for my food.

I had the Mac & Cheese Dog which was delicious - it needs to have a little added but that is dependent on taste . . .a little salt . . . a little hot sauce.   The Mt. Fuji is not to be missed.  Next time in I'm going for the Carolina Slaw Dog and/or but most probably and the PBB&JJ dog.   

There are tater tots, crinkle fries and onion rings to go with the dogs. Over 50 kinds of cold vintage sodas, seating and a smiling staff.

The owner is engaging and fun to speak with. Without a restaurant to their name they dived into this creation and  I'm a fan.  The menu is diverse, the dogs are unusual and good, the place is fun and we will return often!"}

Will be sure to try the tater tots on our next trip.  Very quick and friendly service!"}

Met a friend here for dinner one day to try it out as it recently opened.  The menu was decent sized, so I asked the cashier (whom I think was also the owner) which items were most popular. He gave me statistics on his top 5 dogs, which I was impressed with.

I ended up with the Mac n Cheese dog and I also asked for tittle bacon wrapped. Yes please!  My friend ordered a dog and also the loaded tots. We sat down and waited for out order and when it was ready, someone brought it out to us. I don't think this was normal, but since there wasn't very many people in the shop they seemed very accommodating. 

I cannot tell you how good my hotdog was! The dog itself tasted like a sausage, not a ball park hotdog.  Plus the crispy bacon took it to a whole other level.  The mac and cheese topping was so cheesy it tasted better than it sounded on the menu.  I tried my friends loaded tots and they were just ok. However I would like to try the salchipapas on their menu next time! Salchipapas are french fries with hot dog bits on top and other miscellaneous toppings.

When we were done, someone from the back came and cleared our table, even though we could have done so ourselves. This is a great establishment, and I will definitely be back here in the future!"}

After the steam subsided I'd say it was the latter of my statements. 

Go figure I found Steamie Weenie TOTALLY at random, but what a find indeed and by no means does the 5 star even do this place justice! Overall this was just simply perfection from beginning to end! I mean c'mon now see my pictures of how they segregate the bathrooms even (a weenie for the males and buns for the ladies). How can you go wrong?!?

Location wise it is based out of a small, but blossoming strip mall in Henderson and actually was not really much of a drive from the strip as well so certainly something doable. We were coming from the Southern Highland area (near the M casino) and it took roughly about 15 minutes and the restaurant itself was not that difficult to spot, but with a name like Steamie Weenie even in Vegas that tends to stand out? Ha-ha.

From perusing the menu ahead of time it was one of those "has something for every member of the family" type of menus. It had the regular go-to's for the kids, and what certainly made this outing even possible a vegan based hot dog (as I had a member who passed until she heard about the vegan hot dog offering) so definitely even among how it looks on the outside it was quite healthy on the inside.

As for the food, I did find everything to be surprisingly light and I did not feel like I needed to be carted out on a gurney afterwards which is a testament to the attention to health here. I went for the loaded tots as a side and they were prepared to golden brown perfection with a light crisp to it, but absent was the oodles of grease I'm used to getting pretty much everywhere else. Not scrimped on here was the "loaded" portion of the tots. The sour cream was lightly drizzled on the top of mounds of melted cheese, scallions, and the crowd pleasing: bountiful chunks of BACON!  

Now for the main attraction set to knock your tooth out, the trailer park hot dog! There was a lot going on in this dog, but somehow it all comes together and works marvelously. It starts with the great tasting all beef foot long hot dog that had the much sought after snap with each bite (I appreciated that more than anything). From here it was engulfed in piles of crispy fried onion strings, to die for coleslaw that would make the south rise up again, and literal chunks of spam (I think I had the equivalent of maybe two thick slices of it actually). What sets it apart though was for one the beer cheese (and yes there's a difference) and the watermelon BBQ sauce. It had me wanting to shout OH YEEEEEAH like the kool-aid man during each bite!

All in all this place is amazing. We did strike up a conversation with the owners as we walked out and I'm very impressed at how humble they were, but also just the care that they put into what they do. We were treated like family and I really begged them to open up a restaurant in California so I didn't dream of this in between Vegas trips. So definitely when you want a well prepared hot dog don't waste time on the strip and channel your inner dog. Think steamie and even think weenie and trek on over here as you will NOT be disappointed!"}

It was fabulous and worth the 25 minute drive. I'll be back. The reindeer dog had a more subtle reindeer/caribou flavor but I enjoyed it. I think most people would like it whether they like game flavor or not. I want to try the whole menu now. The kids corn dog is massive which was cool because I got to eat what my son couldn't finish.

Chili Mac Dog: hot dog topped with chili and mac & cheese.  2/5

Baked potato tots: basic nothing special. The beer cheese didn't add any real benefits as far as flavor. If anything melted cheddar would have been a better approach. 2/5"}

My husband loved his Mt. Fuji dog and the Pushcart. He is already making his selections for the next visit. We also got the loaded tots which was amaze balls. I tried the steamie sauce on the side as well.

We've been here twice now. Our food was DELICIOUS. Somehow its never the same the second time, but still good. I ordered the jalapeno popper and my gf the Coney Island. Both were prepared quickly and presentation was amazing. They looked picture perfect. This was no McDonalds bait and switch. The Jalapeno Popper tasted exactly like a jalapeno popper and was amazing! My gf said the Coney Island was good. I can usually tell if she likes a menu item by the look on her face, what she says after her first bite, and if she finishes it. The Coney Island looked like a winner. The second time we ordered, the presentation was a a bit messy and the temperature was luke warm. We DID order ahead (maybe this is a factor). But for some reason, crushed expectations changes the flavor :(   Nevertheless we still love this place. 

This is one of the best places to satisfy your gourmet hot dog craving.

I use to hate hog dogs. I remember having to eat those plastic wrapped poisonous wieners from the regular grocery stores when I was younger. There are healthier options now and supposedly not full of whatever they use to stuff in these things...at least I will believe this is true."}

Steamie Weenie is the latest arrival to the culinary category of creatively topped dogs.
There are so many cool dogs to try, some of the classics like the Windy City Chicago dog, the chili- and mustard-topped Coney, and the Carolina Slaw Dog.

Among the goofiest are: The Georgia Scramble, adds a pile of oyster crackers to mustard, ketchup, chili, onions and pickles.
The 9th Island is mountain of fried Spam cubes atop a tangy grilled pineapple relish. 

I've tried a few, my favorite one is Jalapenos Popper Dog. Its loaded Beer and Cream cheese with Jalapenos. (Yum!) See when food tastes good, my rationale tends to fail on me. I thought it would be fun to mix the Yucatan and the Sriracha sauce together for extra kick. Needless to say I caused myself unnecessary pain for being stupid. I still managed to finish it though.

I'm used to mixing my mac&cheese with hot dog meat, so I had to pick the next logical choice the M&C&C, this dog tastes awesome!! It can get really messy if your able to eat it with your hands, I'd suggest eating it with utensils.

The staff are nice people especially Bob (the owner). He cares about the product he puts out and he just wants people to enjoy his food..

Highly recommend!!"}

The owner asked if I have been there before and I said it's my first time. He handed me their updated menu so I didn't get mixed up with the menu on the wall. So nice! I ordered the Coney Island Hot Dog (premium Vienna Beef frankfurter, special hot dog chili, diced onions, and yellow mustard) Das Wurst (German-style bratwurst with spicy house mustard and sauerkraut), and Loaded Baked Potato Tots. I thought everything was really tasty, great quality, and the winning touch for me was that buns were steamed!!! It may not be a big deal for some, but to me it elevates the hot dog to something special. Nothing beats warm soft bread with a good hot dog. I would definitely come back to try their other hot dogs and goodies . Also, kudos to their excellent service."}

The employees were very friendly and seemed that they really wanted you there and even did table touches to see if every one was enjoying their food. The atmosphere was great. It was clean and appeared to be new? Very nice.

The bad. Way, way, way over priced!!!. This meal cost 15.48. Being from Chicago no hotdog stand would stay in business charging so much. For a couple of dogs, fries and water should be 6 or 7 dollars at the most. No fountain drinks either. Only fancy high sugar bottles in a cooler to pick from. I chose water because their was no diet selections and was charged 1.25 for a 16oz bottle. The next customer asked for a glass of water and the just gave the water to him without charge. Seemed odd to give to one and charge another?

I won't be back because of the price. 16 for 2 dogs is not what I'm willing to spend on a lunch. But good luck to the owner because the details are good and you can see his heart is in the joint."}

I live right down the street from this establishment and finally decided to give it a try.  I must say that I was not at all disappointed.

For starters, the owners are extremely friendly and welcoming.  Great people with great attitudes are the basis for a great experience.  They knocked it out of the park for me.

The decor is simple and colorful as one would hope/expect out of a hot dog spot.  Seating for about 20-30.  Standard fare aside from the custom painted wall which was a nice touch.

The menu!  I stood there chatting it up because I just couldn't decide what to choose.  All of the options were so creative.  I know I will be back to try several items but, this day, I decided to go with the following...

1 "Trailer Park"
1 side of Mac n Cheese
1 IBC bottled root beer

Total came out to 11.31.  Not the cheapest of meals but this wasn't your ordinary dog and side.  While not any one of the ingredients were outstanding, the combination was very satisfying.  It reminded me of my days as a child while integrating tastes I had acquired as an adult.  Very cool experience.  The mac n cheese was much better than I expected.  Had I not ordered it, I would have been all over a beer cheese option.

All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new and unique when it comes to the classic hot dog.

As a note, the only reason I am not giving a full 5 star rating today is for a couple of reasons.

1) Fountain drinks should be an option for those that want to save a little money.  The bottled selection they offer is great but having options would be nice.

2) The standard franks, while lengthy, aren't very robust.  I picked my dog based on the fact that there was an added protein topper.  Will be trying the hot link or bacon wrapped upgrade next time.

Congrats on the opening!"}

 My son had the mac and cheese dog, he loved it. He also tried the state fair dog (corn dog) and it was so so. Wasn't bad, just wasn't as impressive as the other dogs. Husband had the PBB & JJ, bacon wrapped dog with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly, he loved it. He also got the Carolina, has slaw, watermelon rind bbq sauce and pulled pork, he didn't finish it, he didn't care for it. I think it was a bit bland. I ordered the Maxwell, I chose the hot link, comes with grilled onions, mustard, beer cheese and peppers, so good!! We also had loaded tots and floats. I recommend getting a float, you pick any of the many glass bottles sodas to pair with.

We ordered the Trailer Park dog and the PBB&JJ dog, with sides of onion rings and fries, and two drinks.  Paid almost $20.  The flavor was good, the PBB&JJ was surprisingly delicious and extremely unique.  All served on locally baked hotdog buns, which were fresh and tasty!  The dogs themselves were flavorful and all beef.  We will go back to try more of their creations.

I do have some criticisms that prevent me from giving 5 stars.  (Actually, I'd give this a 3.5 rating because of these criticisms, but I rounded up because I like the dogs.)  For one, I think it is a mistake to upcharge for different styles of hotdog meat.  The menu items themselves are priced high enough that you should have the option to have a local link or an all beef dog or a brat for the same price.  I would love to try the local links but I'm not willing to turn my $7 hotdog into $8.  They only sell bottled beverages, and they add a hefty price to your total bill.  The basic sides, while inexpensive, are not good quality.  The onion rings were obviously frozen battered and the fries were also obviously frozen first."}

The only drinks available are bottled.  There are only two regular tables and the rest are high-tops. The menu is painted on the wall.  They have one high chair for the kiddies.  

I got a plain hot dog, chili-cheese fries, and a bottled root beer for $13.05.  Pretty expensive but it might be worth it if you got one of the more exotic hot dogs. That's the only reason to ever return here, really.  

Peeves: 
1) The majority of my fries were completely raw in the middle.  I'm talkin' crunchy raw potato, folks.  It wasn't pretty.  
2) Cockroach in the corner.  Not a big deal, it can happen to the best of us.  Doesn't mean it's a dirty place.  But sweep it up for crissakes.  
3) The ketchup on the table was empty but the mustard was brand new.  They could have taken two seconds to take the safety seal off the mustard before putting it on the table, but not a big deal, either.  

If I ever go back it will be for one of the strange hot dogs.  The staff were very friendly and chatty, and the hot dog was very good."}

The thanksgiving dog, who woulda thought it could be so good?

Steamie Weenie is a no frills just good old-fashioned hot dogs with all the tasty fixings! It's like a bun filled to the top with pure Americana!

Must orders, The Tucson and the Nor'Wester. The Tucson is a bacon-wrapped dog with pinto beans, tomato, diced onions, tomatillo lime salsa, yellow mustard, and mayonnaise. Yeah, it was mess and it was delicious. The layers of flavor were fantastic, the perfect mix of spicy, salty, citric amazingness.  

You like a da spicy? You're going to love da Nor'Wester! This... cream cheese, griddled onions, scallions, fresh jalapeño peppers, and Sriracha. It's has a kick trust me, I was sweating while enjoying this bad boy. 

Tater Tot lover? Order the fully loaded tots and you'll be a happy camper. Tots, bacon, and cheese, you're welcome. 

My only beef SW are the buns. I'd like a sturdier bun, they tend to fall apart when you're only halfway done eating your weenie. Also, how about buns that match the dog? Order a Nor'Westrer, get it on a jalapeno and cheese bun or an "everything" bun for the Everything Bagel Dog? 

Just a weenie thought for great weenie spot."}

I ordered the salchipappas $5 and it was steamy hot which was perfect for my craving. It's crinkle fries with hot dog pieces and steamie sauce. Yum yum!!
My husband got the baked potato tots $4.75 all I have to say about this is beer and cheddar cheese on top of tots! The little bit he let ke have was delicious. He also got the coney weenie $5.75. Not half bad. He enjoyed it but I'm just not a fan of chili on hot dogs. 
Overall, great experience and I will be back for happy hour for the floats"}

I really like trying new hot dog flavors and The Steamie Weenie does a really good job on putting together different flavor combos together. Be on the lookout for their Specials because it's usually a limited time flavor like for St.Party's Day they had a corned beef hot dog with sauerkraut which was pretty good. The hot dog bun is nicely steamed too and that makes the hot dog experience complete. They also offer craft sodas if you want something cold and bubbly to go with your meal. The sides are all comfort goodness. I really like the loaded tater tots. It comes with bacon pieces, sour cream, and sliced green onions.  

Service is always professional and down to earth. It's a mom and pop shop and they make the effort to make you feel welcomed and are grateful for your business. They take the time and care to put the food together from prepping to presentation. Even on the to go orders! The food is never hastily thrown in a box or smashed together no matter how busy they get. As simple as a hot dog may seem, the fact that the workers care about how you get the food when you get home says a lot about the pride they take on their food and service.

Okay, all jokes aside, my bf and I wanted to eat something to hold us over until dinner and didn't want to be too full so we ordered the Windy City with a vegan frankfurter and a side of tots which we shared. They were nice enough to offer cutting the weenie in half for us. Toppings were yummy and I was no longer hangry. We also picked up a unique Pumpkin flavored soda from their collection of sodas which was delicious! 

Their menu does offer different variations of the hotdog, all of which sound amazing. I'd come back again for another quickie to try a  build your own with some different toppings. 

They're very friendly. They asked how the meal was a few bites in  and if everything was okay. Even wished us a good day our way out."}

We were pleasantly surprised that they offered vegan dogs ($0.99 extra), but even more surprised by how yummy their hotdogs were!  And not too heavy on the stomach, either.

Perhaps a spicy red salsa would be much better. It had plenty of beans. 

The loaded potato tots were better than the dog, for me, and they were a pile of greasy goodness! The tots have lots of bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream and all the flavor! I hope the other 3 kinds of tots on the menu are this good! You can make a meal out of this dish for sure."}

First of all, the parking lot sucks. The Pebble Marketplace is absolutely the worst. It's like the parking lots in Chinatown.. but busier. But get past the parking situation and you'll find yourself in a small little hot dog spot where the owners are a sweet husband and wife team. They have delicious combinations of unique toppings for hot dogs, and they all have cute creative names. Service is exceptional, and how could you not want to try a place called Steamie Weenie? Go for it, you won't be disappointed! (And whatever you get, make sure it has the beer cheese on it. DELISH.)"}

This is not the normal hot dogs u get at the grocery store for 3.99....these are real genuine quality hot dogs!

And if you've never had a quality hot dog before the Steamie Weenie....you have been missing out!!  There are quality hot dogs out there and please don't expect to pay what u pay for hot dogs at the grocery store.

You pay for what u get. :) and for me...Steamie Weenie was absolutely worth every penny. I can't wait to go back!! :)

Now enough of my vent....:)

I went with my bf and we ended up getting 3 hot dogs and an order of tater tots with chili and cheese.  Let me tell u...the tots were for real. Crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside like any good tater tot should be. :)

My bf had the Coney Style....And he absolutely loved it!!!

I was the little porker and had the Mt. Fuji and the bratwurst special. :)

Let me begin the review for the hot dogs and say....WOW....the buns were freaking amazing!!! :)  They were soft and almost just melted in your mouth. :)

The Mt. Fuji came with teriyaki onions, green onions, carrots and wasabi mayo....let's just say it was bomb. The carrots gave it that nice crunch and the onions a nice little bit of sweetness and the vienna hot dog had the best snap and alot of flavor without all that saltiness that I get with regular hot dogs. And of course I can't forget the nori....:) it added just a little without overpowering the entire dish for that umami flavor. :)

And what can I say about the bratwurst....it was delicious. Had just the right amount of mustard and sauerkraut for that perfect bite. :)

And if u love spicy food like I love spicy food....get their Habanero sauce. Omg....it added so much flavor and a nice but of heat.....soooooo good!!!

And if u ask nicely....they'll even sell u a bottle....:)

I can't wait to go back and try their other hot dogs...yum yum yum....:)"}

Staff are great and explained the different types of hotdogs they got to offer... 

Parking is limited as there are other places to eat in the area.. 

Something about their hotdog buns that makes the meal truly amazing! The hotdog was very tasty and the awesome toppings they offer works very well!! 

Windy City and Tucson are my top picks!! 

Will be back for sure to try the others..

I went to the Restaurant on FRIDAY MARCH 3, 2017 to pick up an order. I walked in the Restaurant to ask for an order I was picking up and the gentleman at the counter (NO NAME TAG) was very vulgarer with me and used some foul language at me. I tried to explain to him about my order and he proceeded to keep interrupting me. 

I recently placed my own order to just try the food here to have a better FOOD review as well. The hot dogs are just like any other ones you would get elsewhere, but just really was not what I expected. I have a regular place I usually go to but thought I would try this place, not somewhere I would return to or order from again.

1. Food not the best for the quality I look for
2. The presentation is horrible
3. Customer Service is not the best"}

I never would have guessed it would be for hot dogs, but Steamie Weenie is definately worthy enough! 

Once again, thanks to Yelp, I found this new business just off the 215 and Green Valley Parkway in the Pebble marketplace. Steamie weenie is a locally owned business which I always try and support. It is decorated simple yet fun with dark wood floors and "Steamie weenie" spray painted on the wall. They offer not only gourmet hot dogs with interesting combinations of flavors but several sides as well as the coolest bottled soda collection I have seen. 

We were welcomed immediately as we walked in. They were happy to offer suggestions as it was our fist time. I went with the Carolina slaw dog and a side of tots. The Carolina dog has coleslaw, pulled pork, diced onions and their famous watermelon rind bbq sauce which is excellent. Everything went together really well. My only minor complaint was that I thought the actual hot dog got a little lost as it was on the smaller side. The tots were good but could have been crispier. 

I will definately be returning to try several other things on the menu such as the trailer park dog, onion rings, the mac n cheese and that pumpkin pie soda I saw. If your in the mood for a dog this is the place to go."}

I rank it as one of the worst parking lots in the valley.  I have always dreaded pulling into it's maze of parking barriers, funky travel lanes occupied by crabby angry people wanting to play bumper cars with you.  We were in Hendo recently and in need of sustenance.  Despite the heinous parking lot, PM is filled with little gems.  I rolled into the parking lot and assumed the form of water traveling all the paths of least resistance until I found a spot on the north end.

Still not sure where to dine, we spied Steamie Weenie.  I had seen it was trending on yelp and with that developed a hankering for a hot dog.  I pitched the idea to the GF and did some quick research on yelp to see if they had a turkey dog or something similar to sweeten the proposition.  She agreed to visit with the promise of a vegan frankfurter.  

We entered and were greeted by Bob, the owner.  He happily explained the menu.  I spotted the Nor'Wester.  It consisted of cream cheese, grilled onions, jalapeños, scallions and siracha.  I asked if I could swap the regular dog for one wrapped in bacon.  Not a problem.  The crunch of bacon with the cream cheese was an awesome combination.  The bun was moist and very soft.

The GF got a Mac & Cheese dog with a vegan frank.  The Boy got something off the menu that was spicy with some fries on the side.  

There is no soda machine.  You do however, have your choice of an assortment of bottled traditional and novelty sodas.

When I am on this side of the valley again, I would absolutely look Steamie Weenie up again!"}

My husband has been raving about this spot for awhile now, but hotdogs are not my favorite so I didn't rush over. Imagine my surprise when I started reading articles about how great this place is and it started to sound like something special.

The restaurant is decorated very cute for a hot dog place. The weenie on the wall is adorable. Most of the tables are high top tables, but some of the chairs have backs. A place to hang my purse! This excites me more than it should because normally I hate tall tables. 

Both of the people working were really friendly. I could tell they want to be successful and appreciate their customers. 

I had the Windy City dog. The hotdog was larger than the standard hot dog and delicious. The toppings were plentiful and tasty. The ingredients seemed fresh and better than what I expected from a hot dog place. For example, the diced tomatoes were definitely fresh and not from a can. 

My husband had the Tucson and Georgia Scramble. I tasted these and loved them. As with my dog the toppings were plentiful and fresh. The Tucson starts with a bacon wrapped dog so you can't go wrong with that.

We split the Tot Chos which was like a frito pie (sub tots for fritos). So good! Hopefully I'm not giving them too much credit, but the chili seemed homemade or they chose good chili because I loved it. It wasn't like the canned chili my husband sneaks into the house. 

I'm already getting hungry for my next visit from writing this. I can't wait to come back."}

The PBB&JJ is a bacon wrapped hot dog, peanut butter, and jalapeno jelly. Great combination of sweet and savory. Probably the tastiest and most creative hot dog I've ever had.

For a side, I had the Tot-Chos, which are tater tots with shredded cheddar cheese, chili, sour cream, jalapenos, and tomatoes. Like nachos, but replace the chips with tater tots. More of a traditional and familiar side order flavor profile. Also delicious.

This doesn't get five stars because of price. The PBB&JJ was $6.29 and the Tot-Chos were $4.59. For about $12 after tax, it was definitely a delicious meal, but I was still hungry. I'm not expecting it to compete with Costco on hot dog pricing, but I would've had to order another hot dog to be satisfied, theoretically pushing the meal to the $20 range. It doesn't feel right to be at that price point for hot dogs."}

We had tried their PB and Jelly Dog at a Yelp event, it was very interesting and wanted to try more. We were in the area after a hike so we gave them a try. 
 These were OK, just nothing special, have had better. We got a Chili Cheese , the Tuscon, and the Trailer Park.  We also got a side of Tator Tots to share which I really liked, they made them nice and crispy, not greasy. Used some fry sauce for dipping, I'd go back for Tots. They have a selection of odd flavored sodas which is fun, had a vanilla root beer. 
Staff was friendly and got our food order fast and correct. The place was clean. Prices are on par with other fancy hot dog places."}

I remembered I had heard about this place & we decided to give it a try.  My husband ordered a rather boring Maxwell Street hot link, which he said was really good.  I wanted to be a little more adventurous, so I got a bacon wrapped jalapeño popper dog.  It was really tasty!  I loved the flavor of the beer cheese on it.  We also split a mac & cheese & cheese dog which was yummy as well, next time I might add grilled onions to it, though.  Shared an ordered of pickle fries, too -- the best I've ever had, I was confused at first 'cuz I'd only ever had sliced fried pickles & these looked like fries.  The ranch we had to dip them in was perfect.
This place isn't close to our house, but we'll be heading back there soon 'cuz there are several other weenies I want to try.
Oh, the only thing I didn't like was the lack of fountain drinks.  My root beer was really good, but overpriced.  I was still thirsty, but didn't want to pay another $2.50 for a second drink.  That made it a 4 star review for me."}

My first visit was to do a little hot dog recon (military vet here!), purchasing four different hot dogs to take back to a gathering for...taste examination:
BLT dog, Carolina Slaw dog, Mac n' Cheese dog, and Windy City dog. The outcome:
Mac n' Cheese got thumbs up!
BLT got thumbs up!
Carolina Slaw got thumbs up!
Windy City...got thumbs tentatively up (the neon green relish combined with the peppers,
     not so much, but the overall taste, good). If you are not a fan of the peppers, just leave 
     those off!

Yes, all their drinks are bottled, so if having the fountain type drink is your thing, you can STILL have a GREAT hot dog, tots (even specialty tots!), root beer float.  If you would prefer, you can bring your fountain soda in with you. Seriously, even checked with the owner and he was cool with that. Now, they have over 24 types of bottled sodas (including the line of Fanta's!!!!), bottled lemonade, tea, and bottled water. If you have children who may not be able to handle a glass bottle, they have cups behind the counter.

I'm not sure where the idea of the menu being painted on the wall was seen. When you walk in the door, if you turn to your left there is a large, framed area where the menu has been printed by category. If you want to see an individual one, they are right there to the left of the register. When they are really busy (I was there this past Saturday and wow....lots of people!!!!), you may want to just ask for a menu so you can be looking over your choices while you are waiting to order. That might be something to consider...having an employee zip around out there when they are really really busy and thank folks for coming, hand them a menu so they can connect before they get to the register. 

Today was my third Carolina Slaw dog in.....I really shouldn't admit to this....about 10 days. I know, I know.....I'm going to turn into a hot dog! But hey, what a way to go!!!!

In terms of price, you will pay essentially what you pay when you go through that fast food drive thru. Seriously...by the time you order one of those numbered selections and respond "yes" to making it a large and add tax, it is about the same give or take a dollar or two. The hot dogs and toppings are a great size/helping and I can't imagine going away hungry....unless you were nice enough to share yours with someone so you didn't get the whole thing!!!!

Today was yes, the Carolina Slaw dog, a root beer float (I chose O-So Butterscotch Root Beer for mine), a side of tots, and a bottled soda. The atmosphere is indigenous to the type of business it is. Picture yourself at a hot dog stand on a busy street in New York City. You walk up to the vendor, order your dog, and you stand there eating it....you might see folks juggling a soda or maybe they found a bench nearby and sat down. It's exactly what I would expect...stand around a high table and enjoy....sit on one of the stools available at the tables. There are two regular height tables with chairs as well. The restaurant is ADA compliant in terms of access for wheelchairs, motorized chairs, etc. If you were to come in and need one of the two regular tables and they were taken, I can't begin to imagine that someone wouldn't move to make it available for you. :-)

Long review, but getting into this marketplace with all the other food establishments must be a challenge. I say....if you haven't tried one, c'mon......give it a try!!!!! YUM!"}

We tried Buldogis before so we figure the name here caught our attention and boy was this place a hidden gem pretty much. The flavors on the dogs we got mixed so well and nothing overpowered the other. I would even go ahead and say this place is better than buldogis just simply because the preparation and portion size is on point.

I got the Carolina which has pulled pork, slaw and an in house made watermelon bbq sauce. This one was not over sauced like some places that smother the pulled pork in sauce, the slaw was very good and not watery at all, plus they used a Nathan's all beef dog and a soft bun to compliment the ingredients.

My wife ended up getting the BLT and damn that was good too. There was just the right amount of toppings in this with a nice bacon wrapped Nathan's dog fried nicely. The last thing we got for ourselves was the loaded baked tots, it wasn't overly cheesy or heavy after eating any of this. We could do our hike afterward without the bloated feeling like some hot dog spots give you."}

I actually had Steamie Weenie bookmarked and heard about this place from someone before.

I stuck with the classic Cheese Chili Cheese dog with added diced onions and jalapeños. It was good, nothing extraordinary. Tasted like a chili cheese dog.

After trying my boyfriend's hotdog, that he custom made, I wished I had done that too. So he got the Vienna dog wrapped in bacon with spicy mustard, mayo, diced onions, scallions, jalapeños, and sauerkraut. It was a beauty and the flavors exploded in my mouth. It was so good that I think they should make this a staple on their menu.

Overall, I will probably be back. But it's not cheap. The two hotdogs with one side of tater tots and 2 drinks set us back $20."}

I would have liked to get a cup of water and keep refilling it because I was thirst and can't afford to pay $3-4 every time I want to buy another drink. Also, I HIGHLY suggest a glass recycling bin for all those soda bottles. I came with friends and we went through 9 glass bottles of sodas in our one visit and they all went in the regular trash. All those glass bottles not being recycled everyday? Just my two cents :) give this place a try! SO many non-plain Jane options. You won't be disappointed :)"}

  The Carolina  (pulled pork & coleslaw topped dog) was tasty, too. There are several ways to top fries or tots and a wide variety of bottled sodas are on hand. Stop in & say "hi" to Bob & he'll help you pick your favorite."}

I decided to create my own dog which had: cream cheese, grilled pineapple relish, jalapeño jelly and fried onions. The sweet woman working there who I think is also the owner recommended I throw a little sirracha on top and... hot diggity dog!!!! It was the most amazing hot dog I have ever had. The dog itself was cooked to perfection. I wish I would have ordered two to be honest lol. I really loved the unique options they had to offer, and I am so happy I found this place because otherwise I would have never known you can do so much more with a hotdog than ketchup and relish!!

Peanut butter and jalapeño jelly... Genius! 
My wife had a chilly cheese hot dog very good!! And the loaded tots are great and plenty for two to share.

I've checked it out twice now. First time I ordered a chili cheese dog and second time I ordered the bratwurst with tater tots. Overall, a great addition to my neighborhood, particularly because I love hot dogs and the owners of this local store really care. The only con is that it is pretty pricy. Each time, I spent $7-$8 on a specialty hot dog. It was enough for a meal, but more along the lines of what I'd expect to pay at a tourist site (although this is better quality).

To start, they care a lot about the food. When I tried the brats and the dogs, the owners talked about how many different suppliers and dogs they tried. They tried a bunch of sauerkrauts for the bratwurst too. And the bread is soft and fluffy, and the tater tots were fried up super crispy and fresh and salted just right. These little things show that they are paying attention to the food. Each dog is grilled after you order it, so it's much, much better than a boiled dog or a roller dog. The dogs had a nice casing and good snap with juicy insides. I will be back regularly when the mood for a dog strikes!"}

Follow them on social media to find out about their off-menu specials, such as the Run, Run, Rudolph dog for December: reindeer sausage topped with caramelized onions and sriracha cream. Simple but super tasty, it took a lot of effort to share this with my guy.

Solid menu standbys include the Everything Bagel dog (w/cream cheese and scallions) and the Japanese-inspired Mt. Fuji dog (teriyaki onions, nori, carrots, scallions, wasabi mayo). Don't even get me started on side options (tot-chos, anyone?!).

Location is cozy, service is genuinely friendly, and they even have a condiment bar to doctor up your dog with extra hot sauces and mustards. Don't forget about their house fry sauce and beer cheese!"}

They also let us sample the jalapeno jelly and the steamie sauce; both of which were very tasty. The jelly was still sweet but had that nice spicy kick for the jalapeño but it wasn't overpowering. The steamie sauce is a mix of mayo, their watermelon rind bbq sauce, and some other secret ingredients. 

My fiance got the jalapeño popper dog which had cream cheese, beer cheese and jalapeños slices on the top. It literally tasted like a jalapeño popper so the beer cheese was a nice addition. I got the trailer park dog which had spam, beer cheese, their watermelon rind bbq sauce, coleslaw and crispy onions (which I'm pretty sure is French's crispy fried onions). Super messy, but very tasty.

The real winner was their salchipapas fries. It had thin slices of a hotdog over the bed of crinkle fries along with a good portion of the steamie sauce drizzled on top. I think I'm addicted to the sauce because it complemented the fries so well.

Everything was made to order so everything was fresh,  crunchy and steamie. I will have to try the pbb&jj dog the next time I come back if I am ever in the area again."}

I usually don't eat dogs unless I've got a beer in hand and I'm at a baseball game or picnic, but I was given a gift card and it was loaded up enough to get lunch twice for a party of two. Some of the hot dogs were unique that I haven't seen before and the service was really friendly from this family owned dog-themed restaurant on both of my visits.

If you manage to find parking, you can order at the counter once you enter and enjoy your dog at one of the high tops. The menu consists of some "old dogs", some "new tricks" or you can just custom build your own. They have fries as a side, but I wouldn't miss out on the tots if you're a fan. The loaded potato tots are topped just like a loaded baked potato with some extra crunch added from the fried, shredded taters. If the tots aren't enough of an accompaniment, you can have one of their house made dipping sauces or grab a soda from the cooler and drink it straight from the bottle.

You also can use the Eat 24 app for delivery, or for pick up, which is what I did on my second trip. My order was ready at the requested pick up time and nothing was missed. Out of the four dogs I tried, the Nor'Wester was my favorite with plenty of kick from the sriracha and jalapenos, sweetness from the grilled onions, and some tart from the cream cheese. The More Cowbell was my least favorite solely because the pulled pork was dry.

Steamie Weenie does proclaim that they use Nathan's and Vienna Beef, but when I hear "hot dog," words like, "processed," "nitrates," and "mystery meat" pop in my head that give a negative connotation. I will still eat them occasionally and enjoy them. Although I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, I am a fan of this locally owned business and will continue to support them whenever I'm in the mood."}

What could I say? It's my thing!

Located close to Green Valley Ranch, this place serves gourmet hot dogs for very reasonable prices. My favorite is the PB&JJ hoy dog, which is a hot dog with peanut butter and jalapeño jelly to top it off. Let me tell you, don't knock it 'til you try it! Being a little daring and listening to the cashier's recommendations, I ordered it my first time visiting and it has been my ultimate favorite ever since.

As many have stated, follow their social media accounts to keep in track of their revolving speciality hot dogs. For instance, they have speciality hot dogs during Thanksgiving, Mardi Gras, etc. Sometimes, they even pair up with local charities and give some of the proceeds to them if you buy said hot dogs. Great hotdogs for a great cause, right?

Don't forget to try some of the sides they offer! Loaded Tot-chos and Doggy Style Tots? Yum! The names are as fun as the deliciousness of the items.

Service is as great as the food. Never once had a bad experience. Come and check this place out! There's nothing weenie about anything here!"}

I must say the Carolina slaw dog was my favorite! Pulled pork on a steamie weenie with slaw and watermelon rind bbq sauce. The flavors were bold and they popped! My jalapeño popper dog was just as good, everything is good when you add cream cheese and jalapeño though in my opinion. Their Chile cheese fries were also delicious and just the right amount too. Our order was under 20 which you can't beat considering its lunch for two. I am looking forward to coming back and trying their other dogs!"}

We ordered:

Windy City dog-their take on a Chicago Dog. I didn't try it because I personally don't like Chicago dogs but my boyfriend said it was really good. 

Cheese chili cheese dog-beer cheese, chili, and melted shredded cheese. Really good chili cheese dog. I shared with my boyfriend because it was big. 

Kids puppy dog-smaller hot dog served with crinkle fries. Perfect for kids. 

Kids Jr corn dog-fresh battered corn dog. Actually really large so lucky me since my son couldn't finish it and I got to snag a few bites. Crunchy batter that was really good. Also served with crinkle cut fries. 

Loaded baked potato tots-tater tots piled with cheese, bacon, sour cream, and green onions. So good that I'm already craving them as I write this review. 

We asked for a water and they gave us a bottled water which was really nice. 

We also got 3 ice cream floats for happy hour. Really cool to choose a vintage soda to pair with the two scoops of ice cream. 

The food was really good and filling. The service was amazing. I didn't catch the name of the cashier but he was so helpful and even on his way out of work he stopped to ask us how everything was. Great food and service will definitely have me back for more."}

My boyfriend got the Maxwell classic dog and he loved it, I tried a bite and it had one of the best brats we've ever had in it. The only thing that would improve that dog would be to chop up the grilled onions versus the long slices, but it wouldn't stop us from getting it again. I tried the 9th Island and it was oh so ono! The spam could have been cut into smaller pieces (for easier eating and less falling off to floor) but the pineapple relish was the best! I don't know who provides their local made hot dogs, but they were very good and big! We also loved that they had all glass bottle sodas of different varieties because I am always up for trying ones I've never had.

Be sure to get the steamie sauce which is their watermelon rind BBQ sauce/mayo fry sauce. It is the perfect consistency and tastes great! I would gladly drive across town to come back to this place!"}

The food was decent. I went with the chili-cheese dog. Think it was called the Cheese Chili Cheese. Nothing too notable about it though. The chili was decent, there really wasn't enough cheese on there, despite the extra cheese noted in the name. We did get a side of the beer cheese and honestly that would have been a homerun if there was more of that on there. 

I think the best part of Steamie Weenie is their ridiculously awesome variety of bottled sodas. I can't remember which Cream Soda I went with, but it was top notch. They even had Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer which I haven't seen in many years. Remember when you could get them for a quarter at Costco? Anyways, I think I'd be inspired to go back just for the pop. 

The service was excellent, especially for a fast/cas place. The kid who rung us up was super helpful and knew the menu through and through. Appreciated some of the suggestions he was giving on the soda front since that was a bit overwhelming.

This is a strong three star rating, but I'd like to see a little more out of the dogs next time."}

After a few minutes looking over the menu and arguing with myself, i got the following:

Savage
Jalapeno Popper
Loaded Tots

The Savage is just as the name implies.  It is SAVAGE!!  Oh my gosh was it delicious!!!!!!  I'm not sure of all the toppings, but I know it was a bacn wrapped hot dog topped with bleu cheese and grilled onions.  Easily one of the best hot dogs I've ever eaten.

The Jalapeno Popper was good.  I love spicy and this one hit the spot.  I especially liked that the jalapenos were fresh and not pickled.  The creme cheese adds a nice rich creaminess to the dog.

The Loaded Tots was my least favorite item.  I kind of thought the portion was a little small for the price.  Also, the toppings were a little light.  I'd rather have had a third hot dog over ordering these tots.

Overall a great place to grab a bite to eat.  Service was good.  Friendly staff and food came out fast.  I would definitely go back and feast again!!"}

The place had several customers eating and my order was taken at the counter immediately by a friendly person.  I asked if the $2.00 dogs applied to Coneys and he said he could "dress up" a couple of dogs for me.  I ordered 2 Coneys with mustard and onion.  The two dogs came to $6.60.  The buns were almost cold, the chili was luke warm, and tasted as if it was the cheap canned chili.  I was not impressed with the Coneys at all and was actually disappointed.  I thought at least the dogs would be steamed or "hot" and did not expect the canned chili.  The menu said the Coney's are normally $5.75.  I don't know how they will be able to stay in business selling a cold generic coney with canned chili.  Their other dogs looked appetizing but I did not try any, as I had to hurry home and see if I could get the mustard and chili stains out of my shirt."}

They let us know about the new hours they had (open earlier and later) as well as some new dogs they had coming. One of the dogs they mentioned was the Ring of Fire. It sounded like happiness in a bun, so I ordered one. It took about 10 minutes for my order to arrive, and it was worth the wait. The Ring of fire had a chipotle aioli, deep fried jalapeños, and goat peppers. It was flavored beautifully, like a perfect desert sunrise. It was refreshing without burning my taste buds. I also got the loaded tater tops. They were filling, I couldn't finish the basket.

Great Dogs with a plethora of toppings to choose from. I originate from Cali, so I love the bacon wrapped dog and add some grilled onions, mustard and ketchup. Reminds me of the street vendors outside of Staples Center after a Lakers game. Great sides, the baked loaded tots are a great choice and are more than enough to share as well are the onion rings. I also really like the old school bottled sodas they have instead of the fountain drinks. Nice touch to an already great hot dog experience.

What lured me into coming here was the variety of toppings and creative combinations that they have to put on top of your hot dog. 

MENU:

They have the favorite regional classics; including Windy City, Coney, Tucson, Carolina.

You can also customize your hot dog too! Choice of beef, bacon wrapped or Vegan one!  Also hot link that's made locally.

The dogs they serve here are Vienna Beef brand, but the owner told me the bacon wrapped ones are Nathan's.

The fun creations: 9th Island! with Pineapple relish and Spam of course! There's one with Mac and Cheese too. 

Also novelty items they sell are vintage sodas in glass bottles with retro labels.  Upside: made with pure cane sugar, downside: a little pricier for the amount you get. There's no fountain sodas, so you thirsty soda addicts, don't count on refills.

ORDER OF THE DAY :

I ended up getting the Trailer Park with Beer Cheese, Fried Onions, coleslaw, watermelon rind bbq sauce and SPAM!  Yes you read right, Spam! Hot dogs don't scream healthy eats, so sure more nitrates, why not! I live for cheat day/weekend. Anyways good stuff!  Especially the beer cheese and watermelon bbq sauce. The hot dog buns were soft and our weenies were steamy! 

Oh try the crinkle cut fries!  They made these perfect!  I mooched some fries off of Mr.  B's order.  Crunchy exterior and potatoey moist inside . It doesn't taste like those store bought ones which I hate.   I regret not getting my own now.

LOCATION - ATMOSPHERE

This joint is located in Pebble Marketplace, where Smith's is the anchor. Hightop tables and barstools make up most of the seating in dining area. Cool graffiti wall art for deco. 

PRICE: 

Average... if you look at it from the "it's a gourmet dog" perspective. I personally think 
$6.28 for my dog is a little out there, but don't mind paying, because the toppings they added on justified the cost. But among the hot dog places we dine at, we spent the most amount here. The owners said they will have daily specials and deals coming up so look forward to those.  

It's family owned and operated. Staff was really welcoming and helpful!

Bottom line, cool niche for foodies. This place fits right here in Green Valley!"}

Really nice that they care about their vegan customers like that! 

The dog was amazing, and I can't wait to try more combos (as well as onion rings!). The actual restaurant is so adorable - I was especially tickled by the plain bun on the door for the women's room, and the hot dog on the men's room door. My boyfriend also asked them for a cup of water and they handed him a full bottle of water. I was so taken aback that we had to tip extra.

I have to say our meal was a bit over priced for hot dogs but I get it!  We are paying to eat in a restaurant.  A meal deal would be nice, like a dog, fries/tots and a drink.  I would also figure out a way to at least offer free water, but understand that since there is no soda fountain, you probably can't.

Update: bottled water available upon request per the owner. Just a lack of knowledge on the cashier but it's all good! Meal deals are in the works as well if not already in place!"}

They have a nice selection of hot sauces to add to your dog if you want. My husband had the chili & cheese (which does have meat as they warned us). Chili was good and not too chunky. 
We split an order of tot-chos. Which had crispy tater tots covered in chili, sour cream, and cheese. The jalapeños and tomatoes on top were tasty and very fresh.
They have a decent selection of interesting sodas. Lots of root beer and cane sugar based drinks. Husband had the old school Dr Pepper. I even think I saw a celery soda. I wanted water, but they didn't have cups so they gave me a bottle of water for free. Nice touch."}

Why go out when you can have pretty much everything delivered to you? Including yummy hot dogs from Steamie Weenie.

The to-go packaging was perfect. My dog arrived just exactly how the pictures look. Pretty impressive for to-go / delivery. They also wrap it in foil and then put it in the to-go container. No leakage here.

It was difficult to choose just one dog. I was quite tempted to order 2 or 3. And I have a sneaking suspicion that I would've found a different choice more impressive.

So let's talk about my dog. I ordered the jalapeno popper one as it sounded spicy and unique - cream cheese, beer cheese sauce, and jalapenos. The dog was perfectly cooked. The bun was soft and yummy all on it's own (a rarity when it comes to hot dog buns). And I was impressed that the toppings were just right. It wasn't overwhelming and sloppy where you just taste toppings and not the dog. But they also weren't skimpy on the toppings either. It was definitely very tasty. But I was hoping for some more spiciness. But still, tasty.

I also ordered some crinkle cut fries topped with their beer cheese sauce. Again, perfect amount of cheese. Not so much that the fries got soggy. But not so little that there were naked fries. And the fries were perfectly done.

So while I haven't actually been inside this establishment yet, consider me a fan. And if you're someone who can appreciate finding that perfect middle when it comes to toppings (just the right amount), you'll definitely appreciate this place."}

Went a bit overboard because one GIANT Ohio state fair corn dog or a couple chili cheese dogs would fill me up but I didnt know that so I ordered one of each and some totchos which are nacho tater tots.

Way too much for my fat...um...   

The food was delicious, service was excellent and it was clean and a bonus was finding sprechers soda which is very hard to find in Vegas, Zia has cherry but not Grape as this place does!

My only negative would be that it was pricey, $45 for the 2 of us but then again we went overboard...still I wish they had combos, like a chili dog with fries and a soda?    

We will return though but probably not for a while, Its time for Christmas shopping for the next 2 months.    :)"}

The guy who took my order was friendly and the inside and tables were clean. 

Coney ($5.75) - Vienna beef frankfurter with their "special" hot dog chili, diced onions and yellow mustard. The hot dogs here are the kind that hang off either side of the bun. I'm not a huge fan of those, I personally like some bun with each bite.  Good amount of mustard and the chili did taste good. They have a lot of different hot dog options here.

Tot-Chos ($5.25) - Tots topped with beer cheese, chili, shredded cheddar cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos and sour cream. This was a good sized portion and worth every penny. The tots were perfectly crisp and everything tasted so good together. I'd come back just for these. My hubby had some and really like them too, even the fresh sliced halved tomatoes they added which he'd normally turn away from. 

There's a Teeny Weenie Kids Menu that's reasonably priced. No fountain drinks here it's a cold soda case with a variety of bottled drinks priced at $2.25 each. I'm not sure if it's still going on, but they did have in September a promotion called "Weenie Wednesday" where they sold hot dogs for $2 each and sometimes they have a special themed hot dog for the month."}

If you can imagine a style of hot dog, these guys probably have it on the menu. We're talking Coney Islands, Chicago-style, Sonoran-style, and all done any which way you want with a good list of add-ons. They also have some interesting unique choices on the menu, with the mac & cheese & cheese dog being one of my favorites. 

Ask for the sides: the loaded tots are amazing, as are the salchipapas. Great place, and great price."}

I have lived here since 2006 and I have been going here from the very beginning. They have all you can eat like every other place (they say they will charge you if you don't finish, but I have never had this happen).

This is not a place to go if you are not into a laid back environment as it is more of a family/friends place. The servers are great and leave you to your meal but the space is so small it is extremely easy to flag them down when you need something. 

My only complaint and I always tell the manager is that they used to make their cucumber salad with shredded cucumbers but they have since changed to chopping them. It just doesn't taste the same, everything else however I love. I will continue to go here until I move from NV or they close their doors."}

Yes, I eat a lot of sushi. Yes, the sushi here is good. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat for $21.95... For that, you would think there would be more stars, BUT READ THE FINE PRINT... 

YOU GET CHARGED FOR WHAT YOU DON'T EAT, INCLUDING THE EXTRA BITS OF RICE LEFT BEHIND.

I can understand that if you order like 8 rolls and leave several pieces from each, it's a waste, but that was NOT the case for us. Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of $ from us. What we didn't appreciate is that EVERY TIME the guy came to our table he would warn us that we HAD to finish EVERYTHING. "We charge extra for leftovers," or, "We charge extra for uneaten rice," or, "I told you we charge extra, right?" 

The worst part was, if he wasn't at our table warning us, he never stopped staring at us. He would stand at his podium and WATCH us eat. Then he'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in Japanese. Specifically, he kept his eyes on me and it made me lose my appetite. He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me. 

I'm a laid-back person and I'm generous with my reviews, but this was, by far, my WORST sushi experience. I will not be back."}

Are you kidding me? This ain't my first rodeo with AYCE sushi. Anyway, when we ended up being the only table left, the sushi chefs were talking smack about us in Japanese. I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected. Going back to Yama off Flamingo/Maryland and for good reason - It's worth the drive, price, service, and overall experience.

We decided to try this place because we felt the need to spice up our Sushi schedule. We have three places that we alternate between and it was just time to switch things up!

I am going to warn you that when you pull in here and walk up your first instinct is going to be to turn right back around and walk back to your car. Ignore this feeling, I promise you the looks are decieving. It is a very, very tiny space probably has five tables and the bar, but I am telling you the rolls are amazing and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming!

We opted for AYCE, obviously. 

Our rolls we tried:

Screaming Orgasm
Nevada
Dragon
American
Baked Salmon
Baked Wet Dream
Tako (Octopus) Nigiri
Dynamite

We also had Garlic Edamame, Seaweed Salad, and of course Tempura Ice Cream for dessert!

Granted sushi was good but always felt like being rushed to get us out especially this last time we've gone. Must I say that we got the lunch AYCE for $19.95 and we still had about 15min. Of our limit AYCE time and the chef/owner had asked us if we wanted dessert already not if we would liked to order something else. Now, since this happened to me couple times I feel all weird out about this place and I will see other options of eating else where, where we are not being rushed to leave...."}

Rolls are good but you can do some half order and some not. Nigiris, oh no. TOO MUCH RICE!  and the fish is thinly sliced. Ugh.

Appetizers are good size. Ice cream? Why does it come in a plastic cup? Like as if it was pre-packaged.

I tried it for the first time the other day and it was pretty good. AYCE for about $23.95.

So far my favorite roll is the Sweetheart, shrimp tempura, crab meat and special sauce. When my friend ordered it I wasn't expecting it to be anything special, but I was definitely surprised. It's really good.

We didn't really get our money's worth on this trip as we only ordered about 2 rolls each, but I definitely plan on going back with a bigger appetite next time."}

We were talking about AYCE sushi places in Vegas, and he swears by Sushi Bay. I was curious because the last few places that I had tried hadn't blown me away in any sort of way. Even though I had passed by this restaurant probably a million times, for some reason, I have never gone in. Now, my thoughts have changed, and I am a Sushi Bay believer.

I've tried a little bit of everything on the menu. Rather than talk about each individual thing, I'll just give you the gist. There have only been two places that I have been too where all the fish and seafood from start to finish has been completely fresh. Number 1 is Goyemon. Number 2 is Sushi Bay. All the nigiri was very fresh across the board, no weird off flavors or textures. The rice was very good as well, just the right texture and temperature. I liked all the apps as well, they were simple but well prepared. If you do go there, I would also recommend trying out the Cherry Blossom, a marvel of avocado, crab, and goodness. They also have yaki-udon, which I haven't seen on a lot of AYCE sushi menus, and it tasted good. The only minor complaint was I thought the salmon skin was a bit too chewy for my taste, but nothing to take a star off or anything. The server was nice and attentive, and the sushi chef was friendly.

This place was very suprising. I've recently heard that Goyemon has changed a lot since my last visit, with a major turnover in staff, so this will probably be my go-to AYCE sushi spot in Vegas. Everything across the board was very good. From top to bottom, I can't find any major complaints about this place."}

Atmosphere was cute, decorated with traditional Japanese decor like in Japan, felt comfy. Waitress was really nice and friendly and took our order right away, never asked
For anything, all refills kept on coming along with napkins. Hubby and I got the all you can eat which was $23 dinner, and for lunch I believe it's $19, by far the cheapest sushi bar I've been to! 

All you can eat menu had a large variety of different kind of sushi, including specialty sushi, baked sushi and deep fried. My absolute favorite was the "Sushi Bay" roll. It's a must to try that. Also the "Super White Tuna" so fresh and creamy. 

I will most definitely come back for more. Give this place a try, I guarantee you'll leave happy and satisfied and possibly full."}

Flow of dishes was good. Seemed that chef went heavy on the rice for Nigiri; which is not a deal breaker for AYCE. However, I noticed something really odd with the Fried Scallop. The scallops tasted off and looked like imitation crap meat. When i sent it back, staff confirmed that it was indeed deep fried imitation crab. That is very sheisty to mislead the customers and serve fake food. Makes me question about where else are they cutting corners? Hence 1 start rating."}

My meal was very high and consistent quality. Especially impressive were the little things. Rice, so often overlooked, was high quality and done to perfection. The miso soup was homemade, fresh and light. One of the best I've had in years. 
Service was very polite, attentive and fast.

I decided to go with AYCE, and was given a sheet to place my order.  The chefs were really tentative and had good timing for getting the orders out.  Everything tasted amazing!  The fish was fresh, the rolls were great, and they even let you order half rolls.  Not just for your last roll, but on any roll you want.  They have a great selection of specialty rolls, and nigiri.

I live down the street from here and it's always packed so I decided to give it a try. 

It's a really small place. Maybe 6 tables and a sushi bar. My husband and I sat at the bar and went with all you can't eat. For dinner it is only $25 a person! Half a roll ranges from $6-$9 so if you're going to eat a decent amount, AYCE is the way to go. That is such a great deal so right away I was thinking this food is going to suck. I'm happy to report it as pleasantly surprised! 

The food did not take very long at all, especially since we were at the bar so the sushi chefs just handed the food to us as they made it. I highly recommend anything fried - tempura, sandwich roll, etc. That was by far my favorite. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the best sushi or freshest I've had, but the price and customer service was excellent."}

It's small and never really crowded. Some people may look at it and wonder why but to me it means that they don't need smoke and mirrors to entertain would be customers. I dig sitting at the bar. The chefs will put on anything on the TV. It's a plus during baseball season because you can stuff your face for 9 innings while catching a game. Everything is good.

Now if it was a private party I understand but good customer service leave a sign up or just communicate with customers. Pretty disappointed. Heading to sushi wa instead."}

BUT I cannot decide what was colder the restaurant or the service. This was my first time here and i will definitely give it a second try given how amazing the food was and the price was reasonable. I work in the service industry and understand the importance of customer service. But if i get the same result the second time, the fact of there being bad servoce might just be enough to deter me from ever going back. Disappointing."}

Henderson is littered with sushi places but the good ones never offered AYCE. I understand that but sometimes I'm just in the mood to OD on sushi. 

Years ago they was offering a special for that time being of AYCE sushi lunch for $18.95. We took a chance since we didn't find any good AYCE sushi nearby. This place is literally a hole in the wall, being in the vicinity of a grocery store and surrounded by fast food joints such as Taco Bell & Dairy Queen. Don't let that stop you from visiting. What it lacks in trendy decor, they make it up with a good variety of sushi.

I always take and suggest Sushi Bay for guests looking for AYCE sushi. It's not expensive and the variety will make anyone happy. My sister is a diabetic and they offer enough riceless sushi for her and for anyone looking to cut down on carbs. Sushi is never formed with too much rice (like some other AYCE sushi places) and when I mean variety I mean the sushi isn't replaced with 1 ingredient  and is renamed. 

I always coming when the "rush hour" is over for AYCE sushi. If it's too busy you can eat at the bar. I recently ate here for their lunch special too. Their lunch special isn't anything special but is priced for a quick healthy lunch. Some reviews complain about the host/hostess and to be honest perhaps they don't want to talk so much because maybe their english isn't perfect. Who cares though? I'm not paying to talk to them. 

Will be coming back in the future just as long as they keep up the good work."}

Luckily we just didn't walk out without paying that's how terrible the service was. Plus charging an automatic gratuity was insane when it was mostly babies there and only 2 adults!!!!

I've been here before and liked the food.  It was close so we said why not?!

It's a hole in the wall type place on the corner of Pecos and Warm Springs.  Not very many seating, however, every time I've visited the location, I've always been seated right away.  Because of the small floor, they usually have only one server at a time.  If there are big parties, it can take a while before they come to your table.  

We usually get the same thing:  All you can eat for $23.95 per person.  Can I just say how wonderful of an idea that is!!  You get an entire menu, front and back to choose from.  I usually go for the side orders and if any sushi, from the Nigiri section I strongly feel getting your money's worth is important.  I don't ever want to be weighed down by lots of rice.  Here's somethings I love from the menu:

Shrimp Tempura:  batter is light and super crispy.  The dipping sauce is lightly salted and sweet at the same time.  Works well with the shrimp.

Teriyaki chicken:  comes in a cast iron mini skillet sizzling!  It sits on a best of sliced onions and Teriyaki sauce.  Love!

Bacon Wrapped Scallops:  Small little bite sizes of mini scallops and salty bacon.  Yum!

Sweet Amaebi Shrimp nigiri sushi:  Comes with 2 per order, per customer.  The shrimp is sweet.  Works well as a bite sized sushi piece.  This dish is served with the deep fried heads as well.  That was a huge surprise, not into eating shrimp heads so I was kind of grossed out LOL.

Soft Shell Crab:  The whole crab, battered, deep fried and cut into 4 huge pieces.  You can eat the whole crab.  The tangy and lightly spicy dipping sauce really works well.

Fried Gyoza:  Pork filled fried dumpling with a great soy dipping sauce.  

Hamachi Nigiri:  Love this white yellowtail sushi option.  Not too much of a fishy taste to it.  Really good!

If you're ever in the area, come down and get your sushi fix on.  Overall, this place is actually pretty good.  I would definitely come back and get the All You Can Eat option!!"}

I understand that they don't want people taking advantage of the "all you can eat" price, but I think this place was a bit extreme.  I paid separately for the roll we ordered that we didn't like, which seemed like the best option to get the waitress to stop getting upset and explaining the all you can eat policy over and over.

The waitress (older Korean woman) pointed to a table so we sat there. We ordered something a la carte and two waters and the waitress gave us a weird vibe like she was pissed.

When they walked out, she blurted something out to the sushi men. Let's just say i know their language pretty well.....n what she said was not nice. I have  gone there a couple times n they actually talk smack a lot about their customers. Some customers seem like they come there a lot based on what i hear from the conversation.

The chefs weren't even trying it seems, and the place was practically empty. I was a loyal customer for 5+ years, but with so many sushi options in this town there is no reason to settle for poor quality and mediocre service."}

My son ordered a roll, after eating the first piece realized that he did not like it. After pushing it to the side the waitress comes up and says that we have to eat it. I nicely said that my son did not like it. And instead of just taking the lost on 1 cucumber maki roll responds with, "well why did you order it then" and forced us to eat it. The rest of our meal we were being intensely watched by the chefs ensuring that we finish all of the items we ordered....which we always do."}

We ordered AYCE which was priced fairly well considering the competition from other sushi places around town. Our waitresses were very friendly and very on top of taking orders and keeping our cups full. 

We started with house salad, poke salad and a crazy jalapeno. Everything was seasoned well and plated with finesse. From there we ordered Valley of fire, 911, ichiban, Hawaiian, cherry blossom, and sandwich rolls. Every single roll was made with care and true passion, it showed in every bite. I have zero complaints on anything we ordered.

Over all this restaurant was just perfect. It is a hidden gem that is going to become my new go to sushi place. 5/5 we'll worth every penny!"}

Located right next to a port of subs and some Thai food restaurant. I walked in and was immediately greeted by the employee's which made me feel welcomed. The restaurant is super small maybe too many tables idk not sure but it felt really small, maybe need to rearrange the layout that might help. 

I went to go sit at the bar and asked if they had a lunch menu and sure enough they did!  Better yet they had lunch specials. They have an excellent variety of specials such as bento boxes,  chef's pick of sushi , and a poke lunch special which are all in between $10 to $12 dollars . Also they do have an all you can eat (A.Y.C.E) option as well. Or you can order al a carte. 

I chose the the salmon bento box lunch special which was $11.50 I believe I could be wrong but either way it was amazing salmon was moist , the tempura was tasty. And the miso soup helped to wash it all down. I also had a spicy tuna nigiri and the sushi chief hooked it up ! Lol 

My overall experience was excellent, the employees were super friendly even the sushi chief was nice ! They play good music have excellent variety of rolls if your ever in area I suggest sushi bay ! I do recommend Go Go Go!!!"}

We brought our 7 month old and 3 year old with us and the wait staff was very welcoming to both kids. 

The sushi was so fresh and quick to be delivered to us. We were greeted immediately upon arrival and when we left. We got the all you can eat for $23.95 for dinner and it was so worth it. All of are food was delivered fast but evenly spaced out so we didn't have too much on the table at once. They also give you the option on the all you can eat menu for half/full or hand roll so my husband and I got to try more. I wasn't a huge fan of the batter they use to fry the soft shell crab/rolls in but everything else I got was delicious.

Since their AYCE menu is so vast I've tried everything I've dared to eat and have not been disappointed. Their poke bowls are on point. You can decide how hot you want the sauce to be which is awesome. Hawaiian roll is also another favorite and their dessert selection is good (frozen cheesecake squares yum!)

Great staff.  The sushi chefs are friendly and funny.  Always good to have a chat with some good peeps while downing some raw fishes.

They are also open til 1 am on the weekends!  WTF!!!  I dunno where in California you can get sushi past 10 pm!  Not only all you can eat but late night too???  Be still my heart peoples...

When they do get slammed it gets a little backed up, but that is understandable for such a tiny hole in the wall place. The sushi chefs are great and a lot of fun to chat with as well.

On to the sushi....Paradise roll..it's like a redneck of sushi rolls but it is damn delicious. .. shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado with their spicy yum sauce and coconut flakes. My personal favorite is Romeo...it's a less hectic and more spicy take on the Paradise roll. There are so many different choice and variations of sushi on the menu. The fish is relatively fresh and the prices are reasonable, although by no means cheap. Paradise roll is $11.50 I believe, making it the most expensive roll on the menu. The chefs are also accommodating...if you ask them to recreate a roll you like from elsewhere, they will do it.  Being that I am such a fan of Sushi Bay and highly recommend it..I am not sure what took me so long to write a review!"}

Ice cold beer, hot tea, cold sushi, hot soup. Their "chef sushi special" was fun; I can't eat a lot of "all you can eat", but this was perfect for a sushi noob. It was a nice "safe" California roll that I could go to between bites of "surprise" rolls.

This was pretty much perfect for me since I've only had sushi about 10 times so far after deciding I like it as an adult. So if you ask me what I like...I couldn't tell you. "the brown ones with the little red specks" or "the pink with the green and yellow" are typical answers I might give you. So I really enjoyed this for exploring.

The place is affordable and low-key. Nice place for lunch and nice place for a chill beer and sushi after work. 

I've never felt belchy or gross after eating here 3 times (and none of those times having any idea what the hell I was eating) which is a pretty good mark for me. I'll probably definitely go back when I want some cheap good sushi."}

OK!  If you are going for all you can eat sushi, then this probably means  you like the complicated so many flavor and stuff type of sushi. In this case, this place is just fine and you cannot go wrong.

1.  For a lunch place, it is perfect. Just the right size, not too crowded and roomy.

2.  Parking - Easy Strip Mall Parking.

3.  Car Wash - No, just kidding, but hey, you can drop your car off at the Chevron across the street , have it washed and enjoy a good sushi meal.

3.  Pricing - Just right at 21.99 all you can eat.

4.  Quality - No bad!  Now I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and prefer the basic Nigiri Sushi style with the seafood on top of rice.  However, I can and will enjoy the American invented sushi rolls and here they are tasty and inventive.  the Screaming Orgasm is very tasty and different!  I enjoyed everything that we ordered!

5.  Service - Just right amount of service. Just right amount of help!

Side note, being of asian persuasion, I am quite sensitive to the cleanliness of the bathroom. The ole adage is that if the bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is clean, the food is bad.  Well, here,the bathroom is quite good and the food is good. So, it is a Win-Win!!!

Frankly I'm glad it did because I like this place much better. 
We usually go for the ayce. We have so may favorite rolls that we order. One of the things we order is the salmon nigiri. It's a large price of fish on rice. Most places it's the opposite, big piece rice with a small piece of fish on top.
Lately I've been wanting to eat less rice so I'll order the johnny roll and the seafood salad. My other favorite is the tuna hand rolls. One of the things I loved about this place when I fist started coming here was that you can get half rolls for ayce. I mean how great is that?! You can try stuff you've never had before and if you don't like it you're not stuck with a whole roll to force down and if you just like variety you can get more without filling up to fast. I love this place."}

1. The variety - So many sushi restaurants just don't have that much variety. So many places have like 20 rolls to choose from and that's it. This place has at least 50! at least...
2. The imagination - There are so many combonations of veggies, rice, and fish. Other places have the same ol' rainbow roll or unagi with avocado roll. This place has amazing combos. the Dynomite is amazing! I've never heard of this anywhere! (The name may be the same but the actual roll is completely unique)
3. It's delicious - I haven't met a roll here that I though, ick or Meh.  I've been places and ordered the Spider roll (see the same ol same ol) and it be kinda gross like it was sitting there for a day. But not here, the food is all tasty!
4. It's not expensive - It's pretty reasonable! even the fancy rolls aren't expensive.
5. Pleasent atmosphere - this is where I would go for lunch with friends, not dinner with a hot new date and a Vegas show.
All in all, this place is AMAZING!!!"}

I have been going to this joint for 3 years now...3 years people....in Vegas that is a life time. You have to remember if a restaurant sucks it'll shut, especially sushi bars. 

This is a great mum and dad style place, it can seat up to maybe 30 people, so make sure you get there early for lunch as it totally fills up.

The chefs always welcome everyone through the door with a loud "Irashaimasu", which is always a bit of a shock especially if you are in the middle of a conversation, and of course everyone in the restaurant swivel in their seats to see the new arrivals; and after the usual "hello" back from the patrons, everyone one turns back to their yummy sushi.

And finally in my long winded and slightly off track way we get back to the food.....oh dear god....if i had to pick something to eat for the rest of my life it would be their spicy tuna rolls...they are sooooooo good! All of the rolls are beautifully made and presented, the fish is always super fresh and if you get a seat at the bar the chefs will show you all the different uncooked wobbly bits of fish that they use in their creations.

They have the usual sushi and sashimi fare which are all totally excellent, but they have a "special" menu including the fabled "touchdown" rolls (if i told you what was in it, i would have to kill you!) and for those on an low carb diet, rice free sushi!!! Amazing!

What else can i say about Sushi Bay? The hot green tea, is fresh and constantly refilled by the super attentive waitstaff and the Edaname is fab with just the right amount of sea salt.

Go try it....I've eaten in many different sushi restaurants in Vegas and this place is defiantly the best. Great food, great atmosphere, great staff and all for a great price!"}

The food is great but the Service is well below standards... specifically one of the Sushi chefs. Many times I've gone in only to receive dirty looks, sometimes not even a glance or a welcome. I usually sit with the other chef but even so I feel uncomfortable. This evening I noticed him saying things in his native language to a server and they both looked and laughed at me. I asked the other chef ( who goes by Jay and is a wonderful guy) if the other one doesn't like me.  He obviously wanted to save face and said "he's just busy". I felt unwanted even though only 3 other people were there. I will happily find another place that is more welcoming my business."}

The sushi is great , but the waitress isn't the nicest. We would spend 200 to 300 a month at this place. Because me and my boyfriend love the sushi here. We will not be going back after last nights experience. We go here often, but havent tipped much because of the rude waitress. A few weeks ago we ate here, and my bf had a small sip of my coke. He didn't order coke though and the waitress snapped down his throat telling him he couldn't sip my coke... I understand about non all you can eaters eating all you can eat. I know that is not allowed. But it was a soda... like one dollar soda, and he only had a small sip... She scared us so bad yelling at us. If she would of said nicely. He can't drink your coke that would of been fine... So we were like woah...that was bad.... But we gave it one more shot and ate here again thinking maybe she had a bad day or something.  Well as soon as I sat down. The waitress confronted me yesterday and flat out asked me " Why don't you tip more?" I was like woah... I told her the food is great thats not the problem. She said I notice you come here ALOT and don't tip a lot. Then she told me basically I couldn't eat there anymore unless I tipped more. I was like WOW never in my life has that happened anywhere I have ate at. She said and your bf or whatever never tips either. I was like wow so insulting! Then I decided to stay and eat. She was like oh so you decided to stay? I felt horrible!! I stayed and ate and even tipped 7 dollars but  I won't be going back. I am now going to eat at sin city sushi. It is such a shame because we were loyal customers who brought friends often. We were probably most of their business. Oh well...."}

Also to the start of the evening we let the waitress know we've never been there and  asked how it all worked.  She gave a mediocre explanation and didn't whip out the lotto pencil to check off the item you want.  After coming back a second time asking if we've decided I said yes.

I must say, this place is one of the least expesive all you can eat sushi places in town and the food doesn't dissapoint. 

The friendly head sushi chef recommended the paradise roll and it truely was one of my favorite sushi roll ever. It had a coconut shrimp with shreaded coconut on top. I'm normally not a fan of coconut but it went really well with the roll. 

I alway base my rating on the nigiri's and I must say, they were nice and thick with little rice. I can eat the salmon all day. Definitely get your money's worth here. The server was extremly nice, always checked on me if everything was o.k. and refilled my drinks promptly. 

I would rate this place higher than the other places in town and although I live accross town, the cheapest price in town definitely will make the drive worth it."}

We're locals and we've been here twice now for the ayce lunch ($20 is an awesome price). The food is great, the service is fantastic. The glasses are never empty, they pick up plates very promptly. The menu is awesome. Of the appetizers, you can't go wrong with snow crab or shrimp tempura, and I'd especially recommend the bacon wrapped asparagus.. It's phenomenal. Favorite roll is the paradise roll  -shrimp tempura with spicy sauce and ccoconut  - SO AMAZING. Other standouts are the ichiban roll (with lobster), the Johnny roll (I forget what's in it but it's wrapped in cucumber and it's awesome lots more great rolls but those are our faves. They even had our favorite Korean blackberry wine Bohae bokbunjajoo. It was a fantastic treat for my birthday. There's a particular sushi guy that has been there both times we went in, a younger guy who speaks some english, and he's awesome. My fiancé is a pro with chopsticks and I suck, and he gave me the kiddie chopsticks with the clip, and we had a good laugh about it. Great food, great service.. You can't ask for much more.

Keep in mind that it is a "hole in the wall" joint and it can get pretty crowded and service can get slow (depending on how many waitresses they have/restaurant traffic). I would suggest calling ahead before getting there."}

Let me explain so we used to be super regulars and so on....until one day the waitress walks over and says I need to tip more...oh no its gets better...my bf ordered a water and he took one sip of my coke and she yelled at him for it! YELLED! Could not say nicely it wasn't allowed?

If there was a choice in putting zero stars, that's what I would've put for last nights dinner. I called a head of time to see how much AYCE was for adults and children and whomever answered the phone said $25 for adults, $12 for 10 and up and $6 for 5 year olds. 

As soon as we got there, my family of 7 were seated, and then ordered AYCE sushi dinner, so a total of 9 sushi rolls and Tuna Poke salad and few more appetizers for the first round. As soon as the Chef (main) saw what we had ordered he asked the waitress how much did you tell them the price for dinner for AYCE. As soon as she told him, he changed the price. Which was unacceptable, but we decided to stay since we were already there. 

As we were waiting, the SF Giants game was on and we asked the Chef if he can change the channel and he says "no we don't that" with a very rude attitude. Normally I don't take that kind of customer service, but I was hungry and was already there, so we stayed. 

As soon as we got our Tuna Poke. I can automatically smell the tuna. Which I'm sure wasn't fresh, just by the smell of it and I've been to almost every sushi bar in Henderson and never smelled and tasted the way Sushi Bay's is. Just as I take a bite of tuna, it was very stringy and tasted horrible. So that didn't work out. Then we got everything else, but we ordered 5 baked tempura sushi rolls which was rock hard almost as if they meant to over cook it to make it that way. 

They kept brining sushi we didn't order to our table and also had skipped 3 sushi rolls that we ordered and they said we had them. The first thing I order when I go to a sushi bar is Salmon Skin roll, so I know for sure they didn't make me that. No to mention, they never checked on our table and kept having to ask for water. 

At this point, I was already aggravated and not only did this place ruin my dinner, they ruined my ability to try new places. At least I know Island Sushi and Sushi Mon are still there to satisfy my cravings as I've been going to those sushi bars for years. Who ever is reading this, DONT COME HERE. Their fish is never fresh. TRUST ME when I say this. GO TO ISLAND SUSHI or SUSHI MON. 

I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE. EVER."}

Their cooked rolls aren't impressive, very mediocre. Their raw fish are so obviously not fresh.

As soon as I put that piece in my mouth, I spit it out and the waitress brought me more napkins lmao. I also ordered the tuna poke which had dry ass tuna mixed with lettuce. This poke was disgusting. I spit that out too. 
We ordered steamed shumai and the crazy jalapeño. The shumai appeared to be the same ones you buy in the freezer section of an oriental market. It tastes like it had been in the freezer for years. The crazy jalapeño was unnecessarily huge and packed with a stick of cream cheese and spicy tuna. It was disgusting.

So this is my 3rd review! Yes I've gone back here, not because I wanted to, but because I had no choice because my co-workers insisted on coming here since we were on lunch, it was nearby, cheap and of course I was hungry. 

Of course that "Korean" chef was there, the rude one, the tall one, the loud one, the one that stares and talks smack about all his customers. I try not to associate with the help there because by now, I know how they work. All I did was wait for my food and try to get out of there as fast as I can. 

First thing we order, is the Poke. Mind you, we went there on a Thur and I guess that's when most fish arrive fresh that same day and the poke was smelly and stringy. Then I ask for Salmon Skin Roll w/ less rice and that tall "Korean" not Japanese Chef says NO, they cannot do that since it's a part of the sushi and how they make it. I tell him, oh you mean you wanna get your customers full from all the rice you put so they don't order anymore sushi? Then it's obvious he's taking smack about me to his people. I've gone to plenty of sushi bars that always did that for me and anyone else whom asked for it. Had to ask for water and napkins countless times. Handed the lady my Debit and walked out. 

Of course I find out that I left my Debit card there, so I called there and I said I left my Debit card there and the lady who answered (CHRISTINE) if that's her real name, said yes it's here come pick it up, then hung up the phone before I can even ask any questions. So I called back and asked her why the hell did she hang up on me? she say's I'm very busy and have no time to talk on the phone if it's not regarding any orders. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS??? I asked for her name and she hesitated and asked why? finally she said her name was Christine. LOL I'm sure it's not real. THIS PLACE IS A CIRCUS. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE, I don't know why I even bother still coming here. 

The 1 star is for the "decent" sushi they had that day, I'll admit."}

Especially not worth the AYCE price which is $25 for dinner. I started off with Tuna Poke and miso soup. Tuna smelt horrible, don't even know why I bothered trying it. As soon as I tried a piece of it, it was so chewy and stringy. The soup was cold as soon as I got it. 

Ordered a bunch of deep fried tempura sushi rolls, and as soon as I got them, they were over cooked and was very hard. As I was waiting for the rest of my rolls, I had to ask for my own water a couple times. They never brought out the rest of my order. I was already upset with my food at this point. The VERY rude chef always had attitude when I asked for different rolls and let him know my concerns, sadly he's the main chef in that place, why? I'm not sure, things need to change at that place and most of all, their quality of fish, needs to be fresh. Got up and left unhappy and dis satisfied with my dinner. NEVER AGAIN TO SUSHI BAY. I prefer Sushi-Mon, island sushi, I aka sushi or even sushi Ka."}

I've had Krab with a K before but not Phish with a Ph (as in PHOOEY!) A group of friends and I went to The Ka on a Wednesday night and they were closed for construction so we Yelped for an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi (AYCES) place near by. Here is a prime example as to why you cant rely on a Four Star rating when there are only seven ratings. Of the ratings, three were from locals, four from visitors. We Vegas locals take the AYCES trend for granted, but most major cities don't have a lot of AYCES places. When a FOUR STAR review starts like this:

"7 words...  All-you-can-eat-sushi-to-order! Wow.  Not the best sushi I have ever eaten but when it's all you can eat for $21.95, what can you really complain about?"

can you really rely on a review like that? NOT ME! I can excuse the visitors that are enchanted by their first AYCES experience (And who can't? It's like the time you popped your cousin's cherry at church camp!), but I've got seven words for that reviewer: "Glutton! It's all about the raw fish!" 

But it's the locals and those that call this "the best in Vegas" and "high quality" that leave me speechless. For the woman who has been going to this joint for three years (THREE YEARS!!!) here's a bit of advice: Get a date, have him take you out to another respectable AYCES place like The Ka, Sushi Mon, or I Love Sushi, and DISCOVER THERE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD OUT THERE. Good God, it's like a Mormon who has his first Silver Bullet and thinks he's found the Nectar of the Gods. WALK THE TWO MILES TO THE KA and discover fishy yumminess. You could use the walk after eating so damn much!

Look, there are literally over 100 AYCES joints in Las Vegas, and they range between $21.95 and $27.95. There are some decent places in the $21.95 range, but hell, it's SUSHI, pay the extra few dollars and go to a GREAT PLACE LIKE THE KA!

The ambiance was the same minimum standard in the valley. It's a good thing I didn't come to eat the decor, because there wasn't any to look at, let alone eat. The sushi bar had 7 stools and they could seat another 30, maybe. At least the place was clean.

But let's get down to the REAL reason we are here: TO CONSUME A TON OF RAW FISH. Why else are you going to get so excited to eat at an endless trough for $21.95? If you want to just stuff your gullet, go to one of the Station Casinos' Feast Buffet for 2/3 the price and roll yourself home. WE ARE HERE FOR THE FISH, BABY!

Well, at least, that is why I WENT there, but I won't be going back there for the fish. My #1 marker for a good sushi joint is the Salmon, and my girlfriend (former LA food critic) goes by the Yellowtail. While the Yellowtail was passable (but still not "good"), the SALMON SUCKED. Wrigley's makes a much tastier chewing gum and it ain't $21.95, either. You know how good salmon looks, that beautiful orange color with as little of the white marbling as possible? Well, apparently they don't at Sushi Bay. Not only was it heavily marbled which made it less than favorable texture, but it had a lot of that brown stuff which is too close to the skin and is just out-right chewy. BLECH. Sadly, it didn't even have that good salmon taste. It was very bland and watery. And they are STRICT and annoying as hell constantly telling you (maybe even threatening you) that they'll charge you for anything you don't eat, so I got stuck eating 10 pieces of bad salmon. Grrrr. 

The menu has a good variety of rolls, but that's typical for almost every sushi place in Vegas these days. The rice was mushy and they use WAY TOO MUCH RICE in the rolls. Only a few were passable. I never get Lobster Rolls in anything but the very expensive joints because THINK ABOUT IT: do you think they can afford to give you GOOD lobster roll for anything less than $20 a roll? Hell no, most places are using the lowest quality lobster just so they can say they have one. And no surprise here at Sushi Bay, it sucked. And of course they are going to suck, as the quality of the fish is rotten. Even the seaweed in the miso soup was chewy, not the light, delicate stuff found in good sushi joints.

Look, you don't have to take my word for it. There are six other people who recommend this place. If you've read my review and the others and you still want to check it out, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to do so. And then come back here and mea culpa and we can go to The Ka together and have some REALLY GOOD SUSHI THERE.

Now, bring me a bucket!"}

I ended up getting the philidelphia roll, a side order of calamari tempura, and miso all to go. 

The miso was good, just a bit high of a price for such a small amount. The fried calamari didn't take take long to stink up inside my car. If calamari is done correctly it has little to no fishy smell and I live less than 2 miles from this place. I think the (very polite and friendly) waitress gave me the wrong sauce for my tempura. She gave me an extremely oily and spicy dip. Just double check the sauces they give you before you leave. 

On to the roll...Honestly, what is it about LV and their unusually small sushi rolls? I have been now to 3 sushi spots of varying price and all small! These rolls were teeny tiny. The quality of the roll didn't impress me either. Note: They do use a good balance of rice to filling ratio but I was definitely still hungry after that. 

If anyone knows of a sushi spot around where the rolls are larger than a quarter than please send the info my way!!

At the end of it I paid $15 to still be hungry, and eat fishy calamari

As much as I love a local small chain sushi spot I will not be back. On to the next spot!"}

A party of two who came after us were seated, serviced, and had food before us. 

At this point an hour has gone by without us every being asked what we would like to eat, so we left. 
The sad part is the main chef kept looking at us and knew we weren't being serviced. It's only my second time, but my brother and his family have been going here for several years. We walked out after another twenty minutes of not being greeted at the table. Terrible customer service."}

This establishment used to be a favorite go to spot for myself and family. The quality, portions and service has declined gradually over the past few years. 

The visit before this one should have been my warning. I fell extremely ill after having dinner there with my brother.  I decided to give it another try today and was disappointed yet again. 

The salmon skin roll was so tough - almost jerky like that I had to swallow the pieces whole (They charge you for leftovers). 

The tuna poke portions slowly decreased over the years but has been so tasty that it didn't matter too much. They must have gotten a few complaints because they added bagged mixed lettuce to the poke to make it seem like a larger portion. 

I was so hungry that I decided to stick with cooked foods and they couldn't even get that right. 

I've never been a "race" girl but I kinda took it there when it was completely OBVIOUS that they were treating everyone else different (better)  than me. The waitress went around 4 different times filling water and never filled my glass. The portions of food were larger at everyone else's table and not mine. I'm hoping it wasn't a race issue because we have enough of that going on in society. 

At this point (because it really hurts me to give this review) I've decided to declare this as an off day. I'm not sure if I'll visit again because they've been so inconsistent. I really hope they get it together because their "good" days were truly amazing!!"}

I was lucky enough to try a couple of his "specials" and, in looking back, I should've asked if they had an omakase option because I'm sure it would be amazing coming from such a talented and imaginative sushi chef.

There were also enough sushi chefs working that I never had to wait more than 30 seconds for the next thing to come out on my AYCE order.  I prefer mostly the nigiri and a few standard rolls so I can't comment on some of the speciality rolls they offer.  I also think the lunch AYCE might be one of the cheapest in town at $17.95.  I will definitely be back soon for lunch."}

the bacon wrapped shrimp potion was comical... take a look at the picture... the picture makes the plate look huge but that thing was not more then 3x3

The tornado roll was good though, however the lobster roll was a joke, the only reason I ordered it was because of the picture, either they play favorites to regulars or they completely became stingy with how they make their stuff..

Half way through dinner I started feeling nauseous and slowly lost my appetite. I had at least half of my steak, but then felt like I hit a wall and was done.

Needless to say, I spent all yesterday morning with the porcelain king, and the only thing I can think of I got sick from the dinner from Claim Jumper. 

Just be careful eating here."}

I went to the northwest location several years back with a giftcard and was terribly underwhelmed. My mom recently  reviewed the menu online and convinced me to go for dinner at the Green Valley location. We were met with a lengthy wait for a table, but stuck it out. Only to be ignored at our table for ten minutes before a drink order was taken. We should have left, but we had invested so much time already. The online menu wasn't current and the entrée she wanted wasn't available. A similar item was $3 more. Totally parched we finally received our drinks. The diet was flat. The iced tea was served with a rotting lemon. Then, later her entrée, came with a rotten potato. They switched it out, but obviously rotten food shouldn't be prepared, let alone leave the kitchen. Cheese, bacon and butter was requested with the potato, and the cheese was some sort of liquid. Ew. The rest of our meal was edible, but underwhelming and overpriced. Plus, we left with upset stomachs."}

So a few days ago when a quick dinner decision was required for a party of 5 adults (3 visiting from other states with no CJ exposure) and a toddler, Claim Jumper was the answer.  

We arrived at 5pm on a weekday and were able to sit in the Saloon and enjoy happy hour drink prices.  

There was too much food ordered to review here - so I will stick to my general consensus of our group.  THE MEAL WAS GREAT, ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, and OVERALL WE HAD A GREAT TIME!   

Some food tips here:
1.  Everyone who ordered shrimp dishes loved them!  The western BBQ shrimp wrapped in bacon was a HUGE HIT.  So much so, that my father-in-law from Ohio returned the NEXT DAY and ordered it again!!  For real!  

2.  The chicken fried steak is not exactly what Southerners are used to.  It was decent, but not going to blow you away.  It's Las Vegas - skip the chicken fried steak here people!  

3.  The potato cakes were the biggest hit.  Order them as a side dish.  You won't be disaapointed.  

4.  The rotisserie chicken which they specialize in was just average.  My father-in-law is a rotisserie chicken man and he said "I've had a better rotisserie at Costco than here."  Now, he still ate the whole chicken, so it must have been good enough for him.  

5.  Hit up the Saloon during Happy Hour - they have over 15 food items to chose from on discount, and more than 15 drink specials.  It will save you lots of money!!"}

We were treated like ROYALTY! The chef was so incredible and very entertaining. And the food? The BEST!! I ordered the filet mignon, and I have never had a steak melt like butter in my mouth! The shrimp, noodles, and fried rice were also incredible.

Such an amazing evening. Thank you for making my birthday so memorable!"}

I've been here about 4 times and every sushi dish and roll I've ordered has been very good to excellent. The not so good news: So far every dish Ive had not sushi related has been mediocre to poor. Once I had a noodle dish that was obviously made the day before and reheated. It was sticky, clumped together and tasteless. Tonight I had a fired won ton appitaizer. At first glance it looked nice, but then I noticed the lettuce it was served on was wilted and brown. If the won tons were good I won't not have cared, but they were so bad I couldn't eat them. The cream cheese inside was cold and pasty while the won ton themselves were tough as shoe leather. Again obviously made the day before and heated up and served. This place has so much potential, but the corners they are cutting is going to make people stop coming here. I may come again for the sushi, but Ill never order anything else here."}

I had my family in town for my bday and wanted to have a nice birthday dinner. We read about the hibachi and family style menu and wanted to do family style since there were 7 of us (all adults). We were greeted very quickly, we opted for a table since they didn't have any hibachi open at the time for 7 people, it wasn't too crowded but there were a few people. We were seated in the sitting area and our waitress AUDREY came to get drink orders. Tried to sneak in a question but ignored me and left. Came back with drinks and asked if we were ready to order, when I said I had a question about family style since that is what we were interested in, she didn't even let me finish as she rudely spoke over me and said we don't do that, then I showed her on the menu where is said family style online and she said that they didn't do that we all had to order indivisdually and then share (that's completely fine portions are huge, I just wished she would have explained it or atleast let us ask questions without being bothered). She then brought out the soups, rather than giving each person one she just told the person at the end. "Pass them down" again with a huge attitude. Same thing with the salad. After she started bringing out the entreees we saw it was a lot and wanted to cancel one of the sides (vegetable fried rice) she said we couldn't do that since the order was already placed again with the attitude. We ate and tried to make the most of our time after all my family came in from California and Arizona for my bday and we were less than thrilled with our service. Like I said the food was phonomenal but AUDREY's service was horrific! Really going to debate on ever returning, especially to this location."}

The waitress barely said two words to us and didn't even let me know what types of soups they had when I ordered the dinner special ( which comes with a soup and salad). No interaction with us at all. We should've had the hibachi which was packed and at least I know the food is fresh. I heard this place was the "best" Japanese cuisine in town and it was far from it.

Anyway, the salad was OK. Wasn't that great, I probably will skip it next time. Wasn't fresh... the soup was delicious! Our cook was funny and was very cool. He cooked our food really good. I had the shrimp and New York steak, husband had the lobster, clams and steak. Lobster was very good and he said the clams were rich. I loved the veggies too. We will definitely be going back :) 

**I gave them four stars for the guy who rushed me and the salad. Maybe next time it will be better experience:)"}

They have pretty classic teppanyaki at very affordable prices along with a fairly large menu which includes sushi, Thai, noodles, and rice selections. 

The atmosphere is relaxed with everyone having fun catching shrimp in their mouth and watching knife tricks. On our last visit, we came before the dinner rush on a Friday night around 6, and by the time we finished dinner, the bar and waiting area were full with overflow into the dining area so reservations are recommended, especially on the weekends.

My rare filet was so good from my first visit, that I ordered it again on my second along with a the You and Me sushi roll. The sushi roll was OK, but there are still some other items that I want to try. The chefs season the vegetables and the fried rice very well, which are items usually not too memorable for me. They're very receptive to requests of adding flavors such as butter, garlic, or sauces. And I've noticed the chefs are more interactive with the guests in general compared to other places I've been.

The price of my hibachi dinner was under twenty dollars. As long as I can contain the amount of sake and Sapporos that I consume, my wife and I can get out of here full and paying around $60 for dinner which price I like and will keep us coming back on a regular basis."}

We had a female bartender who was VERY friendly! She had a unique name which I wish I remembered... 5 stars for her. I got a chicken quesadilla and a glass of the house Chardonnay. The quesadilla came out quickly which was awesome but the taste was below average. My bill for the quesadilla and Chardonnay ended up being $20.

We were seated and later greeted by our waitress. 
I asked for water with lemon, and a spicy cilantro margarita.
My guy ordered a Stella.

Our drinks took at least ten minutes to come.

The margarita was awesome.... Worth the wait.
Possibly the best margarita that I have ever had.
However, the Stella was lacking a little...and not as cold as it should have been.

One thing that really WOW'd me, was that they have a "baby" plate. 
That I had never seen before, or heard of at any other restaurant. 
And it's complimentary! 

It comes to the table, covered in saran wrap,  with a stick of cheddar cheese, a slice of turkey, apple sauce, and mini orange slices. 

Gourmet, no. But very thoughtful. It kept her busy.

We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza as an appetizer, along with the shrimp with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and slathered in BBQ sauce.

The pizza comes out, and it is the wrong size. That gets sent back.
The shrimp were quite good. I would have liked more cream cheese, and they could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce. 

My water was almost gone... Our waitress walked by us at least four times, and didn't refill it.

oh, and did I mention that I was the only one at the table that got water.......? 

When customers are drinking, aren't you suppose to supply water..? Or do these people not watch Bar Rescue.?

One water between the two of us was kind of lame. Between our waitress and the supervisor, they both said that they were "getting our drinks" 3 different times... 

Geez. THANK GOD IS WASN'T SUMMER.

We both ordered another round.
My margarita was again, awesome. However, the Stella this time was flat and gross.. The supervisor took it away.

The right size pizza comes out, and we munch on that. It was good, like better than Metro Pizza good. Happy with that. 

Still waiting for water refills.

I ordered the Frisco burger, on grilled sourdough, with thousand island and fires.
My guy ordered the beef ribs with fried Mac and cheese.

When our food finally arrives, I take a bite. Salty.
I take a drink of my water (waiting for ice cubes to melt, at this point).
I take a second bite to make sure that I'm not too loopy.... Still salty.
I pass it off to my guy (who loves salt) to try it. He thinks it's salty too. 

UGH. The fries were good though. Best fries ever.
A bite is taken out of the fried mac and cheese, and it's not hot.

I finally am able to flag down our waitress, and we let her know about the unsatisfying food. We take dessert (red velvet cupcakes) to go.

This was probably the longest dinner experience I have ever had in my life.

The check comes, and even with my over salty burger and the flat, warm beer taken off, our bill is $93. 

Yes, $93. My guy thought I was joking.

Red velvet cupcakes are Ok. Nothing Bundt Cakes has waayy better Red Velvet.

Stick to just drinks and appetizers here. Nothing else is worth it."}

I ordered the ultimate fish and shrimp dinner plate.  It came with 4 grilled shrimp, 4 battered shrimp, a piece of seasoned fish over a plate of fries.  Everything was overly salty, and unfortunately neither the cocktail or tartar sauce made it any better.  I asked for my fries well done, no salt and neither of it was cooked the way I like it.  The fish was overly seasoned and so needless to say, I got to taste of bit of everything and left unsatisfied and disappointed.  This dish came with a side dish and I ordered a cup of clam chowder that tasted like a cup of salt.  I just picked at the clams and left the whole cup of salt soup alone.   

Not my plate of seafood, so I'm not coming back.  Next time, I'll stick with a much better option at The Cheesecake Factory."}

For our main course, I had ordered the country fried steak and a house salad. The steak was cooked well, but it had a bit too much breading on it. My fiancé ordered the ribeye with a house salad- they were made very sloppy. Her ribeye was cooked as she ordered (medium rare). The food was all cooked very well, and I felt that it was totally worth the money. 

My problem I had here was the atmosphere. The restaurant was full of people who lacked manners and courtesy. The waiting staff seemed very rushed and wanted to turn the tables as fast as possible. I have memories of this place being very classy, but it seems to have dropped it's standards. While the food was good, I much would have taken it all to go."}

Compared to a similar dish at Chili's (Cajun Chicken Pasta), with a full chicken piece is on top of the pasta with thick cuts, CJ's was definitely inferior. That pretty much sums it up -- CJ's felt like a poor man's Chili's, despite charging a lot more. My server was quite friendly though, I will give them that."}

The serving of the food was pretty big which is great because it fit the price. The service has always been quite stellar, our server was always pretty great. The food, I would have to say is very good EVERY TIME.  Always up to a high standard.  

Today, however, was a whole 'nother experience. We came in with a party of 8 (technically we asked for a table for 7, plus a high chair for my baby nephew) and we asked if their happy hour was still going on.  We were informed that it was and it was a self-serve area by the bar.  So we just put two tables together and no biggie.  When we walked in the waitress, Olivia, assisted in putting together the tables.  Keep in mind, we only came in here because Cheesecake Factory had a long wait time and we wanted some desserts ONLY. Also, we came in a whole HOUR before the place closed.

Nevertheless, we sat down and we became interested in their happy hour menu which was advertised, not only in their website,  but also all over their tables.  So we decided to add some appetizers to our order.  After ordering, we were informed that the Happy Hour prices are no longer valid, despite the fact that it's clearly stated on ALL their tables and we got a happy hour menu.  She said they just changed the policy that day.  And that the advertised Happy Hour is only valid during the REGULAR Football Season.  Is she stupid?  The REGULAR season is not over until the SUPER BOWL!!!! Uhm, OKAY.  So we placed our orders still and I went to check with the hostess, she got the manager and I spoke to her and she informed us that she will honor the happy hour prices.  

Once we got our order, my sister accidentally spilled a bit of blue cheese in her coffee.  When I asked the waitress for a new cup, she ignored me.  When I asked for an extra bread for my nephew, who wanted more bread, she looked at me with an incredulous expression and paused to say, "uhm, yeah...okay."  She comes back to refill my coffee (without any spoons distributed to us, AT ALL) and proceeded to refill my sister's drink SEEING that there's white stuff floating all over it.  This whole time, she would go back forth to the bar and whisper with the bartender and they would roll their eyes.  

As she poured that coffee, I was astounded at her stupidity and her laziness.  I was just staring at her hoping she would notice and it would click that she should get a new cup.  NOTHING! She avoided eye contact with me and had this stupid smirk on her face like she's mocking us.  WHAT THE HELL!? I understand that she may be having a bad day, but proper customer service should still be practiced to keep professionalism intact.  Unfortunately, she had neither professionalism nor proper customer service etiquette.  I once again asked for the Manager and she could not even do anything but serve us the remainder of our order, in which time, my sister walked out because she couldn't take it anymore.  I have seen a lot of bad customer service in my time, but this has got to be the worst I have ever seen.  She should not be a waitress if she does not like having to wait on others.  It's absurd! It's insulting! And most importantly, it's unacceptable!! This will definitely not be the end of it.  We're great tippers as people who has worked previously in the service industry.  We know the value of a good service and we pay good money when we receive it.  But that service that we received did not even warrant a single penny.  They're lucky my brother in law is still very generous and still left a tip.  I cannot  believe that experience.  

For a company that is under Landry's Inc., who claim that they are the leader in Dining and Hospitality, this kind of service is truly unacceptable.  It's abhorrent and just plain idiocy to have those kinds of servers employed at such a facility.  I will not go back to this location EVER.  Lastly, the hostess, provided better customer service and professionalism that the manager and the two servers we came across during this visit.  WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They totally ruined my sister's 17 years anniversary with her husband!"}

I ordered the NY steak which came with soup, salad , vegetables and fried rice. I waited patiently for the grill to warm up so that the chef could start cooking, I didn't really need the frills and thrills of the teppanyaki show ( which was great btw) I just wanted to taste the food.

Moving on to the meat which I ordered medium well and ended up being medium and was tasteless , I tried dipping it in the sauce the chef gave me but those didn't taste so good. Now to my beloved vegetables, they were bitter as if the garlic had been burnt . So basically I paid $20 for a cup of onion soup which was the best thing I ate while I dined here. 2 stars for service added an extra star for soup. Not sure if I would return again."}

I asked for a vinaigrette for my salad, and I was brought a balsamic reduction/glaze. Way too sticky to dress a salad. The manager came by our table and did not offer to fix anything.

Food: 
First, the complimentary cheese bread is delish. I always get the strawberry lemonade, yummmm. 
So far I've had country fried steak- decent, Widow Burger- YUM, Shrimp Fresca- mmm mmm, Salmon- GOOD, 12oz Bone out Rib-eye- MY FAVE. Let's not forget the clam chowder .
Staff:
My waiter tonight was attentive (I forget his name, but ALWAYS kneels down to take orders) quick, knows the items well and quick. I've had some grumpy hosts in the past, but I'm sure everyone has their days. 
Pricing:
the food and quality is is priced reasonably.

I'll be returning"}

The pasta was pretty dry, but we got it at the lunch menu price so I was not too disappointed. Lace got the rotisserie chicken with potatoes and loved it.

The service was decent. The host mumbled us to our seat, and the waitress was nice but pretty quiet and was not around much.

I would definitely try this place again and get something else. The interior kind was decent, kind of log cabin style and would be great for big groups."}

Her choice was Claim Jumper! I was excited because I've heard good things about the food. 

We went on a Saturday around noon and surprisingly it was not that busy. They quickly seated us at a table. I loved the chairs, being a larger girl, I appreciate a large chair with no sides.  The decor was like a large dining lodge. I enjoyed the low lighting and decent choice of music. I did not get a chance to visit the bar, but it looked like an excellent place to check out during happy hour.

 Our waiter was on point. He quickly took our drink orders and left us to figure out what we wanted to order off of CJ's HUGE menu! ALL the things sounded good, but I ended up choosing the Original Tri-tip Dip sandwich with a side of seasoned fries. OMG was the sandwich good! There was tons of meat on it, as well as, caramelized onions, roasted peppers and smoked gouda on a French roll with au jus. I would go back just for this sandwich. The meat was tender and the onions were perfectly cooked. Dipping it in the au jus just perfected the bite you got.
My mother- in- law ordered the famous chicken pot pie with fruit on the side. She said it had a flaky crust. The chicken was moist, and the sauce was the perfect texture. Mom said she really liked it and even enjoyed the fruit that came with it.
My one sister-in-law choose the Widow Maker Burger with a side of seasoned fries. Let me tell you this thing was huge! She wasn't sure how she was going to get it in her mouth. It had a thick patty, smoked bacon, hand-battered onion rings, avocado, double-thick cheddar, mayo and red relish. She finished the whole thing! She said she loved it! I could tell she really did.
 My other sister-in-law had the giant stuffed baker. It was a giant baked potato stuffed with charbroiled chicken, roasted vegetables topped with melted cheddar and jack cheese. Also, a cup of alfredo sauce to drizzle on top. She finished the whole thing as well! She said the chicken was not dry at all and the potato was cook perfectly.

To my surprise Claim Jumper was very reasonably priced! The service was excellent. Our waiter even made sure to bring me a cup of the au jus to take home with the other half of my sandwich. I for sure will be coming back and am planning on bringing my husband in for happy hour. Claim Jumper has an amazing variety in their menu that will please everybody from your young child to your grandparents and in between!"}

For this visit I got their Sirloin Steak (medium rare), Baked Potato, and the Potato Cheddar Soup. Their bread is also great as well and i'm always looking forward for it. The Steak is really good and has an even amount of seasoning. The flavor from the seasoning just explodes in your mouth after each bite. Whenever I visit, I always get the Potato Cheddar Soup. I never regret getting it after each time. If you dip the bread in the soup, your taste buds will love it. 5/5!"}

Decor was nice. The food was very good and the chef was very entertaining. We both got filet mignon and I added chicken to my order. The meat was tender and cooked to order.

So I inquired and was told by the hostess that they do not have enough servers. 
I don't think that I should spent my evening waiting for a table because management does not know how to schedule, so we left.
This was the final straw for me and we will avoid this Claim Jumper location entirely from here on out."}

Among the chain restaurants, I am partial to Claim Jumper ( you can look at my reviews of their restaurants in Town Square and Downtown Vegas which were positive). We were coming from the movies at Green Valley Ranch with friends and thought we would have an informal, after the movie, dinner at the nearby Claim Jumper. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. We got seated right away and our server came to the table immediately taking our drink orders and bringing the oversized croissant bread plate for the table. The bread was the highlight of the meal. When at Claim Jumper, I usually get one of their salads and my wife usually gets a simple hamburger (bun, burger,  bun). I wanted to try something different, so I ordered their jambalaya. Our friends ordered salad and a burger. My jambalaya came first. Few minutes later, the burgers came. And then the salad. My friend took one bite out of his burger and we had to start looking for the server to send it back. He found it so over salted that it was virtually not edible. My wife wanted her burger medium rare with nothing on it. It came medium well with lots of lettuce and tomato. The server said it must have been someone else's burger. My friends wife also had to return her salad. As to the jambalaya, it was a good sized portion of what looked like a plate of linguine with 6 shrimp on the perimeter. I did find two small pieces of what looked like luncheon meat chicken mixed in with the pasta. There was absolutely no sausage. There were no vegetables that I could find. In my experience, jambalaya should have some kick to it. This was absolutely bland. I can't say that the dish was bad. But it certainly wasn't good. And it certainly wasn't anything that I would call jambalaya. They did make good on my friend's burger as well as my wife's burger. But they were brought to the table separately much later,  well after I had finished my meal. The salad came back even later than that. So while we all sat at the same table, we ate our meals separately. At the end of the meal, someone who I believe was a manager came to the table with the standard "so how was everything?" frankly, she should have known and come to the table with an apology. The bottom line for me: 1. When at Claim Jumper,  stick with ordering the salads, they do a good job with them in general. 2. Don't eat at the Green Valley Claim Jumper. Stick with town square and downtown. Those kitchens seem to work well. The Green Valley outlet, not so much."}

Have not been to a Claim Jumper before so we gave it a try. Definitely on the "won't do that again " list. 

Arrived about 8:30 it was pretty quiet and dark  inside. There was no wait which kind of made me wonder why on a Friday night. Walking past the food prep area two of the wait staff were laughing loudly after one dropped an F bomb in front of us. We were seated and we had a nice quiet meal that was on par with Denny's for a premium price. My salad was good other than they make croutons out of sweet corn bread. The combination of Blue Cheese dressing and yellow cake croutons was just wrong.

I ordered fish and chips because it's hard to mess that up. Wrong again. Over cooked fish jerky fried in rancid oil. All on a huge pile of soggy french fries. My wife got grilled shrimp and fillet Mignon. A different  waiter brought her plate and announced here's your sirloin and shrimp. He was told we ordered Fillet Mignon and grilled shrimp not Sirloin and Fried shrimp. He said Oh I think it's the same thing. No sirloin and fillet Mignon is not the same thing. He took the plate back to the kitchen. Our waiter came back and said whats the problem? We told her and she went to the kitchen and brought the same plate back with a side of grilled shrimp. I seated facing the kitchen and could see that her plate had not moved from when it was taken back. Now it had been sitting back there and was cold. Well we left knowing why it was nearly empty on a Friday night."}

Nice meal, really clean place and great servers! I am a real happy camper tonight. I've lived in Vegas for almost three years and there is almost always an issue when dining out. Not tonight! Only had the sirloin and salad with baked potato but everything was tasty and prepared perfectly. no A-1 sauce needed! No salad drowned in dressing! Garlic/ cheese bread was out of this world. Our waiter was Eddie and he was "spot on"!
Will definitely return. Thanks CJ!   As a note, I watched the clean up guy clean after each customer left and was very impressed with how much effort he put in to cleaning the tables booths and especially the floor. Good job "cleanup guy"!"}

The first time ever in my life I have to say the word f* and sh* in public. It reached my limit. At 3pm, I called and made a reservation for a party of 7 people at 7:30pm, then at 5:30pm I called again and said if I could change the reservation time to be sooner. I was told that YES. We arrived there at 6:35pm and was confirmed by the MANAGER that he doesn't have a table for me at that time, but would try to get a table for us in 10 min. While we were waiting, the other waitress told us that there was a table should be finished soon. 20 min has passed. We came back inside and realized that that table was taken by another party. We asked and that MANAGER told me that sorry but I gotta wait another 30 min. He said that: "i try my best to get the table for you, but because you called today to make reservation, while others had made reservations yesterday" WOW, really????? If it's full, why did you accept the reservation?? Because you are greedy????? I really need a better explanation of how we are treated like that. I wanna say sorry to the owner if I had said the bad words in the restaurant, but sorry I couldn't hold myself anymore. I couldn't ever imagine I was treated like that. We didn't come to eat for free. We deserve a better treat. Also, when I told him that if you wanted us to wait another 30min, why didn't he tell us at first? And why the other waitress told us that we could get the table in 10'. His answer was: " they don't know anything, they don't have the right to coordinate the table". My little 11-year-old cousin responded: " so why did you hire her if she doesn't know anything". In short, don't come to this replace if you don't wanna feet refused for the service. I wish Yelp had the option for Zero star, because they don't even deserve 1 star."}

Given we had a group of 25, I had fairly low expectations for the service, but they did an excellent job! From the time we sat down to the time we left it was just over two hours, which I think is pretty decent with a group that size! 

Now beware, the menu is huge. Pages on pages! I had my mind made up three different times and finally when put under some pressure, made a decision. I settled on the Frisco Burger and fries, a swiss cheese burger with thousand island dressing served on grilled parmesan sourdough (like toast, not a bun). It was tasty but nothing special. I actually wish it were served on a bun. If I were to describe my eating pace, I'd say its fairly normal (if I'm not lying, a little quicker than the average) and the bread quickly became soggy. The fries were also nothing special, thinly cut with a good crunch. Again, nothing wrong with the food but I could get a similar burger under ten bucks elsewhere. 

Overall, everyone in the group seemed content and no problems arose, but I think this is a one and done experience for me."}

By the acrobatics of your main entrée, the chef's one-liner puns, and of course, the sudden blazes of fire erupting from the famed onion volcano.

Although they do offer sushi and many other items on the menu, my boyfriend and I decided to go forth with the hibachi grill for an early v-day dinner. He made us reservations which was very convenient on a Saturday night. We were seated right away despite the small crowd in the waiting area. To start, we both got the HIBACHI BASIC ENTREE ($8.95) which consists of their house salad, onion soup, vegetables, and choice of rice/noodles. From there, you select your choice of your meat/seafood which range from $6.95 (chicken) to kobe beef ($48.95).

He got the chicken which the chef sliced up nicely into bite-sized pieces, and I got the shrimp which came to about seven pieces. Both were seasoned with lemon, garlic, and butter -- yum. The fried rice was good, too. However, the mixed veggies are not. That's probably why they give you ginger sauce for them to offset the blandness. Mine came with a lot of onions, and really, I think they're just there for decoration. The people next to us didn't really eat theirs either. To drink, I had a taro boba smoothie ($4.75). The boba balls were kind of hard, but the smoothie itself was the right amount of sweet.

Overall, great interactive experience and good place to take guests. Funny to watch people's reactions, especially the little ones. Warning: Don't be surprised if the chef attempts to throw food into your mouth not unlike a sea world trainer to a hungry seal."}

My fiancé asked for extra garlic on his chicken and he said "no only if you do a sake bomb" we laughed it off thinking it was a funny joke, my fiancé had work the next day and doesn't tolerate alcohol well so he said he can't so the chef said fine no extra garlic then really did not give him the garlic and was pretty quiet for the rest of the meal. It was weird. Then once he was finishing up cooking the server was seating another family at another hibachi table and I could see him being visibly very disgruntled mouthing and using tons of hands motions to the server. He finally gave up and rolled his eyes, I'm sure because he saw me watching him he explained he was so annoyed and so sick of servers not filling the small tables first because then he has to clean the larger tables. Overall he started off ok then seemed to be burnt out or annoyed. I'm not expecting the moon.. I don't even need all the fried rice hearts and onion volcanos, it's the same every time. I just want a professional chef/server that realizes they are in the service industry. I don't want to feel like an inconvenience."}

The cook came out and verified our orders and cleans the grill. He started with the fire show asking is how big of a fire we wanted. We responded "big".

The food was just ok. We ordered a variety of things like chicken, steak and shrimp. Our orders came with vegetables and a choice of fried rice or noodles. The noodles were not that good.

For our lunch we had the Chopped Cobb salad 4/5 which comes with grilled chicken, crumbles of bleu cheese, plenty of avocado, bacon, diced egg and tomatoes topped off with bleu cheese dressing. And the black tie chicken pasta 4/5. The pasta is one of my favorites and is served with blackened chicken, bow tie pasta, spinach tortelloni stuffed with cheese and diced tomato all tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce yum yum! Very filling but good to the last bow tie pasta!

They also brought out some toasted cheese topped bread, which accompanied the meal well. 

We thought we were ready to ask for the check then realized...we couldn't possibly leave without splitting a slice of carrot cake! The carrot cake was huge and topped with crunchy shreds of carrot which gave it a nice texture 5/5. This is why we keep coming back for more! Additionally, for your birthday they bring you out either a red velvet cupcake or a small cake and ice cream topped with sprinkles.

Of all the meats I tried, the ribs were definitely the highlight.  I don't know why I ever order chicken in restaurants; it's always dry and tastes the same anyhow.

My son's pizza...the greasiest oil infested rounded plain dough slapped together like he made it himself. Didn't even eat half of it

I like their pies and their potato cheesecakes. I would much rather get appetizers and dessert here always. And even then, can I accept to pay these prices for this?"}

She mentioned that they serve large portions so we decided to split the Ore Cart. The bread they bring out was sooo good, but it stuck to my teeth a lot. Their chicken and tri tip was really good. The chicken was like almost a whole chicken which was pretty cool and definitely lives up to the large portion remark (the price matches the portions though, $30 for the ore cart). We had tried to get a side of veggies but they were super limited in their options which is why they lost a star. No broccoli?? That is a crime. And no green beans or zucchini. So we got mashed potatoes with country gravy and mac n cheese. The mashed potatoes were really good but the mac n cheese was very plain. The sauce didn't stick to the noodles well (too watery?) and I ended up eating dry noodles most of the time.  Definitely a good place to check out if you love meat!"}

Ok Ohajah, straight to the point. I am not a fan. Reason being, my chicken came out tasting like rubber and my entire meal came out luke warm, which leads me to believe, my meal which was the spicy chicken was precooked and preheated ‍ so not enjoyable! Ok so I try my partners who purchased the Thai chicken, same thing rubber every-other piece.  Siggghhhh moving on to the onion soup that came with the meal, onion what onion, flavor, where? Just tasteless.. the spicy California Roll, not a fan either. The entire Roll once again taste like it was premade, nothing fresh about it within the Roll. Now the plus side of Ohajah, my garlic edamame was perfect!!!! Warm, tons of flavor fresh!!! I would come to this location everyday for the garlic edamame it's pure perfection.
The atmosphere is beautiful as well, the private dinning area is a neat addition to the large grills they have, this location also has a full bar with a area just for sushi , the prices are great and the   Meal size very large, I would share with two people. Well never the less, I am not a fan but I would come back for a drink from the bar and Edamame! During the lunch hour at a discounted rate."}

The table servers/hosts make us feel rushed sometimes while we decide on what we want, or after our food has been cooked, but while Jason is entertaining us with his awesome skills and great personality we never feel like he's on autopilot like some other chefs are. That's why we make sure to request him every visit. Another great thing about him is how he interacts with the kids. My son falls for the ketchup trick every time.

When I lived in CA, I frequented CJ quite a bit and never had a disappointing meal.  I think I'm secretly in love with the chocolate mother lode cake and disguise it by saying how much I enjoy the restaurant and think their food is great, yada, yada, yada.  

I was happy to see this location in NV and decided to get my favorite salad, the California Citrus Salad, to go.  It's a great combination of greens, avocados, mandarin oranges, green onions, golden raisins, cranberries and candied walnuts.  Soooooooooo good!  

While waiting for our orders, my co-worker and I decided to get a brownie to split.  It was big, of course, so it was like having one whole "normal" brownie.  Sad to say, this was the first disappointing thing I've had.  It wasn't as moist inside as I expected, not as chewy on the outside as I would have liked, and I now realize I don't care for nuts with my brownies.   Oh well.  It was chocolate, so there was no way I wasn't going to finish it.

I would definitely recommend Ohjah to anyone and we will be returning anytime a craving for teppan hits!"}

The restaurant is the nicest CJ I've ever seen. We went in the afternoon on a Saturday around 4 pm and it wasn't busy at all and quiet. Our server Edward was very polite and attentive. We ordered the spinach dip for an appetizer which tasted great. Our main entrees, the Tri Tip Dip and country fried steak were also great and the temps were just right, not too hot or cold. For our first outing here, I don't think it could have gotten any better unless the food was free. Two thumbs up CJ, you did it right."}

I highly recommend the tri-tip sliders, street tacos and pretzels! All very good and all cheap to. 

The service at the bar is solid to. I started to joke with the bartender that CJ was becoming my go to hang out place to grab a drink and food after work because the specials are just that good. Needless to say, that is not the first time she heard that. Overall, CJ is a solid place as far as the bar goes and there happy hour menu just takes it up that extra notch."}

OK, good enough.  Gabriel introduced himself and ask if we had been here before and did we have our rewards card.  Yes, to both.  They guys got a pitcher of beer and me an iced tea.  I love it when they bring a carafe so you can fill your own refills.
He brought a hot loaf of bread but we had to ask for some butter.  Our large order of crispy parm zuchinni rings arrived quickly and we devoured all but 2.  2 of both ordered the clam chowder instead of a salad, but we had to ask twice for some hot sauce to spice it up a little.  Entrees took a while but the wait was ok while the app and soup settled.  Ignacio had the after the gold rush chicken marsala and enjoyed it but was unable to finish it.  Uriel had the calzon but it was missing the pepperoni and sausage he requested and only had cheese in it.  He returned it and nibbled from both of our plates, which was ok.  The manager came over and offered a free mile high chocolate cake for the mistake.
I had the 7 oz steak and fried shrimp.  Steak was cooked perfect.  Shrimp were kind of soggy and cold.  I ate about half the large baked potato.

We walked in to be greeted immediately by several of the staff.  We were there during happy hour times so we wandered into the bar/saloon area.   This is definitely a large bar area with booths, tables and outdoor seating as well as plenty of seats at the bar.  Only a few tv's in there so place yourself accordingly if you want to watch a game. 

Our waiter, William, was over in seconds to greet us.  He provided exemplary service the entire time.  Definitely knowledgeable of the menu with great suggestions.  I'll make sure to ask for his section next time! Thank you William!

We opted to split some pretzel sticks w/cheese.  Only $2 on the Happy Hour menu.  Love it!  But we can't just stop there.  We also split the Widow Maker Burger.  Phenomenal!  They cooked it perfectly as requested.  This sandwich is piled high with smoked bacon, onion rings, avocado, cheddar and tomato.  The burger was juicy and delicious. I would definitely get this again.

They have pretty good HH Menu options.  With happy hour times everyday and ALL day on Sunday, it's really convenient.  I would love to stop back in again soon!"}

I ordered the Drunk Chicken (what a name) and it was actually better than I had expected. The chicken was extremely tender and still maintained its moisture, despite the fact that it's grilled chicken breast. The Bacon-Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce tasted mainly of bacon and was a bit too oily, but yummy nonetheless. Who doesn't love bacon? "Potatocakes" aka croquettes were nice and creamy...

The desserts are flavorly and probably large enough to feed three people. My favorite dish here is the Pot Pie. The vegetables mixed with that creamy sauce is like no other. Combine it with that tasty, toasty crust and WOW what a great comfort food.

Service was average at best, but that's ok because the food more then made up for it. If I recall right our drinks never ran flat and we stayed topped off. I have eaten at many Claim Jumpers and this one can hang with the best of them."}

Jason the hibachi chef is THE BEST! He's the reason I'll give this place 5 stars. The only complaint I have is sometimes our hibachi chef (differs almost every time now we call ahead to make sure Jason is available) is in a little bit of a bad mood which puts a damper on the meal but other than that, great place."}

Recently, on 1/29/18 we tried the Ohjah Pecos in Henderson. It was below average in everything except the server. The guy cooking, plated both the fried rice and noodles on everyone's plate. We ordered individually because we all have a preference to what starch we like. Then the entrees we ordered we partially served to the other people sitting at the teppan table. Our party had 4 adults, 1 teen, and 1 baby (2 yrs old), but we always order more food. We ordered 6 entrees: 3 chicken, 1 steak, 1 lobster and 1 shrimp for all to share. Instead the guy cooking shared our three chicken with the other two parties at our table. We usually have left overs to take home, but this time we felt less than full when we left. Very disappointing, never experienced this at Ohjah Decautur. We'll never go back to Ohjah Pecos. ;("}

Big portions are good if the flavor is just as big, but this isn't the case for (this) Claim Jumper. 

Appetizer platter was large and had a good variety. The baked potato entree was bland; the veggies were okay. Alfredo sauce didn't do anything for me. We also ordered chicken fried steak. It was two huge pieces, about 5" or more in diameter, and from my sample, tasted pretty good. A lot better than my baked potato, that's for sure.

Desserts menu is decent sized, and even their "mini" desserts are enough for two people to share. The mini I-Declair was good, but not the greatest and I wouldn't order it again.

The only good thing about this place was the service. It was huge, no wait (due to there being lots of open tables on a Saturday night), and quick service. We didn't have to wait too long for our appetizer or food. Our waiter was entertaining and funny and should probably quit this job and be a waiter somewhere else."}

After reading a few reviews prior, we were hoping to get Jason as our hibachi chef and sure enough we did. He was definitely brag worthy!! 
We came on a Saturday night with a 7:30 pm reservation, and waited about 10 minutes. We were seated along with another party, and Jason introduced himself while doing a few things with his knives that will definitely catch your eye and as he put it, "wake up!!". I'd rather much not tell about the entire experience with him because I really think it's worth seeing it for yourself! Overall he was a nice man with funny comments and definitely kept us smiling and laughing. 
For the both of us, it came out to about $40 but that's also with my appetizer of teriyaki chicken on the side.
We were so stuffed! We chose the hibachi teppanyaki that came with onion soup, side salad with their own style dressing, and fried rice. With $6-7 more for the protein choice, (we had chicken). 
It's definitely worth checking this place out. Highly recommended, and worth every cent. Fresh, and a nice experience. Perfect for a date night too!"}

I can't say I enjoyed my food but, my boyfriend enjoyed his meal a lot. He liked the steak that he ordered and said it was the best he ever had. I had a piece and can attest that it was very nicely marinated. My food; however, was salty to the point where I couldn't eat it. The BBQ shrimp were good but, I was hoping for something lighter on the salt after that appetizer and did not get that in the entree. They tried very hard to accommodate my tastes and brought a salad without anything salty which I enjoyed. Maybe next time they won't put as much salt. I would come back based on service.

I haven't been to a Claim Jumper in a couple of years.  I don't know why I stopped.  Maybe because I thought the food was just okay.  

Upon my husband's insistence, we took my mother in law for dinner here since she has never been to one.  She absolutely loves The Cheesecake Factory so this was new to her. 

Our server was really attentive.  The bread was good and the water was plentiful but pretty much ended at that unless you count the cake we took home which was okay.  

I don't mind paying good $$$ for a good meal.  I work in the food industry. I have shelled out some decent money at The French Laundry.   But at least have some decency to have some ounce of truth in your advertising.  Or at least attempt to make the dishes you advertise look as advertised.  The salmon oscar was $29.99.  I asked for it to be medium rare and what came out was a 4-5 oz fish portion with a smattering of crab.  What a sad dish.  

I have become more vocal of not accepting half the dish I ordered since I am certainly paying full price for it.  So I told the server my disappointment.  She sent the manager and he came over to ask if I would like anything else.  Mind you my companions are halfway through their meals already.  So I ordered the shrimp fresca.  I should have known from the previous event that it will absolutely NOT look like the picture but I took a chance.  Disappointment once again seized the chance to show me he was king!  

You would think that the server would realize that I was disappointed in my dish since I refused to take the rest of it home.   But I guess we no longer train our service employees to read disappointment in the faces of our guests.  

It will probably be another couple of years before I would ever go back to a Claim Jumper.  Probably NEVER.  I should have been more insistent on The Cheesecake Factory."}

This time did not reflect our past visits here, waiter was super busy and service was not as great as it could have been. 
After placing my order and waiting 35 minutes out comes my burger it was not as I had requested.
Tried to flag waiter down for ten solid minutes before he came over.
I explained what was wrong and he said sorry it was his fault and he would order a new burger.
This burger came out in five minutes and dropped in front of me. After requesting that a different waiter send over the manager, my waiter came by to ask about my burger.
The Manager was nice and she did remove the burger off my check but nothing else. After two hours, I had two drinks and some chips no dinner... Sucks"}

About the service. Our waitress was just "there". By that I mean she never paid attention to what we wanted. I asked for water with no lemon, I got water with lemon. I asked for white rice, I got fried rice.

Don't pass up the rotisserie chicken, either. It's succulent and flavorful."}

We enjoyed the ambiance. It was a big dining space but at least half full. The service was also good. But the food was just OK. We ordered a white sangria, pretty tasty and very little alcohol -- just the way we like it. We also got a side salad that was fine, but not memorable. The shrimp fresca pasta was extremely buttery but not very salty, and the shrimp were overbreaded. The tenderloin tips were also OK with the beef being a bit chewy. We would probably go to Cheesecake Factory next time we're in the mood for big portions of classic American fare."}

While not the most traditional and a more franchise generic type of establishment, you will find your hankering for steak, chicken, seafood and alcoholic drinks well taken care of here. 

The ambiance is very nice, there is a small sushi bar and plenty of teppanyaki tables. If you are entertaining, or just gathered with friends this is a great place. 

Service is very good here. 

In terms of a real authentic Japanese meal, well don't choose this place for that reason. I would put this place on par with those Brazilian steakhouses in terms of a style more than an authentic experience. This is like having your meat grilled with salt pepper and soy sauce or teriyaki sauce.

I have eaten here several times and also tried their new branch that just opened near Summerlin.   They do give the same service and the same quality and quantity of food.   THis is so important to keep these two together.  Staff is always friendly as well.

Me and the lady took my son out for late lunch. I was happy to see that a vegetarian section was on the menu. Very many vegan choices but was happy anyways for the effort. The place is still decorated with that country and snow Lodge feel. The people are nice and our server was nice. Probably could have been a little more friendly but they were nice. I ordered the lemon pepper fried zucchini sticks and a side of fries. My wifey ordered the pork sliders with fries. My son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. While we were waiting they got our drinks and delivered a cheesy bread which I couldn't have but both my son and wife said it was really good. I didn't see much of my server but my drinks stayed filled and the manager walk by one time and said hi. Now let's get to the food. Portion size is still large which is a plus. Like I've said before leftovers are always great. Each meal looks very appetizing and the food was tasty. My wife and son both agreed and the atmosphere was nice as well we sat outside in the patio. good job Claim Jumper! Keep it up it seems to be working! If I could add anything it would be more vegan options. Now I don't want to take away from this place as it is a meat-and-potatoes kind of establishment. But maybe a couple vegan options wouldn't be bad. Thanks again for a good time!"}

Now Open!" hanging out in front was calling my name. Cool, we have the popular Vegas sushi/ teppanyaki style steakhouse now here in Henderson.

Really nice, classy, contemporary, yet casual vibe. The staff greeting, will ask you where you prefer to sit. Hibachi area, sushi bar, or dining room.

Hibachi 411
So we chose to dine in this area. It takes up 40% of the place. There are 5 hibachi grills. Each seats 10 people. Busy late afternoon (the linner hour) had 3 grills with 3 chefs already. 

-Menu-
Requirement when you are sitting at these tables each person order the basic entree.
It includes vegetables, house salad, onion soup, and your choice fried noodle or rice (steamed, fried, or brown) $8.95

Then you can choose your proteins: steak, chicken, seafood ..serving sizes are written next to each selection. Prices range for each selection $6.95 up to $48.95 for the Kobe Beef. So your average $ per person here if they order entree and 2 meats approx $26 per person.

The sushi and dinner menu is also available sitting here, but we opted just to have appetizers.

Our party had steak, chicken and fried rice.  Everything was good. Fresh, quality cut beef. Seasoned just right. Nothing salty at all. House salad had a nice ginger dressing.  

The chef that worked our table was entertaining, skilled and engaged with each one of us. But I was his favorite, so I got more veggies and rice than anyone else..ha ha.

Service was awesome by everyone in here. Overall, really nice dining experience. We all want to come back and check out dining in the tatami rooms next.

Note: Not open for lunch ...They start dinner hour at 3pm.

Location 
Pecos/Windmill in the builidng where Pumi used to be. Those who know the place,..it's totally different...Ohjah did a great job remodeling this space. A bunch of diners were already repeat customers from their Vegas location and was so happy about this place They like it more because it's bigger and much fancier. Im happy that Ohjah is now part of our neighborhood too!"}

He did talk with us but only said how important his customers were. So I the food. Every egg he broke had egg shell in it and he mixed it into the fried rice. Then he kept adding oil, oil, and more oil. No season at all. The rice was brown but only from over cooking it and burning all the oil in it. When I took a bite it tasted of oil and I was so pleased to get some broken egg shell. I set the bowl right back in the grill and said something to the cook. I got no answer. On to the shrimp. I got 5 pieces of shrimp in my meal.?and it was loaded down with oil. Thank good ness for the sauce on the side. It took away some of the oil taste. Buy wait, I didn't get any vegetables when the other did. When I said something he asked for some vegetables from the back. Again drilling with oil and even after I asked him not to use so much. So my 5 pieces of shrimp cost me $19.00. Almost $4 a shrimp. Expensive dinner. I didn't eat the rice or vegetables. Not one person in that resteraunt asked about the meal or why I left the food there.  I don't recommend this place anymore. And if you get the chef with the orange camo hat run for the hills."}

I thought the veggies were fresh, the salads were fresh, and the dressings were really good.  The chicken pot pie is one of my faves at this joint, this time as with others, it was good..  The mother lode cake,, huge chocolate cake with 7 layers.  It takes me several sittings to finish it...  They have a fresh bakery onsite that bakes their breads and rolls you know its fresh.  I have tried the ore cart, and the ribs... Both selections are really good and big portioins...  In my opinion, this plays gets it right... They serve good tasting food, the portions are way big, service is good and the prices are reasonable for what you get...  I whole heartedly recommend this location to yelpers.... I like this place and i hope you all do as well... Hope this yelps"}

Looking confused, the hostess then asked us what we are here for sushi or hibachi. 
There was only two of us and three hibachi stations with about 10 seats for each. The lady then placed us at some seats off to the side of the hibachi table where this was our first time, we wanted the full experience and she said "is this ok?" And we said is it ok if we sit in the front and she said "no we can't because we have a large party of 7 people and they need to sit together". So other than us not be accommodated, the prices were really reasonable. $5 for a glass of wine that was shockingly really really good. We walked out of there each paying $25 and getting wine, a full meal and dessert.

For the meal you can choose between fried rice or noodles and you get a side salad and soup and then you pick your entree (shrimp, beef, Kobe beef, chicken) and get a side of vegetables too. 

I had the mango cheesecake that was really good but tiny."}

But I went ahead & ordered my favorite thing on the menu...the Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich.  When it arrived, it was HALF the size it normally is.  I soon discovered why!  The wonderful slaw/lettuce mix they had always used & added so much to the sandwich, was now changed to crappy & plain ole lettuce.  I was NOT happy in the least.

Fast forward to lunch today when I took my other half of the sandwich for left overs.  Imagine my shock when I bit down on a chicken BONE!!!  It freakin broke my molar tooth.  Then I found 2 more hard white bone grisle pieces that had been mixed into the Chicken Salad Mixture.  I just sent the Corporate office a nasty gram via email.  I had BETTER hear back from someone.

I do have to say, the waiter (cant remember his name) was really great & explained that corporate just made all these changes to bring Claim Jumper out of the 1980's.  Apparently, Claim Jumper was just purchased by some other corporation & decided to change things.  I will NOT return to the Green Valley Parkway location ever again.  I normally go to the Summerlin location.  I may never return at all.  It is such a shame because Claim Jumper has always been one of my favorite places to eat.

I do have to say, the new onion rings were delicious.  I guess they had been previously frozen like the fried zucchini.  Now they are hand battered & made fresh.  That was the only good change corporate has made.

If it wasn't broke, why fix it???"}

Primarily because it just never struck me as something special and it really isn't. I always remember the food as being just a shrug. Nothing bad, but nothing great either. However, I have been visiting their restaurants lately per request of family and these recent experiences have changed my view of this brand and their food.

The last time I dined here, I decided to take a different route and go with a steak. I ordered their Ribeye Steak: hand-cut, boneless USDA Choice, 12oz  ($24.29) with Salt & Pepper Shoestring Fries. To my surprise, the meat was delicious. Tender, grilled perfectly to medium rare, and most importantly, tasty. I was floored. I have spent more money on less steak to have it cooked improperly! I was ecstatic. The fries were unbelievably salty though. It was okay though because I was just so happy about my steak. I also tried some of my fiance's Chicken Pot Pie ($13.29) and I couldn't believe it was better than the one I had at Grand Lux Cafe in September!

We also visited this past Thanksgiving with my fiance's parents. I selected the roasted turkey with gravy, stuffing, cranberry relish, baked potato with butter and chives, and roasted vegetables. Again, delicious! The turkey was surprisingly moist, gravy was tasty, the stuffing was also moist, the relish was sweet and added texture to compliment everything else really well, and the carrots, zucchini, red onions, and yellow squash were roasted perfectly! It was truly a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and very, very filling. The apple pie and pumpkin pie offered with the dinner were just okay. Oh, we were also served gigantic dinner rolls were so delicious.

Although Claim Jumper won't be one of my first choices for dining out, I can say that I am truly pleased with the food and wouldn't mind returning. I had a hard time deciding on 3 or 4 stars since the food has definitely been a four-star experience, however, the service and over dining experience would warrant three stars (our server couldn't remember anything - our orders, that there was a child in our party, if we paid our bill, etc - it was odd)."}

We did the hibachi dinner (of course), although I do want to go back in the future specifically for the sushi boat as that looked awesome. 

It was a really short wait from when we ordered to when the chef started cooking and the wait felt even shorter as after ordering they almost immediately brought out the salad and onion soup (yum). The entertainment factor was fun and it was interesting to actually get to watch everything get cooked.

The actual grilling takes place in 3 stages: the rice/noodles (FYI that brown rice is brought out to you by a waiter and not from the hibachi grill in front of you), vegetables, and finally meat & seafood. I like to eat my food groups mainly separately anyway so this worked out well for me as I could start on the items as they came off the grill, but if you're a big "combined plate" person, waiting through 3 stages for your complete plate might seem to be a little much. 

I decided on the shrimp and brown rice and also got to try the sole. The shrimp came off the grill with great flavor and cooked perfectly. The sole was flakey and delicious and was a fairly large piece of fish. I am looking forward to trying the fried rice and the scallops in the future as those looked amazing coming off the grill and the scallops were huge. 

One of the best things about this hibachi grill though is the pricing. I wanted to price compare so I looked at the Benihana menu on the strip (the next closest hibachi grill) and the prices there were $10-15 dollars more per plate than Ohjah. Dinner at Ohjah was a really fair price and I'm excited to bring more friends and family in the future."}

I'm not a person who returns stuff, because I don't want my food messed with, so I just ate it without complaint. My bf ordered the chicken fried steak and it was HUGE. He is a big eater, but he couldn't even finish that. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, a burger and meatloaf. One thing to mention is they are no longer selling garlic bread. Instead, they bring a medium size roll with a marinara sauce brushed on top. It was ok, but nothing special. 

I ordered the motherlode cake for dessert for all of us to share and that was amazing. Super chocolatey, decadent and rich. Yum. I would come back to this Claim Jumper, but I would order something different."}

( not my decision )  This place still "SUCKS" and always will in now, both our books!!!  Thank god!!! Now, she finally See's what i was talking about this whole time. OK, she had the Roasted tri-tip and I had the country fried steak. OMG.......GROSS!!!!!   what a lump of sh**.  I'll post a pic of what I scrapped off it. ( Pic. is next to my profile pic. ) To start the waiter was da da duh....we asked for ( No lemon ) in our water and yep...you guessed it lemon. He said: i couldn't remember if you wanted lemon or not so i put it on there for you. I said: we told you 30 seconds ago, glad we are not allergic to it!!  First nose dive...Appetizer was good had the roasted artichoke ( bout the only thing they know how to make ).  Then the dreaded  so-called food came.  Waiter forgot her bread that comes with it, and no gravy poured on the tri-tip.  Mine looked like it came from a cow patty field in Jasper Oklahoma!!!  I really didn't want to even eat it.  I think a two year old could have done a better job at making it rather than them.  What makes me wonder is how this place stays in business!  No disrespect to other people but, I think they don't know what "GOOD FOOD IS".  If I was the health department I would shut this place down in a heartbeat for awful tasting wanna be food.    Overall rating:  - F -F -F -F -F   five minus F's!!!!!!   ( i wish they had a food sucks rating )  To sum it up...We will NEVER step foot in there ever again!!!!     (   THANK GOD!!!!  )"}

They said the wait time was 25 minutes at 6:45pm on a Friday. About 16 customers were waiting to be seated in the waiting area, and a few more in the bar area. It took about 25 minutes to be seated...but we counted at least 9 unoccupied tables and 40 unoccupied seats in the area we were seated. I Ordered the Steak Chili Baker.  Bread was hot.  The Chili inside - STONE COLD.  Like someone opened a can of .89 cents Chili from a shelf and and simply spooned it in.  The menu indicated it would be topped with "Cheddar Cheese", 3 small shreds of cheese. I tried 2 spoonfuls, the meal (if that's what Claim Jumper calls a meal), was sent back 98% untouched. When I told the server  it was cold, she simply said she would have it "heated up". This response is what made me furious. Manager came buy a few moments later with a most insincere apology and his only response was an attempt to sell me something else. The sales receipt shows "Kitchen Error, COLD" on it where they backed out the cost.  Cold either means not cooked, or cooked and then left out until room temperature. Either way, this is a health hazard.  I will be notifying Southern Nevada Health District.

UPDATE 3/15/2012
Both the Assistant Manager and the Manager called me (I submitted a complaint on the Claim Jumper Website) to offer their apologies and express how they will better coach their staff."}

First time we ate sushi, and while the pricing was very reasonable, the quality of the fish was only average.  The second time we ate at the hibachi grill. Our chef was good but not exceptional in his 'act' while preparing our food.  You could hardly hear his comments as he performed.  More importantly, the hibachi food was uninspired.  The Gyoza were under-cooked. The fried rice was basically rice with egg and a little scallion and lots of minced garlic.  The vegetables were properly cooked but bland, with the primary taste being the onions.  The NY steak was properly cooked, but a mix of chewy and parts that were tender.  The scallops were large, for the most part properly cooked (except for one under-cooked) .
Again, the pricing was extremely reasonable, but food not worth the trip."}

First, I called to make reservations for 6:00 PM.  I called at 1:00 and they put me on hold for 10 minutes.... to make a reservation.

I called back an hour later and made the reservation.  When I showed up, they didn't have it.

They told me we would have to wait for 40 minutes, even though the restaurant was half-empty on a Friday night.  (That's another sign.  Where is the business during Friday dinner).

They seated us early.  Didn't matter.  It took an hour to get the food.  I could hear the manager apologizing to another table next to us, so it must be common.  

Not only that, people who showed up later got their food earlier.  And the food?  Nice and cold.

Boycott this place.  Maybe we can get a better restaurant to replace it."}

Seating in the bar is usually not a problem.  The food deals are a steal.  

Some of my favorite happy hour food items: the small salads, loaded skins, street tacos, calamari, and spinach artichoke dip.  I wish the fries with the gravy sauce was still on there.  

I can't leave Claim Jumper without the butter cake dessert.  Even if I can only fit two bits, I will just take the rest home and have an amazing breakfast.  I keep meaning to try the new salted caramel butter cake, but then I forget when I am there!

Service is acceptable.  My girls and I have had days where we were slightly ignored due to how busy the establishment is.  I get it.  Most times I see it going that way, I make sure to grab the server and get the second drink ordered before I run out of the first one.  

Speaking of drinks, you can never go wrong with a glass of wine.  However, if you are so inclined, the lemon drop martini and raspberry martini are excellent.  I also like their mojito.  

Of course, the full menu is available in the bar area.  Claim Jumper has some solid fish and comfort food entries.

When it was finally our time to sit and eat the waitress thank us for our patience which was nice. We ordered our food and they brought out this garlic cheese loaf that tasted amazing, the last time we were there they had the sun dried tomato one which is also very tasty. We waiting a lot longer than normal for our food but the nice waitress we had thanked us again for our patience and brought us out another loaf of bread to nibble on while we waited for our food. The have a clam chowder soup my husband gets and he says it's the best he has had. My husband got the talipia plate and he enjoyed his food he said it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My chopped steak was disappointing for the first time, it was way over cooked and was a little burnt on the bottom i ate it because i didn't want to have to wait for a new one and also i was appreciative of what they were doing for the vets. I will visit again becasue i think they were just having trouble keeping up due to the volume of people there. When we finished our meal the waitress brought us our bill for my food the drinks and my husbands soup and thanked him for his service which was very nice.

Our soup, salad and appetizers were all delivered at the same time, which made us feel rushed once again.  The hibachi chef came over to our table shortly after and made our food to perfection. (Best part of the experience)
We were barely In the middle of our meal when the server dropped our check without even asking whether or not we would like another drink or dessert. 
I think the worst part of the whole experience was when 5 buss boys & a manager hovered over our table waiting for us to get up. 
I confronted the manager about feeling rushed, he said "we are very busy" I looked around to see Nobody waiting... hummm. This was not a good experience what so ever!"}

I have also lived in Japan for 4 years and know my Japanese food.  

Just to let you know before you read.  This place is not an actual Japanese restaurant, at least when it comes to the regular dining.  They have Japanese dishes, but it more Chinese and Korean if anything. Most of the people I saw working there were Chinese. I did not see a single Japanese person which had me concerned about the food in the beginning.

For starters when we walked and was asked if we would like Hibachi or regular dining.  I said Hibachi, then the waiter left for a quick moment and came back with the manager.  The manager (older Chinese lady) said while walking to us no you can't sit in at the Hibachi table. I felt very disrespected at the tone of her voice. I asked her how long the wait would be she said 40 minutes.  I said regular dining was fine then.  We sat down and the service from then on was fine.

Now on to the food,
We ordered Gyoza and Yakitori chicken for appetizers and my daughter (5yrs old) wanted the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  The Gyoza was deep fried which is fine, but had very little taste.  The Yakitori was 3 pieces of white meat chicken (it didn't specify it was white meat on the menu) on stick x3 and it was slightly dry and and no taste even with the sauce on it.  For a Japanese restaurant to serve white meat Yakitori is hard to find. Typically in Japanese culture it is dark meat chicken.

The Shrimp Tempura Udon
The Shrimp comes on the side which the waitress told us.  The Shrimp Tempura was okay nothing to brag about.  The Udon noodles were overcooked and way too soft.  The Broth was very sweet, not salty or any meat taste for a Japanese broth.  When my I take my daughter to eat she eats all her noodles. She ate 4 bites and said she didn't want anymore. which has never happened. 

I ordered the combination Yakisoba and White Tiger Sushi Roll.
The Yakisoba came out and I saw instantly that the noodles used were chow mien noodles (a medium fat noodles) not actual a noodles used in Japanese Yakisoba (a skinny type noodle).  The Yakisoba was very sweet like the Shrimp Tempura Udon.  I couldn't finish it and asked the waitress to take it away.  They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else I told them no.  The White Tiger Roll was very small.  The roll was about 3/4 an inch High maybe.  I was very disappointed in the size of the rolls.  The fish was not fresh and they used a lot of spice to try and cover it up.

Overall I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I had to return part of my meal because the only thing Japanese about the dining area was the names on the menu.  Some things are priced too high for what they are, and the food was not good at all. The best thing I had, was the water."}

They have boca burgers to sub any beef patty, which is nice. My fiancé and I both went with burgers that night and they were awesome. And the fries?

He wasn't even talking much. Especially with a table with 3 different families with children. The main concern here and reason I'm writing this is because he forgot our son's shrimp that we ordered. He still had the grill on cooking vegetables and he couldn't even bother to get some more fresh shrimp to cook up for him but instead he cut up the few pieces of shrimp he set aside on the grill to save for after so that he can toss it into people's mouths. He served those 4 pieces of shrimp to my 4 yr old son he forgot to serve, after it's been sitting on the grill. He did not even apologize and the manager seemed like he could care less. They did take off our son's meal off our bill but that is not the point. He could've handled that better. He managed to serve 11 other people and couldn't even serve our son after realizing HIS mistake. We are regulars at the flamingo location and never had a bad experience until now. This location has very bad customer service."}

My party of 2 wanted to dine al fresco, so we headed to the patio and were told a table was opening up. As we went to the table, another server told us that someone will get to you eventually, or something to that effect. It was packed on the patio, and we saw that the servers were rushing around. 

O and MG, no one stopped by our table for about 20 minutes, so we gave up and went to sit at the bar. Things did improve after that, luckily! We got our drinks pretty quick and were finally able to order. We had 2 appetizers- the spinach/artichoke dip and breaded lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was delicious, and the dip not so much. It was not hot and needed more flavor. My meal of simply grilled mahi was pretty good, although the sauce could've been tastier.
My dining partner really enjoyed the steak and shrimp entree. Our server/bartender was pretty good about checking on us and did mention something like they didn't expect such a crowd that night, which didn't make sense to me. I learned my lesson about trying to dine on the patio, for sure!"}

I had to sit at the hibachi table.  Amazing food and show for great price.  Our Chef Jason kept us laughing.  He is quite the showman.  Best onion volcano!  He was engaging and required crowd participation.

Fried rice was yummy.  Steak cooked well.  Sister's calamari was so tender.

We usually avoid appetizers because we always leave so full and that was definitely the case here that night. Our entrees came with choice of soup or salad. I chose chicken tortilla and the babe had clam chowder. The winner was the chowder. Very good. Mine was good too but not equally delicious. The babe had beef ribs and I had beef tips with mushrooms atop mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Can't remember the name of the dish. The beef ribs were huge. They could have been more tender but we really enjoyed them. I wasn't a fan of my dish too much because it had so much Rosemary in the sauce but the beef was very tender and the veggies were really good. The service was great and I liked the log cabin decor inside. Made it very cozy. I would definitely come back when in the mood for comfort food the ambiance is nice and the service even better.

They just comped our whole anniversary dinner (like $81 bucks) because we had a couple of issues. Tasha ordered a Hawaii Tai and it had a piece of Glass (we think it came from the rum bottle so they told us) in it (she did not cut herself). Then we thought ok free drinks, discount on food maybe? We weren't mad, we just didn't want anything else with ice in it. So they brought out this bomb red wine with a slightly obscene French name (menage a something) 

Then when Tasha's Surf and Turf came out my mashed potatoes were ice cold because Tasha's meal took longer to cook. They apologized profusely, brought me new sides, a red velvet happy anniversary cupcakes, and a huge slice of six layer chocolate cake and extra garlic Texas cheese toast comped the whole meal gave Happy Anniversary wishes and begged us to come back again so they can make things perfect. Best service & recovery I have experienced in years (like 7). I was not expecting all of that! 

All and all when they fixed our issues the food was amazing and the service and the recovery more than made up for our two, "Uhhh what's this?" moments. I will be back again. Thanks guys for making our 9 year anniversary memorable in an awesome way because this could have played out very, very differently. Not the perfect experience, but the absolute perfect effort."}

My father in law is a big fan of hibachi style restaurants so we thought we'd give this a shot instead of Benihana.

First off, the prices are reasonable and the way that the menu is set up allows everyone, regardless of your budget, the opportunity to partake in Hibachi. We each ordered the typical hibachi (soup, salad, vegetables, rice) with 2 meats for about $25. It is plenty of food too.

The food was delicious! I ordered the salmon and shrimp and could not have been happier. Dad ordered the chicken and steak and he was pleased too. We also got an order of the dragon roll and the volcano roll. I HIGHLY recommend the dragon roll. But both were fantastic.

For those that love hibachi, the show can sometimes get boring. It's the same onion volcano and egg roll every time. But not here. Our chef was HILARIOUS and tried out a lot of new stuff that kept us on our toes. We did sake shots as a table and it was a good time. Seriously, the best chef I've seen.

I felt that we were forgotten about, when I finally received my Burger it had paper in it, apparently they did not take the paper off the cheese and I ate part of it.  The server told me it was ok because it was just paper, she grabbed a manager who told me the same thing.  I argued that it was not ok, no one should eat paper!  

The manager told me she would replace it with soup or a salad, I told her forget it I was only on lunch and I would stop somewhere on the way back to work to get a burger at a fast food place, my friend said "no they can just make you another one"  and the manager just looked at us....she was not prepared I guess to give us another burger?!  Weird.....she disappeared for about 15 minutes, but we could see her walking around in the bar area, when she came back out she actually lied and said she cooked it herself....kind of difficult to make a burger in the kitchen when you are in the bar!"}

First of all, 5 stars for location. Love having a cool place in walking distance.
Second, I really like what they've done with the décor - it's definitely upgraded from the old Pumi days, with a smaller sushi bar in back, and a larger "bar" bar in front.
Third, the food. There are the Sohos and the Yonakas and the Yojies of the Southwestern Vegas world, but we didn't really have any inventive Japanese places in the Southeast...until now! We had tuna carpaccio (yum), suzukiana (or something - halibut....super yum), Bluefin tuna (awesome), a raw beef dish (medium good...but at least it was really huge), and the screaming o (typically not my style, but I ordered with the sauce on the side and just dipped it and it was really good). Oh yeah and the salmon nachos (good. Served on a pringle!). Food was excellent.
Prices are reasonable. For all that, plus edamame and a bottle of really good sake, it was about $120. Hibachi meals start around $18 I think.
Overall, we'll definitely be back, with the kids."}

Initially, we had planned to go to another sushi restaurant but read the reviews for this place. 
First impression of the place was really nice. The restaurant is split into two sections: the hibachi tables and booths on the side. They also have a bar up front as well. 
The menu offered a great deal of options. However if you want hibachi, you have to sit at the hibachi tables. 
My brother and I ended up going with the Ohjah Boat, which includes your choice of 3 special rolls, 12 pieces of sashimi, and 10 pieces of nigiri. The sashimi and the nigiri are chef's choice. I was initially sad that I couldn't pick certain nigiri; however, the presentation and quality of the fish really pushed my rating to 5 stars. The fish pieces were fatty and well portioned when it came to the rice to fish ratio. Also the sushi rolls were great (my brother and I chose the Black Widow, Tsunami, and volcano roll). My personal favorite was the Black Widow. Besides the boat, we also got 2 orders of eel nigiri and a salmon Kama. All of which were cooked perfectly and delicious. The service was also excellent. Our server frequently checked up on us and gave us suggestions when we had difficulty choosing options. 
I would definitely recommend coming to this place. It's decently priced for a place that does a la carte. Will definitely come back but to try the hibachi next time!"}

Service: They do an excellent job as far as service. Everyone is friendly, professional, and move quickly. They defiantly know how to deal with volume since they are a fairly large restaurant.

Food: I like the kids menu for my boys. They have a good selection along with sides and desserts. Plus the portion is big enough for an adult.

It was too far from home for a regular dinner outting.  Then I moved to Las Vegas and just sort of forgot about them.  Just the other night, though, my family visiting from California recommended we go.  

It was a bit different than I remember.  The food is still, for the most part, enormous.  It is what they are known for.  My step mom ordered fried chicken.  It looked my like a turkey filling up the plate the way it did.  The only food of disappointing size on this occassion was the dinner salad we all ordered.  It was a bit skimpy and sort of soggy even though we all ordered different dressing.  I don't remember the bread with tomato dipping sauce being brought to the table before.  It was alright but sort of forgettable.  It was fluffy which was nice.  But the sauce on top and the sauce on the side were bland.  I had a piece with and a piece without the sauce and could hardly tell the difference.  I'll pass.  There were also some items I don't remember seeing on the menu previously.  And even a few I remember that I did not see anymore.  There was no salad bar and we were told it is because we are in Las Vegas and they cannot compete with the casino buffets when it comes to salad bars.  Interesting.

Service the other night was not bad.  Though it is worth noting my grandma ordered fish and chips with no chips but rather a side of fruit instead.  When her meal came, it had fries and no fruit.  We had to ask again for that.  My aunt had to ask for the sweet potato she ordered because it was not brought out either.  Everything else seemed to go off without a hitch.  

I had a Widow Maker burger that was crazy good.  It was cooked to a perfect medium the way I like it.  It was topped with onion rings, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato and some sort of relish.  It was difficult to eat because of its size.  But it was also delicious.  I was impressed with that.  What I was disappointed in with my overall meal was my iced tea.  It was weak.  It was more like water with food coloring.  The lemon helped to give at least some contrast to an otherwise tasteless beverage.

I think I have pretty much fallen out of love with Claim Jumper.  It might as well be just another page in my high school year book that I look back on with fond memories.  I am moving on."}

I ate here for the first time yesterday night (1/10/17) and I was super excited. I had garlic edamame, cucumber and avocado rolls, and an order of the spicy chicken. This is the LAST time I will ever eat here, as I have been violently throwing up all night/morning long since I got back home. My best bet is that the spicy chicken was not thoroughly cooked. I shared the dish with my boyfriend and he also got sick as well. Beware eating any chicken products here, or anything that requires cooking of any kind. I have never been so sick from something that came from a semi-upscale restaurant before. Never coming here again."}

Maybe that was the wrong idea...I am mainly giving it a 1 star due to the not-so-good service and the expense of the meal not being worth what we received. First off, we made reservations, and glad we did. We walked in and it the waiting area was about 15 people. We walked up, got brought right to our table. I'd have to imagine a lot of people made reservations, as there were a lot of empty seats.
We sat down, my friend got the house merlot ($7) and I got a domestic beer ($5.25). We ordered the zucchini sticks. VERY good! a light breading, and ranch dressing. I would recommend these. You get a huge pile of them, so best if there are 3 of you to share since it is an appetizer. They also brought out a big loaf of warm cheddar bread.
When salads came, we did not get any cracked pepper. The people behind us did get fresh cracked pepper. 
My friend got the blackened bow tie chicken, I got the rack of baby back ribs. The blackened chicken was good, but not fantastic. You can get better pasta at a cheaper price at Pasta Cucina inside Sunset Station Casino. 
As for my baby back ribs... I only got 7 bones. There are 13 ribs in pork, granted a couple of ribs may get left off on the shoulder. Basically you are NOT getting a rack. You are getting a half a rack, cut into two sections. I would guess they are taking a section of 3 or 4 that should have been on my plate, and putting it on someone's plate that ordered a half rack. And my "supposed rack" was $25.99!!! I was told gravy came with my mashed potatoes, it didn't. by the time it came, the mashed potatoes were cold.
Now maybe this was a mistake. If it was, the manager can contact me here. I doubt that will happen as I am sure they give everyone a half rack when they order a rack. 
Bottom line, we paid about $75 for a dinner that we felt cheated on and that the service left much to be desired. For that price you can go to Carve steakhouse inside Eastside Cannery and get great service, both get the Rib eye or prime rib (both are fantastic) and get out cheaper. But no drinks (hey, you are in a casino, gamble and drink for free). 
Just too many good places to eat in vegas and not walk away feeling like you were cheated."}

No wait. There were a lot more cars in the parking lot, so it looked like it was crowded (it filled up later on as the night progressed). In our party was my father-in-law, his wife, my husband's Grandma and her husband (came from Pahrump), and my husband and me (three generations).

Our server told us that there were a few changes made to the menu, since Landry's bought the chain out several months ago (which applied to two dinner entrees in our party- more detail later).

Our starter was two orders of the Calamari (thick cuts of calamari, not small rings), served with Asian Slaw (love this!), and cocktail sauce. We were waiting for the marinara sauce, too, but the cocktail sauce worked. The calamari was not the usual type, and was delicious (I want to order this next time!). 

I was having a hard time deciding between three entrees (I've had many dishes and appetizers here; really miss the jambalaya), but I settled on the stuffed baked potato with veggies (carrots, zucchini, squash)- chicken- I chose blackened. Mine was huge! I knew that I would not finish this. My husband had his favorite dish here, meatloaf, which was not the same (smaller, he was disappointed). My father-in-law had the chicken fried steak (this was one of the changes that the server mentioned; my FIL said that there was a lot more breading this time around). His wife had the fish and chips (my co-worker had this at the company luncheon a couple weeks ago) and she shared (the fish was really good, good sized, meaty, not fishy or anything- I would order this, but would share it, too). My husband's Grandma and her husband had the sirloin tips (two of my co-workers had this as is) but substituted/opted the potato cakes- 2 (phenomenal!!!). We also had a drink (merlot, pina colada, white zinfandel) with dinner, too BTW. So, for the most part, four out of the six in our party, really enjoyed Christmas Eve dinner here. 

The manager was sent over to explain that we could not use a partial credit (from $25 birthday reward) on my member card (this was not explained to us at our last visit to Rain Forest Cafe @ Downtown Disney) but he approved it anyway, and the tab was a little over $141.00. My overall rating of four stars is is still pretty good, what I had was really good, and the service was excellent. (One table didn't get their food, because it was mistakenly given to another table!) We would come here again (but for Christmas Eve dinner, it's always a different place every year)."}

We sat in the bar at one of the elevated tables and it was pretty nice ambiance, but nothing that made me want to come back. We shared the zucchini appetizer and it was so tasty I recommend it for sure! 
Turning into this place from the Parkway is a mess, as it's right near the 215 and I guess difficult to find the road to turn onto. The parking lot is gigantic though."}

My friend lives by this location and invited me out for a bday celebration. Well it started off great and Jason was entertaining. When it came down to the cooking it went down fast. A lady was vegetarian and kept advising him to not add egg in her rice and to use a separate utensil but he was drunk and kept forgetting. I'm not exaggerating he had like 4 sake bombs just at our table and he had a cup he kept drinking from. One of the other patrons actually commented on it and Jason said it was "tea" lol sure. But I digress. He was talking so much while making the rice he forgot about the vegetarian no egg in rice and my fiance and I noodles. he didn't even stir them once. he literally threw them on the grill and tossed them our plate a while after. they were dry, over cooked, and tasteless. I was livid as I could see where this was going. Hibachi isn't crazy expensive but it's not cheap either. I expect quality food at that price point. Anyways, I ask him to remake our noodles in a low tone and just so he could here. I wasn't trying to make a big deal but I wanted edible noodles. Well he made 3-4 lippy comments and by 3 or 4 I replied with an even more snippy response. I'm beyond irritated at this point. First he says while making my noodles that usually people tell him how they want their noodles in the beginning. Mind you there noodles expecting them to not be over cooled and have flavor shouldn't be deemed a preference more so a standard(this is what I was thinking but I didn't say it). Second time he puts the raw noodle on my plate and say this is how they come out. third thing, he makes a scene, while placing the noodles on my plate he says no one has ever said anything about . y noodles before and involves another patron at the table who was acknowledged as his friend. and start to pick at me as of I was being difficult. At this point I respond and advise the chef well I'm a regular at another location I know how noodles are suppose to taste and these aren't it. He made a couple more jabs. By the end he ordered like 3 more meats and looked around the table confused about who got what and started piling food on everyone's plate and to finish off the night you guessed it another sake bomb. He was obviously intoxicated. I will never go to this location again. I'm very upset I spent $90 on food I took home and threw away. The only salvageable food was the lobster and that was because I literally walked him through cooking it. I told him when to take it off and how much garlic n butter etc. Overall horrible experience. Maybe well most likely a different chief would have yielded a better experience."}

I haven't been there in a couple of years but I remember it being very good.  Went there on Saturday and ordered the 12 oz ribeye for $23.00.  It was so small and thin that It resembled more of a sausage patty.  It tasted ok, but my God!!!  $23.00 for that!!!   And my friend sent back her Chinese Chicken salad because the chicken was so dry you could choke on it and the dressing was pure sugar.  The only saving grace were the appetizers.  I will only go back for the southwest eggrolls, nothing else."}

We told them this and they took them away and a few minutes later they bring the SAME ones back as the half eaten one was still there.

My friend immediately went to the manager as this was unacceptable and there was cheese dripping out of the one which could have touched anything.. VERY unsanitary!  The manager then stated she would get fresh ones out right away.

When we asked for the check we asked if they are taking the skins off for us and the new bartender said "I'll get the manager to come talk to you about this."  As a manager myself that is the worst thing a guest can hear.  After having to send our food back twice I think the last thing they can do is remove the charge for this item.  The manager finally came over and said "oh yes I was going to take these off I was just going to tell you".

Probably won't be back.."}

The sushi and Chinese dishes are bad enough that no one in my dining group bothered to eat more than two bites or bring any "leftovers" home. If the menu was completely revamped and the food made better than perhaps this place can avoid the same fate as Pumi's. Otherwise, I would avoid this pricey tasteless restaurant at all costs."}

So we went to Claim Jumper knowing that our options are huge, and everyone would be sastisfied. Sure enough, our expectations were met. We started off with a creamy tortilla soup, fire roasted artichoke, and greens salad with in house made blue cheese dressing. All great, no complaints. 
Our dishes included tri tip, chicken pot pie, chicken wings, and the small (but no so small) portion of the chicken fried steak. Again, everything was pretty awesome. I did not like the fact that the pot pie came with fruit. Those 2 things don't go together. 
For dessert we had an apple crumble, an italian lemon cake, and a red velvet cupcake.
Nothing stood out like OMG I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS. But was everything delish? Yep. Will I return for great food next time someone is in town? Yep. 
Also, all that food, $102. 
Truly not bad at all. 
Service was also great, and our waiter mentioned he'd only been there for 4 days. I never would have know had he not told us. Looking forward to my next time here."}

The seating arrangement for the kids was superb. There was lots of space for socialization. The placement for the  birthday celebrant was lovely and perfect. 

Michael the manager gave us the best, cordial and service oriented crew. There wasn't anything they couldn't do to accommodate my guests. They allowed me to bring two cakes, they put them it in their refrigerator until serving time, then cut it in even pieces ready to serve.  

We never had to give them any instructions, they knew exactly what to do.

The service, however, could not suck harder. At one point, I think they decided to raise the cow who eventually would give the milk to make the cheese for my dish from a calf - starting the whole process when I ordered. Then, when we got to the dessert course, the waiter straight-up lied to us and said that it was taking a long time because there was a big rush from the happy hour at the bar, when, in reality, they simply didn't have the dessert we'd ordered. Took almost 30 minutes for the manager to come out and TELL us that, by which time, we were already late for our evening plans. 

I so wanted to like this one. Other Claim Jumpers to which I've gone don't have this problem. Front and back of house need a complete overhaul in staffing. When there's a total of 7 tables seated, it should not be 20 minutes between visits from your waiter. One should not have to make a pyramid of empty glasses on the table to make the point that we've run dry. If it didn't physically pain me not to leave a tip, I'd have left the dude a whopping zilch; as it is, what I left was out of pity - clearly, he'd not be able to get a job waiting tables anywhere else."}

We got there on a Friday night with no reservations around 9:00 p.m. Surprisingly we were seated rather immediately. 

We were sat with 2 other groups at a standard teppanyaki grill. First thing I noticed was great they try to fit more chairs at each table than is probably comfortable. I'm sure that's maximizing space. And I know it's like that in most places.

Second thing I noticed was the large menu. They do offer a lot of Chinese and Japanese dishes in their regular sit down menu. They have about a third of the restaurant set up for just normal sit down. 

Third thing I noticed was how the menus for the teppanyaki was set up. You start off with an $8.95 starter set. Choice of fried rice, brown rice, fried noodles or white rice. Then you get a salad, onion soup (no onions) and grilled vegetable medley. 

Then the other proteins are almost like sides and add ons. Everything you'd find in other places. Shrimp, scallops, lobster tail, filet, NY strip, and even Kobe beef for $48.95.

We added the filet for about $10. The chef walked out and started cooking. Asked everyone the basics like confirming orders and the how do you want your meat cooked.

Started off with the vegetable medley. Wasn't too impressed. Mainly broccoli. Something about broccoli on a grill just didn't taste right 2/5.

Second was the fried rice and everyone had and that lacked flavor. 2/5. For as cool as the show was, the flavor was lacking. More like fast food Chinese take out to be honest. Most other places use Gaelic butter. I think that's what's missing.

The soup came out and it had those fried Asian noodles in it that you'd get back in the 80s at Chinese family restaurants. Also lacked flavor 2/5.

Salad was ok. Not the standard ginger dressing but more like a thousand island 3/5.

The chef was good. Had us laughing. 

Meat started next. No shrimp appetizer like most places. You can add that on if you want.

My filet was cooked good. I asked for it rare. It came rare. I've the cut a 4:5 but the mustard sauce and the ginger sauce were way too sweet. Couldn't use either for my filet. Ended up salt and peppering my steak.

Overall the place is clean, staff is friendly but I'd rather dish out the extra cash and make a trip out to Benihana."}

I understood and said no big deal. The cook, server and manager were so worried I was ok which was so awesome I explained it happens and it's ok. They came over when it was time to pay the bill and gave us 20% off (which was not necessary) but they wanted to let us know they were sorry.

When you think of Happy hour you think of full size appetizers at or around half price. This is not the case at Claim Jumper.  We were very disappointed and really felt cheated during this happy hour experience.  We were greeted the moment we sat down by our waiter, Hunter,  who took our drink and food order. We ordered 4 items and our server offered us a loaf of cheese bread while we waited. The apps came quickly but when they came we all 3 looked at each other and said these are not full size appetizers. This was quickly confirmed when neither the zucchini or the artichoke dip looked anything like what was displayed on the happy hour sign at the front door or the picture of the artichoke dip on the happy hour menu itself.  We got 7 zucchini, 4 coconut shrimp and a artichoke dip that was served in a tiny oval ramekin and not in the mini iron skillet in all the happy hour pics.  These were half size apps at half size prices.  When the manager asked if every thing was ok and I asked him about the apps he said these are our happy hour portions and walked away.  NOWHERE on the menu do you mention that these are reduced portion sizes.  We left a 20% tip as the service by Hunter was fantastic but we will never return to CJ for Happy Hour."}

It is HUGE ! I suggest reading it on-line before you go, in order to narrow down your selections. Seriously. We started out with the beef teriyaki and shrimp tempura appetizers. The tempura came with vegetables which I appreciated. The tempura was light and crisp. Very good. For dinner, I ordered the Gyu-Ishiyaki which was excellent. The garlic butter was superb on the rock before cooking the beef. My husband had the short ribs and they were delicious. He felt there should have been more meat on the bone, and I can't disagree, but the flavor was tremendous. Service was excellent and we will definitely return."}

The place is gorgeous, the hibachi chef we had, Jason, was a hoot and we will ask for him every time now, the food was excellent and the prices even better! It was our family Valentines day dinner. The five of us ate to our hearts content, we ordered an extra order of scallops and an extra order of shrimp, 4 sapporos, a couple of sodas, and two desserts. The bill came to $150 bucks! You absolutely can't beat that for a hibachi dinner..that comes out to about $30 a person and included all the extras on VALENTINES DAY, when alot of restaurants charge higher rates. It's our new favorite place! See you there!"}

I am disappointed with some of the menu changes since CJ's was bought out by Landry's.  The service is usually pretty good.  There is nothing phenomenal about the restaurant, but it is still good food...although a but pricey for some items ...$4.99 for a cup of soup is a bit steep for the portion size.  We tend to eat in the bar where it's a bit more relaxed.  Just avoid the bar on Friday nights as the Zappos crowd is a bit loud. They are not obnoxious...just loud...and it slows down service a bit. 

Menu favorites: all of the salads, potato cheese soup, pretzel sticks, gigantic club sandwich, chicken/mashed potato/cinnamon apple dish (PLEASE BRING BACK THIS DISH WITH PORK!!!)"}

Roe had to leave for a family emergency & was also great.  Chassir was right on top of business w/ service, drinks & food.. awesome!  

Wish the food was as exceptional cause I would give five stars for both, but rarely the case.  Our mini cheese HH pizza was dripping w/ a pool of grease & I can assure you that even for the $5 HH price, I would not eat it for free.  Hours later we still regretted even eating one slice.  Thankfully we didn't try the mini pepperoni cause I can't imagine the grease on it.    

The only worthwhile item on the HH, as I've found out the hard way is the Wedge.  Very fresh & crisp Lettuce & I love balsamic & blue cheese mixed.  The bacon on it & red onion were in perfect portions & I asked for no tomato.  

Excellent portion so just take off the Spinach & Artichoke, mini pizzas & add the calamari or something.  I am totally satisfied w/ five stars for the HH Wedge, but it's like hit or miss w/ the other items on HH.  I even got a free item for our bday month in June & was still left disappointed in their food.  You end up spending more on HH to get satisfied or have to complain.  I have eaten off of the regular menu & the best item is the calamari & dessert!  Next time, will have to try that again.  It's a large portion also.  Add the Wedge & I think it would be a perfect meal.  We will see next time."}

It was a bit dry and the muffin was way too sweet (sugar coated....ugh overkill...lose the sugar).

Food is overpriced and not that good considering. The whole thing was just a waste of time and money.

Love the $1.50 pretzels with cheese sauce (request this stuff for sure!).. they are incredible and completely worth blowing your diet for. These are normally priced $3.50 and I'd still pay that price for them.. soo much yummier than the ones at the mall or the ballpark or wherever you usually eat pretzels. 

I also recommend the Irish nachos for $2.50, and the pizza rollis for $2.75... if you are looking to get full on deliciously calorific junkfood at bargain basement prices, come here.

I'd mention as for the non-happy hour menu/prices.. I find this place like a better cheesecake factory. Better food, prices, etc."}

Even though my friends and I were not too hungry, the appetizer, soup, and sliders were enough to put us pass satisfied. The calamari ($11.99) were cut from some monster squid that always makes me think of eating rubber bands. The French Onion soup survived the down scale in size that some other dishes did not. The sliders came in an order of four with a pile of shoestring fries. Another friend had joined later on. He ordered the chicken tortilla soup and a chicken bow tie pasta. With an alcoholic drink, the total bill came to less than fifty before tip. I always enjoy the French onion, but otherwise it was a mediocre meal.

I had the red velvet bunt cake which was the cake was light and airy and the frost was creamy not too rich.  We also dove into some calamari and the slaw that comes with it yum!!! The slaw reminds me of a Chinese chicken salad. I usually hate slaw but this one yum!!! The calamari was thick cuts of calamari which was coated perfectly and crispy on the out tender on the inside."}

I don't know what is wrong at this Claim Jumper. It used to be OK, but now it was just BAD.  We had the Spinach Artichoke dish ($11.99 which we had before and it was good), but now it just tasted really bad and weird.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce or what -- but it was not edible. I tried their Potato Skins ($10.99) which was just 1 whole Potato and 1/2 each half was cut into 4 small pieces and put around a large dip saucer in the middle (see pic) so that it would look like more.  It was so boring and bland (no taste except for some bacon bits), that it had to be drowned in the sauce / dip (now I knew why the saucer was so big) to have any flavor!  
RESULTS: A really bad tummy ache and upset stomach that didn't digest the food!  
WARNING:  Don't go here! Don't eat here! Something is wrong in the kitchen - and your tummy will pay the price, aside from you over- spending on disgusting and terrible tasting food!"}

First time at a Claim Jumpers and it won't be my last. Our server's name was Dillon, and he was awesome!! We had a party of 8, and he shared with us their most popular appetizers and main dishes. We had the zucchini sticks and onion rings to start, we also ordered their famous homemade strawberry lemonade and tropical tea (which are both bottomless btw). He also helped suggest a better way of ordering one of their lunch items for a better deal which my dad appreciated. We didn't save room for dessert, but it was my uncle's birthday and Dillon was nice enough to bring out a small dessert for us to try. I'm pretty sure it was a buttercake...whatever it was...it was SO GOOD, left my dad speechless.  It was like a half and half mix between "haole brownie" if you're from Hawaii you know what that is and CPKs butter cake.

He ordered Chicken Fried Steak and mashed potatoes. I had the chopped steak and mashed potatoes with cheesy garlic bread. I had a glass of Apple Cider Beer to wash the food down. The Chicken Fried Steak seemed to have shrunk in size from what my husband remembers. His dinner salad had no taste, he said. I had the Caesar salad it wasn't bad. The chopped steak was good, the bread was good. My husband wasn't thrilled with his dinner. Too much batter not enough meat.

The waiter wasn't very attentive, though he did let me sample the cider before I ordered it. It just seemed the table next to us got more attention from their waitress. Like bringing the pepper mill for their salad and checking on them. Then we had a long wait on getting the bill.
Maybe the Claim Jumper is passed it's time?"}

I ate here on a weeknight and the restaurant still had a nice crowd. We did make a reservation to be safe and were seated immediately. There was another party at our table, but the hostess spaced us out so that we weren't on top of each other which was nice. Dinner started leisurely with time to choose drinks and a sushi starter. Our waitress was attentive with help from other staff as well. 

Before the chef arrived for dinner and a show we were served salad and an onion soup. I really liked the soup and I loved the cold ginger dressing on the salad. Once the chef (and the show) arrives the fried rice (or noodles) comes up followed by veggies and then the protein of your choice. I loved all of my food and found it to be even better than I expected. The portions were definitely not lacking either. The pricing was much less than I expected for Hibachi as well.

This is a nice spot for good food with friends or family. I'd definitely recommend coming in here in a group."}

I was always happy with the meals I got, but I did stick with what I knew for the most part. I mean let's face it there isn't THAT much opportunity to really get crazy and branch out here.

The salads in my opinion are great. Huge and if you get the lunch specials big portion for a great price. The portions of everything are massive so come hungry. The chicken pot pie is one of the best I've ever had. There is usually a good selection of soups including a yummy French Onion and Chicken Tortilla. 

Dessert is a new level of portion size depending on what you get. At least LOOK at the dessert case as you walk in, just to stare in awe. The berry pies are awesome and if you get it to go there are instructions on how to warm it up best at home. 

The service can vary from server to server. Sometimes they're at your beckoned call and other times it takes some flagging down to get attention. We almost always sat in the bar area so that could be part of the issue, it's a bit off the beaten path. 

Given they have changed their menu around a bit since they were bought out by Landry's but I didn't notice a major change in selection or quality. With Landry's as their parent company if you join their discount club you can earn reward points at a wide range of restaurants."}

We had a reservation for 5:00 and arrived early. We were seated at 4:55 and noticed that the other diners at the hibachi table already had appetizers and drinks. 

The waitress (Susanna?) came over and gave us our menus and asked what we wanted to drink and if we were ready to order. She was not the least bit friendly. We hadn't even opened the menus yet. We placed our drink orders and the soup and salads were placed in front of us and the other guests. She brought our drinks and again asked what we wanted to order. It was a really bad way to start our dining experience. 

The food and the hibachi chef were good but nothing exceptional. One thing I don't like is getting all the components separately. I had finished each one before the next was ready. First came the fried rice, then the meat (which was a small portion) and then veggies were last. The check was brought before we were even finished eating or offered a dessert menu which I had to ask for. We actually left a little hungry.

Hostess no where to be found at a pretty big restaurant. Sat ourselves in the saloon area. 

I think only two servers, and couple food runners were working at that time. I wouldn't blame them it was dead in the restaurant area. 

Anyway, we were able to order from the happy hour menu and got the calamari and the spinach artichoke dip. 

They have awesome drink happy hour selection, but the food.... Save your money on more drinks and skip them. 

Happy hour portions of appetizers are very small. The calamari doesn't even look like calamari. Lol. Spinach artichoke dip was pretty good, but you get a way bigger portion for around the same price at like YardHouse.

The service was awesome tho! Wish I can say that about the food too."}

My only complaint:  it's hard to find the parking lot!  We made several wrong turns, but hunger pushed us forward until we eventually found the parking lot."}

I cannot say enough things about our server. He was the epitome of a waiter, and I seriously left him a 50% tip. Friendly, efficient, helpful and just plain funny --- he really made our meal fun and was joking around with the kids the whole time.

As far as the food goes -- Claim Jumpers' bread is delicious and I feel like I've gained ten pounds just after having a few buttery slices. After loading up on bread, we couldn't finish our "real meals." Lol..

My BBQ chicken sandwich was enormous (all of their meals are truly made for two here) and tasty. My younger daughter ordered a pizza which was reportedly good. My older daughter went with chicken fingers and basically none of us could finish anything we ordered. In a nutshell, we took most of our dinner home after gorging ourselves on bread. 

However, the price is decent and the customer service was outstanding. Not to mention, we have tons of leftovers!"}

We called RIGHT before we were all going over there, and they were ready with a table as soon as we got there.  Apparently half my group knows the manager Maris, and this lady took great care of us.  The service was very good to handle 13 people; our waiter came by to refill drinks and everyone seemed to need something on the side and he still brought requested items back in a timely fashion.
Here is the clinker...when I was ordering, the waiter told me I ordered one of the healthiest dishes on the menu (not true..haha).  I know these chain restaurants are notorious for bad-for-you food, but until the person next to me found nutritional information on the table, I was in the dark.  
*Bravo to Claim Jumper for publishing the nutritional information for every menu item and putting it on the table.  This is great for diabetics, etc and is actually quite impressive.
*It is my psychological problem that I felt the need to look at it once I knew it was there, and learned that 99% of the menu items had more than any human's (besides sumo wrestlers or Michael Phelps) caloric intake, 600 times the sodium intake, etc.  I was frightened when I saw my order's nutrition so I just ate half and then walked for hours after at the District, and am eating a lean cuisine right now.
*Like everyone else said, the menu is huge with lots of choices, but the food is nothing spectacular.
*The mango iced tea is unsweetened and yummy.
*MAJOR bravo for the vegetarian menu.  Most of my group eats vegetarian out and even as regulars, did not know about this.  You have to ask for it but there are tons of veggie options!
*summary: good service, average food, nice ambiance, kudos for published albeit scary nutritional info, brownie points for veggie menu

UPDATE 11/18/09: Tilapia Veracruz is awesome.  I never usually eat tilapia but this is zesty, rich in flavor, and has avocado! mmm!"}

The food is good although it can be slightly greasy with no flavour, i also recommend the Jamaican sweet potatoe (it comes with jerk chicken and clover honey...yummy!) and a good pudding is the green tea creme brule (it tastes better than it sounds!) it's a tiny pudding, about 6 mouthfuls but it's totally snacky!"}

We've been to this Ohjah multiple times and usually it's pretty good. Tonight we went and every single part of my hibachi dinner was horrific. 

The chef comes to the table, and he verified each persons order and asked how everyone would like their meat cooked. I ordered my steak rare. He starts making the fried rice first, and once it's done he's somehow confused about who ordered which sides. Everyone at the table ordered fried rice except one person who wanted noodles and one person who wanted fried rice without egg. So he separates the fried rice without egg first and gives it to the person. Then put egg in the rest of it. He's somehow confused about who has fried rice once it's done cooking. He starts passing it out starting with the two people on my right, then somehow skips me and serves my husband and the entire rest of the table. Then he's STILL confused about who had fried rice. Well now that I'm the last person and he's been confused the entire time I get maybe 1/2 a bowl of rice while everyone got a full helping and since he waited so long and tried to make the bowl fuller by scraping all the burnt bits off the grill, mine is entirely burnt and crunchy and pretty much inedible.

Next came the vegetables. Thinking he'd feel bad for messing up the rice I thought I'd maybe get adequate vegetables but I was wrong. He went around starting on the other side so I was one of the last people and my portion was 75% onions and I got very little of a portion anyway, while he then passed around extras to others. 

He then started the meat. He's cooking all of it and AGAIN comes back to me to ask the temperature of cook I'd like, I again say rare and he responds with "medium rare?", I say "no, rare" and he says "medium rare?" I say again "no rare" and he says "oh, okay, rare!" So I have he audacity to think that this is the one part of my meal he'd get right. NOPE! There's shrimp, lobster, chicken, and two types of steak on the grill. Somehow, my steak is the LAST thing to come off the grill and it's WELL DONE, like dry nasty well done. I'm fuming at this point and $70 later I didn't get to enjoy any of the hibachi dinner and left hungry. I hate being the person who sends food back or asks for the manager and with how irritated I was I just wanted to go home. I would never want to have that chef again and I probably won't be back as I've never had bad hibachi until tonight."}

 The food comes pretty quickly and always makes me happy. 

 The desserts are huge in portions. We ordered the mother load last night and  yeah, i have enough for something yummy tonight in the fridge for me and my room-mate. 


   You can walk right in and usually it's not a long wait. The staff are friendly and good with people. I love coming here for a meal with friends or sometimes by myself if I feel like a little treat without breaking the bank. Dress is casual.

I had the shrimp Fresca. Which I thought meant fresh? Not so much. The spinach for having been cooked and looking dreadful, was very chewy. The "parmesan" crusted shrimp tasted more like shaken 'n bake.

If you order the shrimp, the chef plays a little game with you where he throws the shrimp. Then, he makes a volcano and train out of the onions. You'll see when you come ha. 

The hibachi consists of onion soup, house salad, your protein, and choice of fried rice, brown rice, and noodles."}

However, you can pick up your order. I picked an order for 5 people which they said would be done in 20 minutes, I was impressed so quick, especially on a Friday night.  I arrived exactly 20 minutes later, but the food took another 5 minutes...no big deal.   However, when I got home, my Sashimi was missing.  I paid $92 with a tip of $10, remember I picked up my food...so I think that is generous. I called to let them know, and they said can you come back to pick it up?  At this point I didn't want it anymore, and asked to have it refunded. They proceeded to tell me they can't do that without me there.  Well I am not about to spend the rest of my night to resolve a $10 refund.  Besides, I own my own business and I KNOW you can do a refund over the phone, and I was telling the 3rd person I spoke with how to do it...and for some reason after he did it, he had a very canned disclaimer..."please allow 72 to see the refund". Hmmm, so you have done a refund over the phone before? Seems like you might have... 

Anyway, the frustrating call, kind of ruined our meal. It was not that great, I gave the chicken teriyaki after I rinsed it off and gave it to the dogs.  The chicken was rubbery and dry at the same time, and doused in sauce.  I just had sushi earlier that day, and this was a let down, rolls are small, in terms of fish and veggies, rice was sufficient.  Fish didn't taste fresh.

If you're a fan of huge portions and a very broad menu, Claim Jumpers will not disappoint. The staff is very friendly and the food I've ordered has never been anything less than amazing. The prices are a little steep, so don't go in expecting neighborhood diner prices. But you get what you pay for and that's excellent food. Certain I'll be back a few more times in the near future. The places is overall clean and presentable so I give kudos to management and staff. Great job and keep up the good work. This visit was for my Mom's 80th birthday pre-celebration and they gave her a free piece of red velvet cake with a candle. They didn't light the candle however (weird) but that's ok. :)"}

My main issue is that when the food runner brought our food out, he asked if we wanted anything else? I politely asked if I could have another order of their bread (I got chowder,so I wanted to dip the bread in it). Our server just checked on us riight after the runner gave us our food, so it didn't occur to me to ask her for bread again, seeing as I don't want them to bring 2 rolls out if they didn't need to.... we're Eating, time passed, no bread, couldn't see our server nearby so I just asked another one for bread.... she says okay.... and once again nothing. Our server never checked in again until we were already done. The chowder was meh anyway (you try coming from a coastal state and moving to NV), but that's not the point here. I was disappointed in the service.... the runner should have brought the bread out and the other server should've told our server that we were requesting something. 

It was happy hour so I can't complain about the prices and my bf enjoyed his food. But we won't be returning."}

It was the perfect timing because about thirty minutes later the restaurant was packed!  A huge flame from the hibachi grill on the right, a small bar on the left, a sushi bar in the far back & in between is the dining area.  Cozy atmosphere.  
 
Adrienne, our great bartender, was a sweetheart & made my new concoction of a Cherry & Vanilla Vodka spritzer perfecto!  Cody, our server, was absolutely fantastic as well.  He took our order w/o writing it down & in between getting our hot sauce, he didn't forget a thing.  Friendly, courteous, patient, always smiling, like Adrienne & he knows the menu very well.  Brought everything out accordingly & thankfully my friend received coupons in the mail that he used.  One was a free Shrimp Tempura Roll & a Large Sake, both w/ the purchase of an entree.  

My friend & I shared the Filet Mignon dinner that came w/ Miso Soup, salad, brown rice & veggies.  Our friend had the Shrimp Tempura dinner that also came w/ the same.  Our tender filet had a teriyaki sauce & the salad dressing was delish mmm!  The shrimp tempura batter was heavier than the usual, but next time I'll see if they could do it lighter.  Both dinners were very filling & large enough to share for the three of us!

I rarely do hibachi anymore unless it's a special occasion, but I will be back to try their sushi & if I do dinner will have to request Adrienne & Cody again.  Awesome!"}

THANKSGIVING.  I love cooking Thanksgiving dinner, but since it's only me and my fiancé, he has requested that I quit utterly destroying the kitchen with my turkey-cooking antics.  The last two years, we have ordered Thanksgiving meals from Claim Jumper instead.  Boy, am I glad... fewer dishes that way!

I'll let you in on a little secret too... their kid-sized Thanksgiving dinners are MASSIVE.  So big, in fact, that you can order them and still have leftovers for the next day.  And they are only $10.  For poor kids like us, that's a steal.  We always order ahead of time and pick up our plates.  The first year, we tried to dine in.  Never again.  Two-hour wait times are no joke.

Other than Thanksgiving, I cannot think of a plausible reason to eat at Claim Jumper.  Sure, I have eaten here for a regular meal before... it just wasn't anything to write home about.  And the portions are so darn big that it's almost sickening staring at the plate.  It's truly horrific that they offer things that are so high in calories.  If I'm gonna put myself into a food coma from eating something that massive, it had better be worth it... Claim Jumper isn't.

All four stars are for Thanksgiving dinner, which is always delicious.  If I were rating this on a normal day, it would MAYBE get two stars.  But Yelping about the holiday season (especially in April) makes me feel generous, so four stars it is.  Happy holidays, Claim Jumper.  Don't say I never gave you anything."}

A few times before the service was slow and the waiter would never stop by and refill our drinks.  It would take at least 30 minutes to get out food out and another long wait to get our checks.  However, lately I've been seating at the saloon/bar area and the service is great and gotta love the happy hour.  Decent prices and the food is good especially the pretzels! Also, one of my favorite desserts that they have is the chocolate chip calzone, it is amazing.  especially if you love chocolate and its pretty filled with chocolate goodness :) its always worth getting."}

I had been here once before during happy hour and the food/drink specials at the bar were great!  Another time I went for lunch and felt jipped by the prices, but I guess that's because the happy hour deals were so good.  

I do like the atmosphere of this restaurant - much nicer than an Applebees or Friday's but not "stuffy" or too fancy.  Just right for a casual lunch or meeting friends for an "easy" dinner and drinks night out.  The service has always been good here but still, I can't help but thinking that I'm never blown away by the food.  

I think the thing that was most surprising was that they were getting cleaned up and ready to close at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  We had to move the gathering back to the house. 

I think I'll keep this on my list of "pretty darn good happy hours"."}

The way you order your meal is a little different then most places you go, other places you go you pick your meal for instance chicken and steak and it's 24.99 and you know rice, salad and soup is coming with it but here you order your base which is fried or steamed rice, salad, soup and veggies with your meal and that's 8.99 then you pick your meats and they have a list of meats or seafoods to pick from with their prices listed so you add your meat and your base price then you get your total meal price. I kind of like the way they do this because if you just want one or the other and not both your not charged the huge fee and a bunch of food your not going to eat.  I'm always impressed with how fast the salad and soup come out and usually the chef comes out within 5 minutes of ordering. We have been here 4 or 5 times and we have never been disappointed by our chef they all have been entertaining and friendly. One in particular we really you loved and I wish I could remember his name but he included our 2 year old in the show and made her feel like part of the group by giving her pieces of veggies and a little bit of fried rice of her own (we don't order for her since she just picks off of our plates) we appreciated that so much because most people just pretend she's not there and interact with our 8 year Olds. We have never been disappointed by our food everything we have ordered has always had great flavor and left us saying wow that was a great meal. We also aways order a sushi roll which always comes out tasting fresh and yummy my favorite roll is the love roll. It's a must try if you love sushi you will thank yourself for it!

An easy 4 stars from me, one star deducted because the prices are insanely high for the type of food they're serving here.

Had the filet mignon & a lobster tail my wife had the NY steak. All cooked to perfection. Was more than enough to eat & I saw some of the sushi plates and other dinners and everything looked great.
Busy place so make reservations!"}

I grew up on this but today was the worst. The quality went down from when i last ate from here. I usually do take out but today for easter me and my family wanted to dine in. 
I ordered what I usually ordered the classic, "Roasted Tri tip". The sides I picked was the roasted veggies, mash potato and caesar's salad. First that came was the salad and it looked so bad. i counted less than 20 cabbage and 2 croutons with barely any dressing. It was so shitty. I had to order the croutons and the dressing which i didn't have to do before. Next was the main dish. The tri tips. I liked my meat medium rare but this dish was hard and the slices are paper thin. My mother ordered the same exact order except she chose chowder soup instead of the salad and rice instead of the mash. Her soup was way over cook plus the rice looked like the rice you had for leftovers and was stuck in a fridge and heated in a microwave. This use to be my most favorite steakhouse. Unfortunately today the quality went super low. Very very disappointed."}

We have dined in this restaurant several times a while back and had good meals and even wrote excellent reviews about our experience. But this time we ordered takeout. Takeout service was fast. The takeout packaging was good. We went there to get the tenderloin tips with mashed potatoes but its not on the menu anymore. So I ordered rotisserie chicken ($17.99) which was very bland. I had much better rotisserie chicken from supermarket! The mashed potatoes were thick like concrete and flavorless, the gravy was very strong and unique tasting, vegetables were different too. I didn't even like the potato cheddar soup....had huge round pieces of carrots in it eww. Husband had clam chowder soup he said was okay. He had the meatloaf ($15.99) which was the weirdest meatloaf I've ever seen and he said it was terrible. The chocolate cake ($11.99, not a typo!) was huge and packaged in a nice box but hubby said it was terrible. Total was $52.25 (LOL!)....we got ripped off."}

We have been wanting to try this place since it opened but waited until the crowd died down. 
The food, service, and atmosphere were good.
We started our dining with vegetable tempura. It was amazing and I think I could have eaten 2 orders and be full. Our entrees were teriyaki chicken, miso soup, salad, and rice I upgraded to fried rice for $2 more. The filet mignon teriyaki with miso, salad, and brown rice. 
The chicken was as expected not to die for but good. The filet was cooked well and tender but again not to die for. If your into fried rice its worth the upgrade. Both of our meals were good and we would be back since it's so close to home. 

The biggest problems we had with the restaurant was the entrees weren't very hot (temperature) and when I called to make a reservation I requested the tatami and they said since it was only 2 of us it would need to be a $200 minimum. What is this the strip? That was a joke! Especially since it wasn't even busy. 

We did notice that a couple got the sushi boat! That looked dank... we will have to try that next time."}

The last thing Sushi Cafe is, is just another sushi joint. Bento Cafe? Sushi burrito Cafe? Lunch box Cafe? Poki Cafe? All of those would bring more people in and would better describe their menu. 
I think the highlight of Sushi Cafe is their Protein Box lunches. Rice, veggies, seaweed salad, korokke, egg and your choice of meat = Protein box. The Monster Box includes a giant sushi burrito and 5 pieces of sushi. SUCH a good deal AND they serve it in those cute brown boxes and not styrofoam- yippeee! 
I've had the fried white fish and the chicken protein box.
Fried white fish: I was a little worried at first (it looked like the frozen fish sticks you can buy), but they were far from it. There was plenty of fish in it and it tasted GOOD. I loved it, but for me, having fried fish and also fried korokke in the box was a little too much fry for me. It put me into a food coma way too fast. 
Chicken protein box: yes, yes, yes. So much chicken! The sauce is in a container on the side so you don't have to be worried about it being drenched in teriyaki. 

The sushi bento boxes were another story. 
The quality of the nigiri was HORRIBLE and the giant rolls were pretty bad. The salmon in my roll was so tough I couldn't bite through it. It was like chewing on rubber- a couple of bites of that and I had to spit it out. It was easily the worst piece of fish I've ever had. I would not recommend ordering anything with raw fish from here. 

There is no AC in Sushi Cafe................................ I wouldn't recommend eating here, just taking out on your lunch break or on your way home. They also have some Japanese snacks, drinks (Calpis, etc) for sale and cup noodle with a hot water machine as well."}

This is great for lunch or dinner. The owners are very nice and welcoming. The inside is nice and clean, so no complaint there. 

I highly recommend this place and I will be returning customer as long as they are open! Check this place out if you haven't, totally worth it. :)"}

Concept is, fast, take-out like eatery but this is Why they are able to give you quality grade sushi; Fresh!!! They do not have waiters or waitresses, to help keep overhead costs down, & with what they save they are able to buy you Fresh grade sushi right from a Japanese Vendor, & (let's not kid ourselves) who knows fish better than those who created "Sushi?" ...when one eats sushi, 1st question you should ask restaurant is, "where do you get your fish?" ...very important question, to avoid Mercury, food poisoning, etc! Oh, & they cater too!!! I would recommend to anyone who loves sushi but don't want to spend loads of cash downtown on expensive restaurants just to get fresh sushi! & the owners are so friendly!!!!"}

I was a bit thrown off by how we order. I thought they'd sit you first but you have to order first, and if you're eating "for here", they'll tell you to sit and they bring your food to you, then you pay when you're done eating. The only menu I saw were boards on the wall so it was hard to see what I was ordering. There were just names and I didn't know what was in any of the rolls. I had to depend on Yelp (thank you!). 

Service was great, though! The cashier/waitress was very friendly. The wait for our food wasn't too bad either. 

I ordered a combo bowl. I was hesitant about the price (~$12) but when I saw what was actually included in my bowl, I understood why. I got raw salmon, spicy tuna, surimi crab, seaweed salad, masago, avocado, ginger, rice, some greens, and probably other things that were hidden under everything else. I enjoyed by food and was happy to be bringing home leftovers. 

The price for a roll is pretty affordable and two rolls can fill you up. I'd definitely come here for rolls if I don't want to spend so much on AYCE. ~$4.50 for nigiri may be pushing it, so I'll probably do AYCE somewhere else for that."}

After giving it a chance, I'm thoroughly impressed and much happier than I would have been at the other place. It'll be my definite go-to place for quick and good quality food, plus the friendly service is a bonus. 
They also sell some authentic Asian desserts/snacks and drinks like cheesecake, pocky, calpico, tea, and hello panda. 
I will definitely come back for more!"}

Right when I walked in, I already felt comfortable seeing lounge couches included as the dining seats. I had to take up this area good for 4 persons at a table. They have a back patio decor combined with Asian accents. Lighting is great along with the fixtures. I see that they have a sushi bar not in use and they should install bar stools along the counter. They can open up that concept to make the experience personal with the sushi chef.  

I took a picture of the menu, so you could find it in the photos to pick out your options. 

Personally, I ordered the Bulgogi Box $9.00 which comes complete with rice, seaweed salad and tamago. I also added a shrimp tempura appetizer. 

My friends all did sushi roll orders that start at $5.95 

The owner of the cafe complimented our lunch with a free waffle mochi ice cream w/ red bean paste and strawberry syrup toppings. He made our experience feel like top class!"}

My brother suggested this place, as I said I was craving some seafood. It's a cute little spot located in a not too busy shopping plaza. Walking in, my sis and I thought you walk up to the counter to order, so we sat our stuff down at a table. The gal working the counter quickly approached us with menus and said she would be right with us. She was helping some people standing by the counter (they were reading the wall menus). We ordered a beef bulgogi box which came with rice, seaweed salad, tamago and pickled veg. Also with our order was a miso soup, tuna poke and poke bowl (half ahi and half white fish). I felt like the bulgogi was a little on the dry side and wasn't as flavorful as other bulgogi dishes I've had in the past. I believe the tuna poke, for the price, was lacking in amount. The quality of the fish was excellent! The miso soup was basic and satisfying and the poke bowl was huuuuuuge. Yummy and HUGE. Just a heads up, the poke bowl came with a set variation of toppings and sauce. I'm sure it could be customizable, but I didn't bother to ask. I didn't mind, everything about that poke bowl was perfection! PS, skip the edamame."}

He is super picky like me but I knew we would find some stuff we both liked. When we walked in there was only one person who had ordered takeout. It was on a Monday around 2pm. The host was very welcoming and told us to sit where ever we liked. We took our seats and started looking at the menu. They have a pretty good variety of items at a really decent price. Our waitress/host came back to take our drink order, we both ordered fountain drinks which we could have poured ourselves but she insisted on doing it for us. When she brought our drinks over she asked my brother to taste his because it looked flat. It was indeed so she instead brought him over a canned soda. I felt that was a step above what most places would do. We ended up ordering an appetizer and 4 rolls. Everything was absolutely amazing! The rolls were perfect and tasted so fresh. The service was great and the price could not be beat. In CA my husband and I had a place we would go to regularly and never left paying under $40 (not including tip) our order was pretty similar to what my brother and I ordered here. The price we paid at Sushi Cafe was only $22.95 (again not including tip) that is a huge price difference for basically the same meal! I am totally going to bring my husband here!

Now to serious business. The deep fried potato thingy is so crunchy and delicious! Yesterday i took my mom there. She had a box and really liked it. I had for the first time a tuna bowl. This is seriously the BEST tuna bowl ever. No joke. I felt it was very spicy. But itms me, i cant handle spicy. But it didnt matter i ate it all. It was huge. This guys don't disappoint. Everything i had so far has been excellent! The other day i had one meal that was like a burrito and it was delicious. 
One thing i love is that is very casual. 
My girls love the little panda bear cookies"}

She knows her stuff!  The price range was perfect--not expensive and perfect portion sizes.  The food itself was worth the five stars alone.  The fried rice was light and full of flavor, and at the same time was not too oily.  The gyoza was cooked the right way and made on site, which was easy to tell by the balance of sight, texture and flavor. Hands down the best gyoza I've had at a restaurant in Vegas.  
Food was hot and fresh and beer was nice and cold.  I anticipate trying the ramen next time; I just did not have that much of an appetite today.  
I will be returning here from now on.  Perfect spot for a lunch or happy hour break!!"}

She was very skeptical at first. She had only tried Sushi once in Virginia. Upon ordering the lady at the counter was very helpful in helping her to make a decision on what she wanted. I explained to her my allergy and she assured me that they have other items on the menu that did not contain seafood.

My daughter absolutely love her California rolls and cannot wait to go back. The prices are amazing it doesn't break the budget. The decor is very nice. This is definitely going to be on the top of our list of places to eat when we are undecided for dinner."}

We were looking for something light for dinner to grab and take home last night. I have had this on my list and sushi is light so this was the winner.

My first impression is that the restaurant is very clean and simple. The employee working at the counter greeted us immediately. He gave us a paper menu to look at and help us decide what to order since we were obviously there for the first time.

Our order came up in about five minutes which I thought was fast for a walk in order. Everything was packaged nicely and they even included napkins, silverware, chopsticks, and soy sauce. 

All of the rolls we ordered were very good and fresh. They were notably better than other sushi I've had recently. The Lemon Roll was my favorite and the lemon added a great twist to the flavor. The Shrimp Tempura Roll was delicious and had plenty of crunchy topping. The Mexican Roll had the perfect amount of avocado on top and the right amount of heat. My edamame wasn't very tender and not my favorite item. The Green Tea Cheesecake sounded interesting, but was not my cup of tea, pun intended. There was nothing wrong with the cheesecake, it just wasn't my thing.

The menu definitely offers more than just rolls so I'm excited to return and try more of the menu items."}

We stopped by for dinner on a Monday evening. There was no one else there, so we were seated immediately.

We'd been here before, but it seems many things have changed.

Their menu is basically useless. There are no descriptions at all about what is in the dishes/rolls. And, unfortunately, our server's mastery of English was not good enough to explain what was in the food. They've also listed some roll names on their chalkboards, but again, no explanation of what they are and no prices.

Ultimately, our food was just okay. There are other restaurants nearby with equal or better quality food where you know exactly what you are ordering. Unless they fix this critical problem I think Sushi Cafe might be in for tough times ahead."}

The food here is really good! They're focus is somewhat healthier versions of US sushi. Def not the most traditional food, but quite tasty. The owners/staff were really friendly and took their time explaining their food and concept and went out of their way to be welcoming overall. 

   As I'm not a huge raw-fish fan, I went with the spicy pork bento, an order of gyoza, and an order of edamame (I was in a large group and intended to share some gyoza and edamame). Everything was quite tasty! I really enjoyed the pork, though it could have been spicier, and the rice was really good too! It's a mix of white and brown and topped with furikake. The meal also came with a few pickles, a small seaweed salad, and a gorokke (croquette). Their croquette is again, intended to be lighter, and is mixed with kabocha for a sweeter taste, rather than having a sauce. The gyoza also came without a sauce, but I found on both parts I wasn't quite missing anything. 

   The only kinda of negatives to watch out for, are that this place does all of its plating in to-go boxes. While this is super easy for a quick lunch or post-work out dinner, it may not be the most special date-night, if you're looking for something fancy. Also, the edamame are only lightly salted, not coated in the rock salt in used to. It's still really tasty, just not what I was expecting. Also, they don't have a liquor license, so no after-class beer and edamame at this time, which is probably better for my waist line anyway.

Overall a great little place. It's definitely going to be my new Friday night after-class hangout!"}

In Henderson and is specializing in the quick, casual, Asian style cafe. So far, it's only been open for a couple of days, and after trying it out, it's a decent place to go for a quick meal.

Sushi Cafe is right about next to Henry's American Grill. It's a small little shop, but is bright, clean, and very well maintained. It has a modern feel. After being explained the concept, I was intrigued.

This place is going for the fast, casual eatery. They are going for various boxes which include meats, seafood, and other items. They are also going for a different style of food where they are pairing some Asian ingredients with panini's. You can also order nigiri and sushi rolls by themselves. I ordered a monster box, which included a roll, and 4pcs of nigiri.

I ordered the Korean BBQ roll box which came with 4pcs of nigiri. I thought it was alright. Nothing stood out in bad way. It was a quick casual meal and how I thought would be expected. It was a decent meal.

Originally, I was going to give the food here 3.5 stars, but I rounded up with the really great service and value for what I received. Definitely different when it comes to their contemporaries like Zupas and Panera, but different in a good way."}

They definitely need to have more Asian food around this area and the popularity of Sushi Cafe is a good indicator of that.

I have tried the shrimp monster combo, bulgolgi combo, and the poke bowl (I almost spelled Pokeball instead...but there is a Pokestop nearby so farm away while waiting/eating!). 

Shrimp monster combo is my go to for takeout whenever I am craving for some sushi. For about $11, you get 5 pieces of nigiri, a croquette, and a shrimp tempura california roll style burrito. It is a bunch of food which can easily be enough for 2 meals. I highly recommend trying this if you don't know what you want lol. I did notice that the veggies they use in the burrito does vary at times (a low point was when they gave me a bunch of iceberg lettuce) so just be aware of that. 

The bulgolgi combo is pretty good as well. It comes with bulgolgi (duh), rice, seaweed salad, a croquette, and pickled onions(?). I decided to get this set since I wanted to try something besides the sushi and I wasn't disappointed. The only thing is that the meat portion seems small compared to how much rice you get. Also, the seaweed salad didn't taste as fresh as other places I have been to, but it isn't too bad. 

I got the Poke bowl here since I never had one, and figured it would be appropriate to try it here. You do get a ton of fish and can choose from veggies or salad. I opted for the salad option since I wanted a healthier option. The only gripe I have about this dish is they really drenched it with a lot of sauce. There was a bunch of flavor, but I got kinda sick halfway through my meal since my dish was literally swimming in the sauce lol...I'm not sure if it is like this in other places so I will have to update this post once I get more experience with this dish. 

This is a must try place if you are in the area!"}

I walked in, looked at menu then ordered.  This was the longest part of the process - choosing what to get.  Once I ordered and paid for the spicy tuna roll, california roll and bulgogi box it was five minutes or less before my order was ready.

I took the sushi back to the hotel where my son and husband devoured it.  The review of the spicy tuna was that it was delicious and actually spicy.  (Too many times at other places 'spicy' tuna rolls are anything but spicy.)  The california roll was devoured without a word - so that's a plus, because it was a very picky eater eating it.

My only negative is that I had some fatty meat in the bulgogi box.  Granted, bulgogi will have fatty pieces, but there was one piece that I actually couldn't eat.  It wasn't bad enough to drop the star rating down to four, but thought I'd mention it. 

Overall, everything was delicious, fresh and ready fast!  When a restaurant is as clean as Sushi Cafe, it gives a person confidence that the food prep area is kept clean.

If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely come back again.

*Side note* For a taste of something unique, try the Korean Nongshim (brand) shrimp crackers in the front.  These are hugely popular in Korea.  For me, I think they're nasty, but I don't like shrimp. ;)  (They're actually like chips and not crackers in the US traditional sense.)"}

She clearly explained everything to us and was very responsive. She had excellent suggestions and make sure we had everything we needed. She gave us a few tips and was very friendly to our kids. In addition the food was truly delicious. The rules are the best. We highly advocate for the  shrimp tempura roll and my absolute diehard favorite which was the Philadelphia roll.   The edamame and the seaweed salad was also delicious.  The Edamame beans were perfect with some delicious kosher sea salt.   

You will not be disappointed.  If your experience will be anything like ours, you'll be very glad you came. We were here at 8 PM and didn't feel rushed even though it was the end of the day.  

The service was fast and delightful.  

All five members of my family rated it as a six out of five stars"}

Options include Poke bowls, Sushi burritos, a variety of Sushi Rolls and Nigiri. The Bento Box options are Bulgogi, Fried Fish, Tempura and more. The straightforward menu is very refreshing."}

I ate here two times, the first time I had the bbq Korean box and a shrimp tempura roll. The first time I ordered a Korean BBQ bento box and it was good, the meat was very tender and had  great sauce . The second time the meat was inedible, their was no sauce and the meat quality was downright horrible. I like to give everyone a chance but this place is going to have to step up if they are going to make it in this transit town. Their menu needs to be more descriptive. I didn't dare order something I had no idea of what it was. Their are too many sushi spots in town to have low quality sushi. The prices are good because your not getting the top quality, I would compare their sushi rolls to supermarkets like Smiths/Albertsons. You need to be consistent to stay in business as a new business, 

Their are plenty of sushi spots in the Valley but most are average. I hope this place gets their act together as far as their quality in meat goes or else they won't make it out here :/"}

If you want sushi or you feel like having beef, chicken, pork or some poke, this brand new quick service restaurant is it! 

Fast/Casual style...so order and pay at the register first.  Eco-friendly...Your orders are nicely presented in portable containers. Perfect go-to lunch spot for the nearby office and city workers who just want grab-n-go service. 

--Food--
Sushi, Meats,Salads, Soups and Green Tea Cheesecake are what is on the menu.

Since I cant have sushi, meat is my option. This first visit, I ordered the "BOX".
You choose your protein (Bulgogi, Korean BBQ, Spicy Pork, Chicken or Poke)
-includes seaweed salad, tamago (sweet egg), goroke(kabocha/pumpkin squash) 
and a mix of brown and white rice.

Plus points for catering to the health conscious crowd. The meats are not sodium heavy, and marinated in lighter sauces. 

The goroke is awesome! Reminds me of a croquette but Japanese style with healthy pumpkin squash, covered in panko crust and pan fried....yumm!! And Chef said you can order them off the appetizer section too! 

The tamago egg was surprisingly light too. Seaweed salad and rice were also seasoned nicely. My whole meal was pretty light but filling and  delish!

--Ambiance--
Small and informal restaurant, like cafes are supposed to be. 
You can dine in and chill at the sushi counter or at the tables along the wall. 
The transformation from the previous cheesesteak place is a huge improvement!  Lots of sweat equity went into this place. The tables were made and set up by the owner and chefs themselves. They even put in flooring and new paneling on the walls.  I've seen this place go thru 3 different changes, and this one is one of the nicest change.

Friendly, down-to-earth guys! They were so nice to take time out to answer questions about their menu and culinary background(I know, I'm so nosy). 20+ years classically trained French and Sushi chefs, worked from the ground up.  They know their stuff. I can't wait to try the specials they feature. Looking forward to that French Onion soup too.  

--Location--
Stephanie/American Pacific Parkway - Yup, close by the DMV...Your visual cue is the Auto Zone on Stephanie, restaurant is on the same end as Henry's and Roberto's.

--Summary--
Casual, quick, healthier choices, pretty good food, reasonable prices, eco-friendly, I'd say is a winning concept. More visits in the future, especially since they are open late!"}

Fun Asian box lunches and various sushi rolls in a fast-casual atmosphere. The food is fresh and fairly light, and I especially like how the rice is a white-brown combination.

The White Fish box was plenty of food for one, with two planks of fried fish on a bed of cabbage, with the rice and sides of seaweed salad, pickled veggies, tamago and some sort of sweet potato croquette? I liked everything enough to grab a takeout lemon roll for my guy, who inhaled it and assured me the fish was fresh.

Good addition to the area, focusing on fast lunch should make them a hit with the nearby office parks or for those visiting the nearby DMV. Props for giving this area another healthy option!"}

Since I left DFW I've been trying to find somewhere to fill the void Sushi Robata left in my soul. Sushi Cafe comes damn close. 

The prices are the best I've seen pretty much ever, I think. The menu isn't huge, but it covers the bases. ALSO IMO KOROKKE. It's so hard to find anywhere that does korokke at all, much less somewhere that does them... better than Robata?! The potatoes are so buttery and smooth, and the panko is done well too. The korokke comes with a mysterious orange sauce here, no idea what it's called. It's like a spicy mayo but with a little more heft to it. 

I got the crunch shrimp tempura roll and the red dragon roll. My only criticism is that the eel sauce on the red dragon roll was a little heavy handed, but not a big deal at all. It did leak over into my tempura roll, but whatever. 

They also have some desserts in a fridge case - matcha cheesecake and castella cake, which is basically a sponge cake. The castella is packaged in two slices of slightly different appearance, and I'm not sure of the difference. There's also some instant ramen bowls available, like Shin Bowl, and the odd matcha Pocky and Hi-Chew sorts of snacks. 

Another reviewer mentioned getting ill after having their order delivered. I noticed at the end of my tempura roll, after it had cooled down a bit, that something did taste a little iffy with the room-temperature tempura combined with the eel sauce. If you're getting delivery (and this applies to any sushi place in my opinion), make sure all the sauces are on the side, and don't get anything meant to be eaten piping hot. The korokke might be okay since potatoes hold heat well, but I'd keep the sushi to the cold-only variations."}

Next, I took a bite of my masago sushi... and I can't remember the last time I spit out my food, but immediately I gagged and spit it out. The eggs had gone rancid. Part of me wants to go back and ask for a refund, but instead I'll show my disdain by not going back. And hoping what I did eat doesn't come back up.  So sad... it used to be so good!

Last weekend, after arriving in town, I learned my brother was also in Vegas for a friend's wedding. We decided to meet near where he was staying, which is how we all ended up at the Sushi Cafe in Henderson. Naturally, he previewed the restaurant and noticed it had really good reviews. Considering he lives in San Francisco and loves sushi, this was all the convincing I needed.

The Sushi Cafe is in an interesting location in a strip mall, and it's nicely decorated. Right away, our group felt very comfortable in a clean, modern dining room that was nearly half full. Our server was very kind and took the time to answer our questions. I regret that I don't remember her name.

Most of those in our group chose either the Bulgogi or Spicy Pork boxes. My brother took his own road and selected the Dragon Roll and Edamame. Everyone present enjoyed their meals. And my verdict is this: These are the BEST pot stickers I have ever tried, anywhere!

The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm getting off the freeway at the Stephanie Street exit. Thank you!"}

We ordered to go last night.  I ordered the Monster BBQ box and  hubby ordered the sashimi salad.

My BBQ BOX
-The calbi rolls were not good.  The meet was so chewy, that instead of wasting it, I gave it to Dolce, my adorable doggie.  She seems to love it, unfortunately, I am the one writing the review.
-The 4 piece nigiri are: shrimp, tuna, salmon, and another piece of I don't remember as they were all not good grade as they were chewy as well.  Didn't give this to Dolce as I don't know how she will react to this.
-The potato croquettes were yummy though.
-Seaweed salad - decent

Hubby's Sashimi Salad - not the traditional slices of sashimi you would find at other Sushi restaurant...they just topped the greens with poke style sashimi.  We didn't dig it very much.

Conclusion:  Fast take out place, but we will not be ordering from here again."}

They are a smaller establishment but the quality is very high! Their sushi is excellent and their other dishes (including poki and sashimi) follow suit. Over the last 8 months they have done some serious remodeling and I am in LOVE! It's not just the scenery it's the service. It's more like a restaurant now, service wise, and the atmosphere is borderline "hipster coffee shop". 12/10 would recommend to a friend!"}

I came in for lunch to give it a try! It's tucked in a plaza so you have to look carefully while driving around the parking lot. 

Upon entering, to the left was a huge chalkboard that listed their box specials, and the cashier gave us a paper menu to look at. 

I decided to go with the Salmon burrito box special. I am pretty picky about what I like and don't like to eat, and I specified that I would like to have half salmon and half tuna, with crab mix, spicy mayo, and eel sauce. She told me that all of that would be added in there. However, when I received my burrito there wasn't any crab mix. 

The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the food is actually pretty good for what you're paying. For $10, I got a sushi burrito (it's probably the size of 3 eggrolls), and 5 pieces of sashimi and 2 gyoza. At first I thought it was an okay deal, but it turned out to be more than filling!

Knocking off one star for customer service because it took us over 20 minutes to get our food (most likely because of deep frying the gyoza), and the lack of explanation of the menu. But overall I would come back here for lunch when I am craving sushi. I'll just remember to call it in"}

It came with seaweed salad, sweet fried potatoes pieces, white fluffy rice, pickled garlic and what not and all for under $10.  

The sushi rolls, were not so good here for me.  I had the spicy tuna roll and was it an overload of sodium.  I guess they haven't gotten the mixture of spiciness against the salt ratio down pack. It was major turn off, so it made the rest of my perception of this place go from oh I can totally do this drive for this food to never mind.  I can't imagine what their poke would taste like if they can't even mix spicy tuna.  The up side to it all, the fish is good and the price is probably a pretty good price point.  The sushi rolls weren't good at all, but the nigiri such hamachi, tuna and salmon weren't bad for $2.95 a set.  

For me, the box all the way if I would come back for a 3rd visit."}

We chose to dine in at a time that wasn't busy, specifically to avoid the rush and go when it wouldn't be stressful for the staff. We were literally the only people there and the waitress STILL pressured us to choose what we wanted as soon as we sat down. She made it even worse, because when we said we needed a minute to decide she rolled her eyes at us. We just stood up and left after that. It was ridiculous. I don't know if that person was filling in for someone, or having a bad day, but we never prompted that kind of rude behavior. I will never go here again, because it was an awful experience. Learn some common courtesy and manners."}

A casual place to get Asian food (mainly Japanese and Korean food) or a quick to go meal. Sometimes you just have want a sushi roll or two without committing to AYCE. I got the box with the Korean BBQ, which was marinated sliced beef. It came with some pretty good sides like seaweed salad, egg, and goroke (a croquette made with some kabocha squash and potato). The sushi is legit here, it's fresh and tasty. My favorites are the lemon roll and jackpot roll. Customer service is very friendly and the owners took time to chat and get feedback, which is always a nice touch. There are even snacks to go like instant ramen bowls, rice balls, and some candy.

The staff was friendly and very attentive. The ambiance definitely leaned more towards a cafe than a sushi restaurant - there was no refrigerated display case on the counter containing the usual rainbow of sashimi. But overall, it was a new and unique take on the sushi experience. I look forward to future visits."}

I am literally 5 minutes away from this place and could not be more happy about it opening. It's a fast/casual sushi restaurant which is a nice sight to see in the LV sea of AYCE sushi joints. 

I've been here several times since Celina C. recommended it to me and I'm sure I will be back to satisfy that sushi craving that many of us get. I've gotten the Monster Box w/ kalbi roll, 5 pieces of nigiri, seaweed salad and potato croquette for ~$10. It's a pretty solid deal with a good amount of food. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the fish on the nigiri. It was pretty good and fresh. Was it the BEST sushi I've ever tasted? No, but it's excellent value for what it is. I will have to come in again soon to try the POKE (They spell in 'poki' and it bothers me to no end. Us Hawaii folk know what's up, right?)

There is tons of parking in front of the restaurant and a good amount of seating inside the restaurant as well. I'm hoping this place picks up in business and sustains itself."}

Since I was on this side of town, I decided to stop by with my best friend. We came in around 6:45/7? On a Thursday night. It wasn't packed, probably 2 tables occupied. 

Their menu doesn't have a lot but I consider that a good thing. I opted for the tempura box & we shared a jackpot roll. She ordered the Korean BBQ box. I didn't expect to see a lot of food in the box that I ordered but, to my surprise, it came with other stuff besides the tempura & rice! It also had tamago, gyoza, seaweed salad, and pickled something. I didn't try the pickled thing but everything in my box was amazing. The tempura was plentiful and definitely wasn't too heavy. I wish they put furikake on the rice (maybe I'll ask for that next time). I tried her Korean BBQ & it was alright, nothing spectacular. The jackpot roll was really good! It had a little kick to it. 

Service was great! The server made sure our waters were always filled and asked us how everything was frequently. There are many Japanese/sushi places next to me so idk if I'd go all the way to the other side of town, but I'll definitely stop by if I'm around the area!"}

I got a spicy tuna roll and 1 order each of salmon and yellowtail sashimi. The pricing is amazing for what you get. My sashimi cuts were generous, and only $4.95 for 4 slices of the salmon sashimi, and another $4.95 for 4 slices of the yellowtail sashimi. I'm really particular about spicy tuna and there's was pretty good. If you're looking for a fancy or super swanky sushi place, this isn't it, but if you enjoy sushi, sashimi, poke, and other items at a very reasonable price for what you get with a very laid back environment, this is for you. They will do free delivery if it's with a 3 mile radius with a $30 purchase, and are also available for delivery with some other delivery services. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The gentleman who took my order and rung me up was polite and kind when I asked for extra radish, he asked if I wanted a water cup since I didn't order a drink, and even came over to check on me later to make sure I had gotten enough radish. Fish quality was very good and very fresh, I'm still shocked at how inexpensive my sashimi was for such generous slices. I'm also very picky about sushi and quality, and while some of their rolls do have imitation crab, which I don't eat as it makes me ill, there is plenty of fresh selection and the prices can't be beat. I've been eating sushi since I was 6 and this will definitely be a great stop for me. I will definitely have this as a go to for when I just want a quick roll or two, I definitely can't say enough good things about this place."}

Unexpected extra offerings everywhere.  I like mashups in songs and comic books when done correctly.  I was hopeful on my first visit on a Saturday afternoon at 12 PMish.  

Service: 3/5 They had only 3 employees total working this visit.  It appeared to be one manager, one Chef/Server and one hostess/server all trying to take care of a pretty busy lunch crowd.  They did their best but I had to ask for a refill and took awhile to find someone to get the check.  They were very friendly and they're 1 FTE from a smooth running place on this visit

Food: 4/5 Pleasantly surprised with variety of offerings.  I'm on this Bento Box trip so I went the Bulgogi Box which came with: rice, seaweed salad, tamago and gyoza.  Bulgogi was very tasty and everything else was up to par.  I noticed that you can order 2 pieces of Nigiri and fired away with the: yellowtail, Smelt Egg and the White Tuna.  Great quality for the p.rice which is coming up.

Value: 5/5 Bulgogi Box was $9.95 of amazing value.  Going to be doing a tour of all the boxes they offer on my next visits.  The Nigiri was $2.95 for 2 pieces which worked out perfectly as it allowed me to pick and choose and keep things relatively cheap while getting relatively full.  I'm looking forward to trying the Monster Box which is a Sushit Burrito with 5 pieces of Nigiri for $9.95.

Ambiance: 3.5 The tables seem to be made from some kind of old gate door with multiple planks of wood? Looks cool, but makes the table uneven.  No biggie.  Plenty of seating but this might be one of those places where I'll be ordering for pickup vs eating in.

Summary: A one stop place for Bento Boxes, Sushi (Nigiri and Rolls), Poki, and Sushi Burritos.  The offerings are extra af and I'm stoked to find this place.  I'll keep updating reviews as I keep trying new things. Good times coming. =)"}

The staff there are very nice.  The only complaint I have is half of the time they are close during their trading hours.   I tried calling them in several of occasion to place an order and they never answer their phone. It's been a very inconvenience for us making trip to the restaurant to find out they are close.  I would give them a five star if they operate accordingly."}

I was confused when I walked in because there were no signs to either sit at a table, wait for a table, or order at the counter. We were finally seated at one of the few tables.

The menu was very very small. The prices were reasonable. The sushi was ok.

If you are looking for a quick lunch or delivery this place will do, but don't come here for a nice dinner."}

With so many business around we needed a quick sushi fix in the neighborhood. Saw my Niece post a review about this and was shocked! I never heard of it...I never even knew it existed. Raved about it all last week to my coworkers and we finally went there for lunch today. I couldn't be more satisfied! We got the monster roll box. Different types and all were delicious! For $10.77, you get your money worth and it's excellent sushi I may add. Fish was fresh! Monster box came with a monster sushi (sushi burrito), 5 piece of sushi (diff fish) and two fried mashed potato tempura (don't know the name) but that was good. It's mash potato and mashed sweet potato deep fried! HEAVEN! Staff was nice and friendly. Answered all our questions. Place was spacious and clean. Prices are more than affordable! This is a must try place. Only two downfall was it was hot inside. They had a big fan blowing but not sure if the AC was not fully working or what. Also, I would recommend to add more spicy mayo. We had 3 different monster rolls (sushi burritos) and all lacked spicy mayo but still amazing flavors."}

Basic rolls $4.95, very reasonable appetizers, bento boxes & specialty rolls. Management (possibly owner) was very hands on & checked that my order was to my liking. Efficient but not over bearing. 

I would have preferred the food not be served in to go boxes, if it's not to go. And the only other negative, for me, was I had water & it was served in a very small cup (almost like a child's drink) 
I would be glad to pay for water & have a normal, 12 or 16 oz cup. 

But those are minor flaws & I will definitely return. This is a place I will probably regularly patronize. Highly recommend."}

While I have never actually tasted the fish, I have had their veggie rolls and custom vegan rolls they make for me. Those have all been delicious! 
Also, the price is really fair, sometimes when you customize an order it can be up charged quite a bit. That is not the case here at sushi Café, as they charge me about five dollars for a custom vegan sushi roll. 
I've had the edamame a few times as well, & it always comes out warm and with a good amount of salt on it. Yum!
Their tea is also good. 
I like the way the seating is with the couches in the front for a relaxed ambiance. This is a very casual place so don't expect it to be trendy or high-end overpriced sushi. 
If you'd like a quick food stop with quick service and reasonable prices, then you should definitely check this place out."}

I really didn't expect much, so I was thrilled at how luscious my lunch - got the Monster Box  - was. Actually, there was only one glitch: almost too much food! (How bad can that be, right?) Strangely (or not so strangely) I was able - or should I say willing - to get it all down and I was happily stuffed as I left the restaurant. Of course, sushi being sushi, it was all good. It's a healthy way to fill up. Just wonderful. Don't miss out on this one. Let's make it a super popular spot so that it will stay with us for a long time. Thanks for the great meal!

I was craving for some sushi burrito and/or Korean fried chicken and since I am on a lunch break and this is the closest place to go I decided to come here. Walked in and went straight to the counter and I was given the menu expecting to order their lunch menu sushiritto and 5 (?) sushi combo. Apparently they no longer have this so I was a little disappointed. I asked if they have the KFC as well but they did not have it. 

I opted to order the bulgogi plate (~$10+) to go thinking that it would be tiny based on other people's photos. Opening it back in the office I was greeted by a cup of rice, seaweed salad, tamago , some dumplings and the bulgogi.

Rice was done well, seaweed was not too dry or salty, but I wish I didn't get the cucumbers under it, the tamago was sweet, but dumplings was alright. The bulgogi though... I've had better. It wasn't badddd per se but it was just...bulgogi. What I usually see people get wrong is that the meat gets really hard and dry but Sushi Cafe didn't have that. The juices also seeps down and kind of mix in with the rice which I have no complaints about. I would suggest less... purple cabbage(?) as it had a very bitter taste to it... but that's just me. Kimchi would be nice toooo!

All in all, I think I loved the seaweed the most. Will definitely need to try out the sushiritto later though."}

The rolls and all are really good. My daughter and I would visit here 2-3 times a week. We even stayed loyal during their unfortunate closing and reopening. The superwhite is what brought us here the most. Then the superwhite was suddenly not available. And now I'm told they won't care it any longer. The price is average and the rolls are comparable to other places in the area. Unfortunately the superwhite is the game breaker. We live around the corner from here so we might stop in once a month or so. Sorry but if it's a more expensive fish then charge accordingly. Patrons like myself will happily pay."}

The menu was small and simple, and everything was priced fairly well! We ordered one bulgogi box, a lemon roll, a red dragon roll, a tiger roll and a caterpillar roll for under $50.

I've never not wanted to post a picture of my sushi, but this was a first. The fried tempura rolls were equally awful and overly thick. The nigiri squid and octopus sushi was still partially frozen when it was served. The best thing about this restaurant was the green tea and that was still served to me in the can with a straw. Bathroom was disgusting and the place just felt filthy overall. Stained seats and tables cluttered with dishes long after patrons had left. I'm from Hawaii and have had sushi in Japan, California, as well as many other states and countries and this place was by far the worst. I was lured here by the solid 4.5 star reviews and am now convinced that the people of Henderson, Nevada will never know or taste good sushi and the quality of service and cleanliness that the Japanese are known for. Never again!"}

Yes. It was that good. It was some of the best poke I have had in Vegas. They don't smother the fish in sea salt and oil like some places do. You can actually taste the fish. They also fried us some tofu, which was not on the menu. That was nice of them. The yellowtail hand roll and the dragon roll were also excellent.

The kitchen and dining area were very clean. The staff was very friendly. It was definitely worth the drive from Summerlin. I recommend that you stop in and have some poke or whatever else you care to try. I will be back!!"}

I like to get the monster box with a tuna monster roll. It also comes with 5 pieces of nigeri (tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail and white fish). All of that for $10! It's a great deal and the fish is pretty good- not the best but what do you expect for $10?? The monster box used to be better though too.. it used to come with the fried potato which is delicious..

This is perfect for your time constrained lunches or if you're too hungry and don't want to sit in a restaurant and wait.

I've ordered take out three times. Once through Eat24 and the other two times, I called in. I tried to get there before my order was finished the last time I called and I couldn't beat them. The quality wasn't sacrificed despite the speed with neatly made rolls and fresh fish with every order. I usually get the poke or a box and the rest of the family will split a bunch of basic rolls. The boxes have plenty of food which include rice, egg, seaweed salad, and korroke (potato croquette).The food has been good every time with the only slip up being the rice being too wet and mushy with one order. But in the end, you'll be pleased with the amount of food you get for the price you pay.

There can be a little bit of a language barrier if you call in your order. There's plenty of seating if you decide to eat there. The restaurant is clean with an open kitchen. And all of the guys working there are super friendly. They repeat the order completely before you leave and they had no issue abiding by my request for extra ginger after the order was finished. I didn't have the bow count meter on when I last stopped in, but I think I hit about 6 bows to the fine gentleman at the register when I last picked up my order."}

He threw up several more times that night and my husband had REALLY bad burps and is still dealing with terrible runs today that are making him miserable. Even though I only ate one I'm also having issues with nausea and the runs.

So I originally gave a one star review based on us getting some food poisoning from one of our rolls, but I'm updating it based on the great customer service we received when we let them know. One of the owner's came to our place to personally refund us money and explain the situation as well as invite us to come in and try them again with a free meal. We will take advantage of this based on the issue being a delivery one and the many good reviews they have as well as the good customer service."}

Also it would have been nice to have more choice of sashimi instead of 1 type of fish for the 6 pieces. And also I would go somewhere else if you like variety bc their menu is pretty small. The squid I got for sashimi was poor quality"}

And worst part is when the Yellowtail came, it was just hard as rocks because they were frozen. Disappointing!"}

Food: 5

*** All boxes come with seaweed salad, sliced cucumbers, rice, and 2 beef gyozas.

Fried Fish Box: The box comes with a big fish fillet covered in thick, crisp batter. Th fish itself is moist. There's an additional mixed spring salad along with the other items in a normal box.

Bulgogi Box: The beef is sautéed with onions. The beef was surprisingly tender despite seemingly lean. The sauce was slightly sweet, but it paired well with the seaweed salad and cucumbers.

Shrimp Tempura Roll: This was a standard roll with shrimp tempura, avocados, and cucumber. I loved the tempura flakes that covered the top of the roll. It was rolled a tad looser than I would like.

Service: 5

Our waitress was the owner's daughter. She was nice and pretty professional. The food did take a bit of time to come out (~15 mins), but it was clear that the food was made to order because it all comes out piping hot.

Ambiance: 4.5

The cafe is small and cute. There's a lot of interesting little decorations. I also like that you can see them making some of the food. My only gripe is that the bathroom is a little run down and jarringly different from the rest of the cafe."}

Ordered delivery two nights in a row, that's how good it is. Now, I know the place is called Sushi Cafe, but I ordered it for the Korean nom-noms. I LOVE Korean food and this place has some really good Korean-style meats that you can get delivered which is awesome. There's no other place for this kind of food around here that delivers (I'm looking at YOU Jun's!). I had the fried philly-roll and it was good, but not really what I was excited about anyway. i really love dwaeji bulgogi so when I saw the spicy pork box, I knew I would like it and I did. It was le-noms.
Another thing that they have that's really good is the Korean style fried chicken. Of you are a fan of Korean fried chicken places like Kyochon, you should def try the fried chicken here. It's tasty! I highly recommend this place especially if you want Korean food without leaving the house!"}

What's up with the service in this town lately? This is yet ANOTHER one of my go-to's that has fallen from its ranks. 
The last two times I've been here the usual lady that takes my order has been in the back sleeping -and the wait staff doesn't speak English. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem, but if you have any questions or ask any specific things...there's a language barrier. Very frustrating when you're hungry and the guy keeps smiling and nodding but has no clue what you're asking. 
Last time they put mixed greens that were warm and wilted in my sushi...gross. 
This time they ended up waking the lady in the back room and we were able to order. But three things still came out wrong!! One thing was never brought out. And yet they did nothing to fix it nor adjust the bill. 
Not a good experience at all. Won't be coming here again."}

We ordered and waited a very short time for our food. The sushi was hand rolled and organically cut so the pieces were bigger than we were accustomed to, but in the best way possible. We got a little of everything to try, and we're not let down. The fish was fresh, the presentation was beautiful, and the price was very fair and comparable to other sushi spots nearby, but you get way more bang for your buck here. 

I would definitely urge you to stop in! It's an absolutely worthwhile place to try."}

It's in a shopping plaza and is very clean. We ordered the tempura philly roll, spicy crawfish, another roll that I can't remember, and the egg rolls. 

First off, everything was cooked to order and tasted super fresh! The sushi came in like 8 slices per roll- so much food. I really enjoyed my Philly and hubby lived both his rolls, but he REALLY loved the spicy crawfish. 

Not only was the sushi really great, but the prices were so reasonable!! I mean we're used to paying $13+ for a basic 6 piece roll in LA Our total bill came out to $36 and we had leftovers.... WINNING!!!

The woman who worked here (assuming the owner?) was super sweet and attentive, but not in an annoying way. I can't wait to move to Henderson in the next month and a half, because this will def be our go to sushi spot!!"}

About a year ago, a Monster Box was a Sushi burrito, 4 pieces of Nigiri, and 2 potstickers for $9.99.. Fast forward to about 6 months ago, and the sushi burrito was $9.99 alone, with the Monster box coming in at $13 or so. That's cool. Inflation. I come in 2 weeks ago, and asked for the Monster Box. The lady who's ALWAYS at the register (more on her later), said they don't have that anymore, but she'll "hook me up with it as a special." She rang me up. Came to over $16. She just charged me regular prices for all 3 items. That THREE price changes in less than a year. Not cool. Not consistent.

Back to the lady. I understand she has to sell people on their product but she's literally borderline harassing. Twice in the past few months, me and my ex visited and she pushes and pushes and pushes their special rolls. Even after you tell her no, not interested, she walks by asking, "Are you sure?" ...and even walked someone else's special roll past us to show us. We finally ordered it to shut her up. It was AMAZING! ..but that's besides the point. I eat sushi all over the country. Never am I pressured EVERY time I go. Even when ordering the Monster Box to go, she tries to get you to get the special. It's really annoying.

Will I be back? Yep. I'm leaving here right now actually. Would I come a lot more if they had consistent pricing and the lady at front had a muzzle? Absolutely.

Also: Call ahead. Twice in the past year, they were closed without notice, even though Store Hours sign said open.."}

We ended up switching our main dishes ourselves because we like each other's better. I love the scrambled egg and the avocado the most. What is interesting is that the famous coffee cake in this restaurant isn't really a coffee cake as it doesn't have coffee flavor.

Coffee was $2.65 - and was pretty bad. In part, I didn't discover until my second cup. The "creamers" on the table are actually "non-dairy" in disguise!

So, if you want real milk or cream -you have to ask for it (which they don't tell you!!)

What upset me the most was my waffle. It was a good waffle and their syrup decent - however, for $7 for just a small round waffle (no, no extras just the waffle).

You would think the large cup of what looked like whipped butter would be perfect.

Unfortunately, you'd be wrong. It was a large cup of whipped ... fake something. I'm thinking canola oil but not sure - I am 100% sure it was not in any way butter!

When I nicely mentioned it at check out after spending $25 on breakfast - I got two smirks with a promise they'd pass it on.

So, I'm not the only one that's commented on it. New management needed before you go bust.

So many other places to go for breakfast for a fraction of the price."}

The glaring failure with this place is their absolute inability to correctly put together a to go order.  I say inability, because there can't be any other explanation for their 100% failure rate. I can only assume that there is some kind of medical condition plaguing the staff that prohibits them from grasping the concept of checking an order before they hand it off. 

I work in an office across from this place, and I have literally had this problem dozens of times.

First: If you come here on a weekend, expect a wait time. My husband and I had to wait 10 minutes for a seat, which honestly isn't terrible...but still meh. There are cool little stores nearby to kill a few minutes in.

Service: The service was good. That was one thing I enjoyed about the place. Our server was ready to recommend items and substitutes for entrees at the drop of a hat. In fact we saved a little money from it. BONUS!

Price: This area made me sad. You get a lot of food, yes, but everything was overpriced. I got a Joes scramble which was about 10 dollars. I could have made it at home for a fraction of the price. Their coffee is 2.25 for a cup. OUCH. I'm used to being kind of tight with my money, so everything on the menu made my wallet cry. Especially since you can make a lot of it at home.

Quality: The quality of the food was good. On par to what you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. The portions are good and everything is well cooked. The eggs are fluffy and the potatoes weren't overcooked. 

Overall: It was a decent experience but once was more then enough for me. There are other places to go for a good breakfast and that cost half as much. I suggest going there once to try it and judge yourself."}

It's been in my to-do list on my phone for a while now, pulled from some Yelp list that hasn't really brought me any real treats yet. Most people's recommendations and opinions for food are typically below my expectations, but someone has to come through right? Looks like I might have to keep going on that list.

The Cracked Egg is in a typical local strip mall and blends in with everything else from the outside like the rest of our mundane suburban locations. The inside is very open, pretty loud and not that fancy. Some breakfast themed restaurants have a slightly cozier feel than this, but in no means is it uninviting or that bad.

This restaurant is really a breakfast place, and the menu reflects that all the way; you have the full gamut of breakfast choices but I'm sure way better than anything you'd find at an IHOP. The burger options make up a very small section of the menu, with only a few choices that seem like typical offerings for a menu like this.

I went with a mushroom and Swiss burger to once again sample a baseline offering, as they don't really give you the option for a stand-out feature burger. What you're given is a pretty standard looking plate with a good sized burger, pickle wedge, lots of onion, a very large piece of lettuce and some oddly seasoned fries. The seemingly pre-made (not hand-made) patty was thin, yet juicy. It had ok flavor, but wasn't really cooked medium as I had asked. The bun was a bit thin, and made me nervous based on how juicy the burger was, but still held up through to the end. The mushrooms and Swiss both had good flavor and were welcome toppings, whereas my giant hunk of lettuce was a bit much.

As I said before, the fries had an odd seasoning on them I can't quite place. They were just ok, not that fresh and not too crispy. Overall the meal was just ok, depending on how much of a factor you consider the fries to be I don't have too much to complain about, but it just wasn't that great overall. At $8.95 it's not a horrible price, but I've had far better from some other less-than-fancy places lately that were even cheaper. If you're a breakfast lover I'm sure you couldn't go wrong here, but if you're looking for a good cheap burger in Henderson, there are much better places."}

We chose the seasoned potatoes, the hash brown, and the coffee cake to go with our food.  The coffee cake was warm and moist, with cherries at the bottom.  Tasted delicious with the coffee.  For the hash brown, I asked for it extra crispy, but didn't come out to how I would like it to be.

Rainbow as well). Attentive and friendly service. If with a regular customer, the waitstaff pretty much already knows what they want. Food arrives in a timely manner.

Overall, everything I've ordered has been tasty. Large portions. The spicier dishes (eg. anything with chorizo and or green chile) are too mild for my tastes, but like that there is the option to have something with some non-Anglo flair. The coffee cake I had as my "toast" option on this past visit was a bit of a disappointment: taste and consistency of something that came out of a Betty Crocker box.

Nice breakfast place. And if you go on a regular basis, don't forget to sign-up for their loyalty program to get discounts on future meals."}

Took a quick glance.  Yup...we were the only Asian people there.  But that didn't stop me from trying to get my scrambled eggs, nor did the long wait and freezing weather outside.  Starting my morning with some coffee cake?  Count me in!  Starved and fatigue since the night before, this sweet beginning couldn't have come at a better time.  

I knew I wanted some scrambled eggs but my rational mind opted for an omelette with vegetables, the Garden Patch.  It was a wrong choice as I was eyeing my friend's scrambled eggs the whole time.  Luckily I got to steal some and heavenly fluffy it was.  Don't get me wrong.  The Garden Patch omelette would have been a great hit if I were a rabbit.  Note to self - never put broccoli in an omelette.  Go for the hashbrown if you can.  If you get lucky, they'll brown it thoroughly and what you get will be a crunchy shreddy and starchy texture to play with in your mouth.  Definitely one of the funnest moments in my mouth."}

I always come in, and leave feeling like I was friendlier than them. They never have a smile or a nice greeting for take out orders. Also I personally work at the front of my work and do a better job greeting and asking people how they are once in awhile other than feeling like I'm at a morgue.

It just seemed like the staff did not want to be there. They have no pride in their restaurant either. There's trash on the floor and I watched the staff walk by it multiple times including the busser and no one seemed to care to pick it up. Additionally, our server seemed disinterested. She was not very genuine with her service. Made it a horrible experience especially when we are paying good money to buy cheap food. Pretty sure their food cost for French Toast is like 1 dollar and they charged it up to about 10 dollars. I gave it a two star because the food was OK."}

There was a small wait for a table because the place was BUSY!. Despite the reviews to the contrary, the staff was pleasant and attentive, without hovering. They asked if we wanted anything else before bringing the check and offered refills when our drinks were just less than half empty. 
My friend ordered the Eggs Benny, which she said was good. The hash browns looked and were uncooked, but they were not greasy, so trade off. The eggs could have used slightly more hollandaise sauce, but our server was happy to bring more when asked. 
I ordered the Monte Cristo on the servers rec. I was considering the Eggs benny also. It was good but nothing to write about, truly. I would have liked the option being offered, on menu, of jam or syrup. I choose the seasoned potatoes. They were so NOT seasoned. They were barely salted, but hey, not too greasy also. They were also not too crunchy or crispy, lol. But I did eat them, so they were tasty after adding salt and pepper. They just were not what I expected to receive based on the word "Seasoned" 
Overall, I will go back and try other menu items. It was clean, the staff was pleasant and efficient, the food tasted good. The prices were reasonable. It is not close to my home, but for those in the area, check this place out if you haven't already.  Why wouldn't you?"}

Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.  So I figured taking it in on a Sunday, at least I would be able to use the original amount towards my meal.  The server curtly told me that they would not accept it.  When I asked to see a manager, she came over with an attitude and refused to acknowledge my explanation or even listen to anything I wanted to say.  She kept repeating we will not take it.  I felt that she was incredibly rude and will unfortunately not return to this location because of her.  It is really unfortunate for me, because the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've eaten.  But I refuse to go to a restaurant where the management will not even listen to what I have to say.  I also feel that it would not have effected the store if she would have honored the original groupon price.  Thank goodness for me I can still go to Egg Works.  They have always treated me with respect and smiles."}

To add to the disappointing meal was the appearance and less than friendly staff. Employees do not have be overly happy but a fake smile would have helped. When we went to pay the bill after leaving a cash tip, the man behind the cash register who was dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt with no employee identifying marks, seemed way to anxious for me to add a tip and even offered to fill in the reciept for me.

My boyfriend and I basically go every Saturday...so with that being said, I was REALLY ASTOUNDED by what happened today...

BUGS IN OUR FOOD. THE FOOD-ON THE PLATE-EVERYWHERE.

My boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast, and I got one of the egg scrambles. All was fine, and then I saw a little brown bug crawling on the side of my boyfriend's plate. I looked closer, and saw literally 5 of them...and then more...I immediately told him to stop eating. We called our server over and she took the plate away. I then decided I couldn't eat because I was so insanely grossed out. The server then brought over our check and charged us for everything except my boyfriend's meal. I DIDN'T EVEN EAT MY MEAL (A FEW BITES) BECAUSE OF HOW DISGUSTED BY THE BUGS I WAS.

The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize or anything. The server just took my boyfriend's meal off the check and that was that. So my boyfriend decided to find the manager. After 5 minutes of searching the small restaurant for her, she came out and seemed ANNOYED to talk to him. She had a smug "don't care" attitude. My boyfriend is wayyyy too nice in my opinion...and the manager said that this is "the food industry and that bugs happen". !!!!!!!!!!!! What!!! management should never ever tell their patrons that. My boyfriend then asked her how she would feel if she had bugs in her food and her reply, "well, i grew up around animals so I wouldn't have cared." !!!!!!! What!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally after the manager made my boyfriend feel like an idiot for "politely" complaining, she said, "ok, if it'll make you happy, i'll take off your girlfriends meal too." That wasn't even it! It was the principle behind everything!!!!!!

I teach service recovery in the hospitality for a living and that was the most piss poor excuse of a manager I have ever encountered.

NEVER EVER going there again. I'm extremely disappointed."}

Where I haven't tried everything I am a big fan of the Veggie Benny. The dish is served on traditional English muffins, topped with tomatoes, poached eggs and avocado, smothered in hollandaise. Yet don't forget the Potatoes, these little squares, seem to be deep fried and seasoned yet not quite to perfection, but all the same they are good. I would say that the hollandaise could be thicker. But as a whole this restaurant has a menu with a wide range of traditional breakfast and lunch favorites. This wham bam breakfast joint, is a nice place to go with family and friends in a very relaxed environment, even appropriate for a quick breakfast or lunch for any business oriented outing. This location is definitely going to give the corporate chop shops, IHOP, Denny's, and the Original Pancake House a worthy competitor in the turf war that is breakfast. Surely The Cracked Egg has more of a local, friendly, and welcoming environment than its corporate competitors as well. Please stop by this restaurant and give it a shot.

Location- It's located right off of the 215 and green valley in the smith's strip mall building. Lots of parking and easy to find.

Ambience- It's clean and simply decorated. Very open with booths and a small counter area to eat at.

Service- Considering we were the only table here I did expect more. Our server was friendly enough and provided efficient service. Can't complain.

Food- We ordered the Monte Cristo w/ hash browns, The Carnitas omelet w/potatoes and blueberry coffee cake, and chocolate pancakes w/ side of bacon. We all shared the coffee cake. It was moist and fresh but we all agreed that the blueberries did not compliment the coffee cake. My son enjoyed his Monte Cristo but said he wouldn't eat it again. My omelet was dry, flat, and tasteless. I did expect so much more. Maybe my food choices wasn't the best, but it was recommended by the server.

I love me some good customer service and she did a really good job.  The host/hostess were cool.  They clowned my GF for accidentally running into this baby, knocking her down, and making her cry.

For the food, the coffee cake was really good.  Careful though, I think they throw it in the microwave to heat it up a bit, so the filling gets a little hot.  Really good though.  My corned beef hash was OK.  Not bad, but not that exciting either.  GF ordered some kind of enchilada omelette that wasn't very good.  It wasn't gross, but it just lacked flavor all around.  It just tasted like egg and cheese, basically.  The potatoes were addicting, though.

Overall, I think I'd give it another shot and order something different.

The coffee cake is very deceiving, very lite like an angels food cake consistncy but it filled me up quickly. I still can't decide whether I liked the coffee cake or not. It was a little too lite and very crumbly to the point I was wondering if it was undercooked but it had a nice taste although a tad sweet.
 Service was eggcelent. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely come back."}

Upon entering this place, I did get more a crowded and intense fast paced feeling rather than a homey breakfast feeling.  The wait for a table was 5-10 mins which I thought was good, considering they were slammed with a bunch of families.  

Once being seated I read the menu thoroughly, just so I would get something I liked rather than something I'd hate.  After a good 5 mins our waitress came out and gave us our drinks, she then returned later to take our order.  I thought that her knowledge about the food was a little less than pleasing.  I asked about the holladaise sauce and she didn't know hot describe it other than it was yellow. Hmmmm, I wasn't too please there so I ordered something I was familiar with. 

Orders were: 

Monte Cristo - Turkey, ham, cheese, and bread dipped in french toast batter and fried to a crisp.  It was very interesting, it came with syrup and 2 sides of either hash browns or seasoned potatoes and eggs.  Although the concept was interesting, I thought it was ok.  It was a weird combination and it did go together, but it's something I probably wouldn't try again.  

Biscuits and Gravy - Biscuits served with gravy, the name says it all.  The biscuits were really soft and the consistency of it with the gravy did compliment each other well. Oddly though, I prefer the biscuits and gravy at South Point's Coronado Cafe.  Now that says a lot, especially since that's not voted Best of Las Vegas.  The gravy was ok, there were meats here in there, but it did taste a little watered down.  

There were a lot of other things that I did want to try, but it didn't seem as interesting.  I'd probably return here cause the service was good, and the seating was fast."}

Peanut Butter French Toast - The bananas on top were over ripe (not something I enjoy), and with the syrup, made this sickeningly sweet."}

I ordered the corned beef hash with two poached eggs, hash browns and coffee cake. The corned beef was fresh and homemade, not that canned stuff and seasoned perfectly with bell peppers and onions. The hash browns were good but nothing out of the ordinary but my mom had the country potatoes and she said they were "really good" with a smile. The coffee cake was also an added bonus and delicious. It came out before our meal and was nice and warm!

My husband ordered an omelette with sausage (can't remember which one) but he devoured it. He also added country gravy, which I initially thought was a little gross but it was actually pretty damn good!

  When my husband and I go to Las Vegas, we try to find food eating "gems" that are NOT on the strip. Last time we were there, my husband had wanted a Monte Cristo, and I read that they served one at the Luxor's Pyramid Cafe. We went and he found out it was actually a "Monte Carlo", not a "Monte Cristo".... (sadness on the part of my husband)...
 
  This time, I did some research and found that there was a small chain called The Cracked Egg. We went to the one in Henderson and.... Bruce was in HEAVEN... 
It was a REAL Monte Cristo The turkey, ham and swiss cheese dipped in a french toast batter and deep fried, (unlike the Monte Carlo, which is just grilled). I ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast, and was very satisfied. Very tasty and real fresh raspberries all over it too.
 
  Not only were the portions huge... (we couldn't finish either order), but it was all perfectly cooked to our liking. I noticed other orders around us, and they also seemed like very generous helpings. The waiter, was very fast, efficient, but still very cordial. 
I liked the fact that is is not just a breakfast house, which includes a "gluten free" menu,  but they have an extensive menu of sandwiches, burgers and salads.
  
  Needless to say, when we visit Las Vegas again, we will definitely go to the Cracked Egg for our breakfast. Maybe try the other ones a bit closer to the middle of town."}

I have a 2lb Chihuahua, which I tuck in my jacket.  
In a nut shell, the waitress let me order, then told the other A***hole, I had my pet in my jacket and had to leave.   I would have left with no problem, but then the a***hole manger started making an issue that I had "broke the law" by bringing my pet with me.    I apologized, however, he followed me to the counter.  and again verbally attacked me.  So I begin to shout out loud.  He wanted the attention!!!.

Anyhow, if you're a pet lover, this place is a zero, the fat waitress is rude, "yeah, you know who you are!!!

The omelet was around $10 and came out very dry, almost inedible if it wasn't for the pounds of melted cheese on top. The veggies on the inside were mushy and indistinguishable. The side of hash browns was okay, as was the toast... but a hefty price to pay for some toast and small side of hash browns. I picked at my omelet, and left over half of it un eaten. My previous visits here were equally unmemorable, but I got to catch up with lovely Jaime W here, so I opted to give this place another shot.

Whether sitting at the counter (no waiting) or in the main dining area (usually a wait), I have consistently experienced good service at the Cracked Egg.  At times it's a little slow, but they get very busy during weekend brunch, so it's hard to find fault with that.

You'll find typical American breakfast and lunch fare here.  Not much that would pique your interest to venture off the beaten path; but sometimes you're just looking for familiar comfort food.  Their omlettes, scrambles, and bennies are all tasty and hearty.  Their burgers are juicy and flavorful, and their salads fresh and cruchy.  Their pancakes are good too, but they're no Dupar's or Babystacks.

The space itself is large and clean, but could really use a decorator's touch.  Side benefit of The Cracked Egg is it's proximity to Popcorn Girl :)."}

It was him, myself, and my 18 month old. I was really excited to try The Cracked Egg as I love trying breakfast places, and I wanted to compare it to some other local places we have been. I wanted to love the experience so much, but I couldn't. I didn't feel that relaxed, comfortable, local feel. As in, the service was below average. I understand places such as here get busy but I worked in the restaurant industry for years so while I can be flexible and understanding I still expect good service. Our server hurried over and asked immediately wanted to order. I asked a couple of questions, we asked recommendations (she did not give us any). I wanted to do a build your own because there were a few extra things I wanted to add to my skillet. She told me just order the corned beef hash skillet off the menu instead of doing build your own (in an annoyed tone) and said it cost less (which it did not, and she said it in an insulting way as if I was trying to jip her or something). I took her recommendation anyways. I love corned beef hash, I order it almost every breakfast place I go but this was not up there compared to some other restaurant's in the areas of quality, taste, and value. I will say the coffee cake was to die for!! I absolutely loved it. The texture, temperature, and flavor was perfect. Our server wasn't seen again the whole meal except to come over and grab our plates (I wasn't done yet) and give us the check. I felt rushed in and out. I just sadly wish our dining experience out on this occasion could have been better. I was disappointed."}

So imagine my excitement when I see Cracked Egg has scrambled egg whites on the menu! With protein and veggies! They customized my egg whites to be grilled chicken + mushrooms at no extra cost. Egg whites came with delish hashbrowns + amazing soft coffee cake. Fiance got a customizable skillet. Love the options to customize that Cracked Egg has!!

The hash browns seemed soaked in grease and weren't very hot (reheated maybe?). The bacon was extra chewy, leading me to believe it was cooked much earlier in the day and ''stored'' until needed.

Bigger portions especially when it comes to the "Big Bad Wolf" omelet would have earned an extra star or two. The omelet itself was stuffed full of meat but was small by all standards (took up less than half my plate and was half an inch thick).  Coffee cake was absolutely delicious so I am glad I read the reviews and knew to order it. Four dollars for orange juice was pretty steep when the entree itself cost ten dollars. Lesson learned though. 

Overall 10$ for a small omelet and 4$ for orange juice leaves me wanting a lot more for the price.  I would go back for the coffee cake but that's really the only thing pulling me back."}

Being a french toast connoisseur it takes a lot to impress me and the Cracked Egg certainly did that.  

I went one morning after 9 am with a friend for a late breakfast and we both wanted something special. That is why we choose to try their stuffed french toast. We looked at all sorts of breakfast places before deciding to come here. All thanks to the menu having something different, stuffed french toast.

My friend ordered the Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast while I had the Raspberry Stuffed French Toast. With these, you better have an appetite. Each come with six slices of stuffed french toast with a side of butter and syrup(which is overkill, the stuffed french toast prepared as is enough). The Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast comes with bananas and, of course peanut butter, although chocolate would also be nice. The Raspberry Stuffed French Toast has a raspberry cream cheese filling with some berries and powder sugar sprinkled on top. If you want anything else, you have to order is as a side but the Stuffed French Toast will have you stuffed all by itself. 

The place was busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes. Our waiter seemed to caught up in what he was doing and wasn't really engaging any of the diners. He wasn't terrible but he just seemed to be doing his job instead of giving good service. Because of that, I feel I can't give them a 5 star rating."}

We came to meet my mom and surprise her, we asked to have one of the several empty tables near my mom's table pulled next to her table and my mom's server refused, "because it wasn't her section." Uh ok, whatever! So my husband and I just sit at a table next to my mom and wait and wait and wait for our server who never comes.
I say to my husband, I think we need to let the hostess know since we just sat here. So I did and apologized for not making her aware of us taking the table and could she get our server. 
The hostess was more than put out but I ignored it. Our server grudgingly showed up, took our order and disappeared, never to be heard from again until our food showed. I had two eggs over medium, they were fine except my food was served on a  warped plastic plate that kept spinning every time I ate off of it.
My husband ordered basic eggs Benedict. The eggs were so under cooked that the whites looked literally like snot. So nasty. He pointed it out to the server and she proceeded to tell him that's how eggs Benedict are served and continued to argue with him even after he told her that was not true.
The manager who came over was quite nice and apologetic and removed the EB from our bill with out hassle.
It took forever to get our bill from the disgruntled server and when we finally did, it appeared that the EB had not been removed. I asked the previously rude hostess who is now our cashier to look into it and she proceeds to tell me that the reason we had such a bad experience was because we had sat ourselves.
Well needless to say at this point, I'm offended beyond reason and I begin to lose it with the hostess. The manager comes again and is very nice again, but he clearly has no control over his staff.
I NOR MY HUSBAND WILL EVER FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! The food is not worth the hassle and it's very over priced. I ended up paying $18 for two eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon,  and coffee. And as someone else that wrote a review stated the entire wait staff starting with the hostess are rude, unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor. Stay away. I had been going there since the place opened and kept having bad experiences, which culminated into my last and final atrocious experience."}

I found myself here for breakfast with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect. This is your run of the mill greasy spoon, common in the country's interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite, for better or worse. They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.

The menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.

This wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.   

I may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh."}

It's your typical sit down breakfast/lunch place with omelets, pancakes, skillets, sandwiches and burgers. The portions are fairly large and the prices are decent. We always have left overs no matter what we order. 

I've tried breakfast and lunch items, but honestly nothing really stands out as "wow I need to order this again." The only thing worth mentioning is their COFFEE CAKE! It's served warm and it's so so soft. The flavor changes daily but my favorite has got to be the strawberry or the pumpkin. Even if I order a burger, I will still order me a side of coffee cake, it's that good. 

The service is hit or miss. I've had servers who looked happy to be there. However, I've also had servers who hated their lives and it showed. On our last visit, our server seemed to be rushing through the motions. No biggie though. The one thing I'm definitely not a fan of is the waiting area. It can get congested really fast. With customers having to go to the register to pay, that just adds to even more congestion.

I'm not in any rush to eat here again. But I wouldn't be opposed for someone suggested this for breakfast."}

I got tomatillo sauce, scallions (not a choice but still got em), and avocado slices.  This combo just works, and it clogs the arteries too, but it is soooooo delicious.  I also tasted Eric R.'s coffee cake that came with his omelette - it was more like dessert but steaming hot, a welcome change from the cold cake slices at Starbucks.

After reading all the reviews about the big portions, I split the croissant sandwich and seasoned potatoes with my mom. It was definitely a knife and fork sandwich especially because I ordered the eggs over easy. There's a reason why you can't get an over easy egg mcmuffin. It was a delicious, cheesy mess.

I particularly loved the seasoned potatoes, which were super crispy. I can just imagine eating a whole plate of them with gravy! The bf also raved about the hash browns, but I think the seasoned potatoes were better. I also had a bite of my dad's coffee cake which was a bit too sweet for me. It looked like a cornbread square and was less dense than the coffee cakes I'm used to.

When we asked for more ketchup she snatched it from us without saying anything and then came back and slammed it on the table.

Great food, but the server could have been friendlier."}

Their coffee was definitely burned, having been left heating at the beverage station they retrieved the carafe. I mentioned this to the waitress who insisted I was crazy. Apparently they are famous for their coffee. She came back with a new mug and the same carafe from the same beverage station as before. The second cup was just as burned as the first. For the price it should been fresh and rich without a stale burned bitter taste. I asked the waitress to taste the coffee if she didn't believe me. She refused. Instead, she brought my bill and loudly commented to everyone in earshot that I didn't have any taste buds. I asked the cashier to take off the price of the coffee I did not drink. She complied. When asked if I wanted to leave a tip I said, "I would have if my waitress had not chided me for not being able to tell when coffee was bad." I didn't leave a tip.

As always the food was delicious and the server was great (thank you Vanessa).  After finishing our meal, I paid the bill and my husband and I decided not to rush off, but to relax a couple of minutes, talk, and finish off our beverages.  It was then that the restaurant manager, "Monica", came over to our table and asked if there was anything else we needed.  We said no and she replied "have a good day".  A few minutes later Monica and one of her colleagues came and stood near our table.  Every few seconds she would look my way--I guess they wanted us to leave.  When my husband got up to go to the cash register, Monica said to her colleague, "didn't they just go get change?"  And in fact I had, but needed additional change to give our sever, Vanessa, a larger tip.  While my husband waited in line at the register, Monica returned to the register area and told a waiting customer, "we are trying to get you seated together, but some people just won't leave, you know how that is".  "Monica" is unprofessional and should NOT be serving in a leadership role at your restaurant.  I guess it's time for my family to find another restaurant for Sunday brunch."}

COME HUNGRY!  There is no such thing as a "light breakfast" here.  Most entrees come with a side (seasoned potatoes or hash browns) and either coffee cake or toast.  The seasoned potatoes are delicious, nice and crispy with just the right amount of seasoning!  And always get the coffee cake!  They bring out the cake first and it's just the right amount of sweet to get you salivating for your meal.  It also pairs great with coffee. 

Since I'm not huge on breakfast or heavy meals, I always get one of their vegetarian dishes.  Like I said, their portions are huge!  But with the vegetarian options, I'm able to finish up the plate with a few potatoes left over. 

Veggie Benny - sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  
The GVP scramble - comes with mushrooms, spinach, avocado & muenster cheese topped with sour cream.  

I also love the feel of the restaurant. definitely has the old school vibe.  Also look around and read the signs! There's one that says something about putting down your phones & talk to each other like its 19?? (some year before cell phones)."}

Like many Americans, I find myself skipping the most important meal of the day, however, once in a while, breakfast is valid.  Today was one of those days.  My boss and I decided to have our meeting at The Cracked Egg, for a change of scenery.

AMBIANCE: The place is alright.  The decor is a little drab and boring.  There are booths and table tops, as well as a bar top to choose from.  I think it's kind of a lame attempt at a diner/breakfast nook-ish ambiance.  Hard to pin point, because nothing really comes together for me.  I do know, however, that it's very busy.  A lot of people seem to enjoy this place.  I'm guessing it's because of the food. LOL.

FOOD and SERVICE:  Today, I got the Eggs Benedict for $9.95.  The bread was kinda of soggy.  Although this entree is smothered with hollandaise, I've had a lot of benedicts to know the potential of the bottom bread.  The poached egg was cooked perfectly, the canadian bacon was thicker than what I'm used to, which is good.  The hollandaise was thicker than what I prefer.  My entree came with hash browns which was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The way it should be!  YUM!  All in all, my breakfast was a hit.

Here's where The Cracked Egg falls short for me.  Whenever I come into this restaurant, I always end up driving separately and meeting my party there.  If I'm the first person there, I'll get a table.  Although my entire party has not arrived yet, the server DOES NOT greet our table until all members of the party arrive.  This was the third occurence that I've noticed.  I think as courtesy, they should at least greet any member of the party, no matter what percentage is present.  I will say that they have employees taking beverage orders in the beginning which I appreciate.  Two instances though, including today, I needed to order right away so I could leave early and make a meeting at work.  That's where I see the benefit of the actual server coming by to greet whoever is there.

Please don't let my rant determine your decision to visit this place.  The food is actually good.  I appreciate the fact that they have healthy options like Garden Patch omelette, the lowfat scrambble, Lighten Up scrambble and an option to have fruit as your side instead of starch options.  Their menu is filled with lots of a great choices.  Please go in and try their coffee cakes.  They are to die for!"}

He recently tried their monte crisco, basically a ham and cheese sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried, he said it was meh and should be served at a carnival so I wouldn't recommend that dish unless you're a carni, I feel like carni's don't read reviews though. The potatoes that come with your breakfast have a great spice to them. I've had the same ones at various other breakfast hubs but they're my fav so I'm happy. Now on to the famous coffee cake. First off all you yelp readers should know that I absolutely hate cake in general. I don't have a sweet tooth and I'm just not down with the fluffy cake consistency. For some reason though the coffee cake here is irresistible! They switch up the flavors every day, chocolate chip is my fav. I've never tried crack (hi mom) but this coffee cake is so crazy good that I believe it may be just as addictive as crack. Defiantly. Maybe."}

As everyone has already pointed out, the coffee cake is fantastic. It is not exactly what you think of when people say coffee cake, it is more like a white cake with some fruit filling on the bottom and some delicious frosting on top. My only gripe is that I wish they told you what kind of coffee cake they had that day and that there was just a little more fruit filling.

We usually end up getting a skillet, but they also have delicious pancakes! I am in love with the Kicking Potatoes, seasoned potatoes, bits of bacon, and melted cheddar cheese, served with a side of salsa and sour cream. I also like the option to make your own skillet and if you are in the mood for veggies, the vegetarian skillet is a fantastic option. Most of the skillets also come with coffee cake, win!

Now, I am usually very satisfied with the food, but have received spotty service from this location. Nobody seems too happy to be working here, from the hostess, to the waitstaff, to the manager. I have even seen the manager take on a customer who had a food allergy and was very specific about his order, which they messed up. I don't think it is ever OK to argue with a customer, especially in this situation where it could have gotten really severe if the customer had a life or death allergy. There were quite a few people in the restaurant and the loud exchange was certainly avoidable, I think a sincere apology would have gone a long way. I was also present when they messed up a rather large take-out order for some of my fellow team mates at work and didn't do much to rectify the situation. 

I also really dislike the fact that you have to take your check up to the cash register. That area can get very congested in the morning since it is also the hostess station. If you manage to fight the crowd and make it to the register, I find it quite uncomfortable that they ask you how much tip you would like to leave. I don't understand why they can't just let you fill out the receipt like every other business. Overall, the food is good, but don't prepare to be WOWed by the service."}

I have been here before but never really pleased my palate. This time, I would like to say that I was very happy and full (for the entire day) with my meal. 

I got a scramble... Lucie's Scramble! Made with 3 eggs (yikes!) sausage, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms.... with 2 slices of giant muenster cheese melted on top! Not a single ingredient was lacking, and the portions are nothing short of plentiful. Yum 

I wanted to change up my order and avoid the coffee cake and seasoned potatoes (which are good, but distract me from my main meal). Went with the hash browns and toast, and I think I will followup on my decision next time. Yes... there will be a next time, regardless of the spotty service. 

As noted in previous reviews... service is a little on the off side, but not BAD. The food is totally worth it. Can't wait for my next breakfast outing."}

Entertainment Book coupon participant. This one is located in a large strip mall. We've eaten here before (but I don't remember what I ordered) with my FIL and his wife. But it was a while ago. We were seated within 10 minutes for getting our name on the waiting list. Last time, there was a much longer wait. My FIL said it was the slowest he'd ever seen (they were regulars). 

Our drink order was pretty quick. Our server came up shortly afterward. We were talking a bit, and it seemed like the food came out pretty quickly too. My FIL got the Monte Cristo-turkey, ham and swiss dipped french toast batter and deep fried (never had one, but it looked interesting- my FIL enjoyed it, it's his favorite thing to order here), his wife got the Veggie Benny- sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs in hollandaise sauce (looked very generous, she only ate half), I got the Homemade Corned Beef Hash- I only made a dent in it (the biggest of the bunch, came with 2 eggs/scrambled, seasoned potatoes andfresh warm coffee cake- hash browns and toast are also options), and my husband got the Tori's Tortilla- large flour tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, chorizo, green chiles and onions topped with salsa, cheese, and sour cream; jalapenos omitted- he didn't finish it (breakfast type burrito, my hubby loves burritos). It was delicious. The corned beef wasn't fatty, and the peppers and onions were a nice combination, but there was also some hash potatoes underneath the eggs and over the corned beef. The seasoned potatoes were perfect, not mushy, not greasy, and firmly cooked, just the way like it. This was a big meal, so I ended up taking the rest home; I'm pregnant but if I overeat, I will not feel good. The service was very good, our server checked on us several times and got us refills. 

Large portions, most breakfast items are $10.95 and under (maybe about 3 items are over that range). Good service. Great place for breakfast (in the same class as Omelet House and Jamms). Glanced at the Lunch menu, most items under are $10.95. 4 locations in the Las Vegas/Henderson area."}

It was a cute place and the servers were fine. 

Basic issue is that the food wasn't special and it was overpriced. With tax and tip I walked out of here paying $10 for a bowl of oatmeal. It wasn't steel cut oats, just regular Quaker Oats you add water to and it was served with brown sugar, milk, cheap cereal stale granola and a cup of berries, mostly blackberries. It was a healthy portion of oatmeal, but it should have cost closer to $5. I did try the coffee cake, which was good but not out of this world.  

I would rather go to the Egg and I or Bread and Butter for the same price. You get a lot tastier food."}

Well, I love food in general, but breakfast is happiness. I LOVE a great breakfast restaurant. After being torn away from Walker Brothers in Highland Park, IL when we moved to Vegas, I was desperate to find a comfortable, relaxed, no hassle breakfast eatery. Cracked Egg is one of them.

Their menu is great. I love that they have many different options: salad, soup, chili, omelet, chicken sandwiches and even burgers. I'm the kind of person that could eat a Thanksgiving dinner at 6:00AM, so variation is key. However, the more important is their massive gluten free menu. Cracked Egg's GF menu is one of the largest I've ever seen at any restaurant. PLUS, I could eat their seasoned potatoes and/or hash browns. I stuck with the hash browns because there is a small chance of cross contamination, but I was not disappointed; they were delicious!

It took me 15 minutes to make up my mind as to what to eat, and of course, when the waitress came to the table I changed my mind last minute and got the North Shore Scramble. Holy freaking happiness. Eggs were cooked perfectly, not runny but not dried out. All the ingredients were fresh, and those hash browns may have been standard, but you have no idea how great it was to 1. Eat hash browns without getting gluten-ed and 2. Too many places mess up hash browns and make my frown like a sad panda.The bacon was nice and crispy and gave it nice saltiness. I considered ordering another dish, the chili skillet, just to ensure the explosion of my stomach, but alas, I could not eat anymore.

My fiance ordered the standard eggs with kielbasa. Oh that kielbasa melted in my mouth - it was pure fatty processed foody goodness. I don't care what it's made out of. The kielbasa was great when smushed inbetween slices of toast and eggs. Thankfully, he gave me a couple bites of the kielbasa before he gluten-ed up his plate. I'm a huge fan of them cooking it on the flat top/griddle. The outside had a great snappy crust on it and was not too greasy. Oh, yummy pork product, I love you.

I will absolutely come here again, probably for their chili skillet. Yes, their chili skillet is gluten free. Gluten free chili at a restaurant other than Wendy's?!? YES PLEASE!!! Chili and I have a love affair every football season, but I think I will cheat on it soon and enjoy it at The Cracked Egg in a couple weeks. Or maybe I will have one of their sandwiches that is wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. Yes, this way I can rationalize eating 400 calories of moo-cow...because it's wrapped in veggies! Thank you Cracked Egg. Good service, delicious food and a great restaurant environment. Love.

P.S. Anytime you want to make gluten free coffee cake, please let me know and I will taste test it for you!

P.P.S. They have GF pancakes. I know exactly what I'm getting next time!"}

I know it's not a problem if the establishment isn't busy which it wasn't) she rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed as she went to go ask about another table.

Cons: 
-Its a bit crowded on the inside and the tables seemed smushed together.
-It took forever for us to get our check, which is always frustrating.
-The line at the register took FOREVER.

Pros:
- Food was awesome, always is.
- The muffins are just so soft and when the butter melts on them you instantly want more.
-When you have the waiters attention, they are all yours. They focus on you and your order. But then again maybe that's the hold up. Whoknows."}

However, the food is overpriced, portions are not huge, and service is usually bad.  Count on spending $12-15 per person for a meal, tax, and tip; add a few more bucks if you're getting a beverage.  Coworkers who suggested this place to me said I could have a full meal for $6; based on menu prices, I assume my coworkers consider toast and coffee a full meal.

The restaurant is very loud and cramped.  Your wooden chairs will get bumped into by anyone trying to pass and the screeching of wood on tiles will give you a headache.  There isn't much of a waiting area and given this place's popularity, you'll probably have to wait.

My chicken chile verde omelet was good, seasoned potatoes very tasty, and our various sandwiches good but nothing special.

The coffee cake was awful.  It was like stale angel cake purchased from a gas station, sprinkled with cinnamon, and stuffed with canned apple pie filling.

Good service usually changes my opinion of a restaurant, but this was downright bad.  Our waiter was curt, only gave us one coffee refill (after flagging him down), and tossed our check on the table before we'd finished eating.  The restaurant was significantly less crowded than when we arrived so I'm not sure why he was in such a hurry to get rid of us.  We're nice people who have worked in restaurants and sympathize with overbusy waitstaff.

I only go here when I'm with pretentious friends who insist on eating at local mom & pop shops instead of IHOP or Denny's.  Eat here if you must and enjoy your smug satisfaction; I'll be over at IHOP feasting on better food for less money."}

We went on a Sunday morning, and that was ill-advised. The place was packed with what looked like regulars, and we had a 20+ minute wait. 

We were shown to a table and service was decent. Within a couple minutes we had our drinks and placed our orders. I got the Country Bennie, which is like eggs Benedict with country gravy. She got the Cracked Croissant, which is a croissant sandwich with eggs, cheese and such. Both came with better than average hash browns.

Both were very good. The portions are fair, and should fill you up. I had to bring some food to someone at home, so I ordered up a couple Monte Cristo's. They were good, but not as good as other places. That being said, Monte Cristo's are hard to find, and I'm glad they have them.

The coffee cake looks amazingly good, although I did not have any.

One tip: The price is fair, but I did notice we seem to be the only one paying without a coupon. They do seem to also be in the coupon mailer, so if you haven't tossed it out yet, and you're thinking about going to The Cracked Egg, you should look for the coupon."}

I am glad they have a second location close to where I am living. I think one of their highlights is their Homemade Coffee Cake. I used to ask which flavor they currently had available but soon stopped after I had a few different ones and they were ALL delicious. This morning I was treated to Blueberry! I've had Apple, Peach and Cherry as well. 
When I crave going out for breakfast which is usually on the weekends, The Cracked Egg is on the top of my list. My favorite is their "Californian" omelet which has sliced bacon, sliced avocados and jack cheese with seasoned potatoes on the side. 
Based on my visits to both locations their service and food are great. They seem to always have plenty of people around taking care of guests so even if your server is busy you can always find someone to get you a refill or extra condiments, etc. 
I think their prices are fair and portion sized from my experience and what friends/family have ordered is good.  If you beat the breakfast rush you should get seated within a timely manner. I went around 10AM and was able to get a seat at the counter right away and they appeared to have a few tables open. When I was paying my bill to leave they were slammed with people crowding the entrance waiting for tables. 
Always leave full and enjoy going to The Cracked Egg for a weekend breakfast. Also a side note, on some occasions I had phoned in my breakfast order with their Rainbow location and within a timely manner went to pay/pickup and enjoy at home."}

The only issue that I have, and why I gave 4 out of 5 stars, is because there is no organization or management of people coming in and the people going out. 

Since the restaurant is set up for the diners to pay as you leave, there tends to be a crowd of people milling round the front reception area during their peak times, and you are never quite sure who is coming and who is going. 

Therefore you tend to run the risk of someone cutting in front of you because they don't understand that you are waiting to pay - which is what seems to happen to me on a regular basis."}

I love that you can choose between a side of toast or coffee cake - most places you are charged extra if you want another side and most times I don't even want toast so I'm glad that this was an option. The coffee cake was perfectly warm, soft, and fluffy. I love it.

I have been too another one of their property on my side of town. Always had great experience from the food, service, and one of my favorite go too breakfast restaurants. 

I ordered "The Enchilada" omelette. Instead of toast ALWAYS go for the coffee cake. The coffee cake no matter which one they offer (on this day think was cherry) not only is it fresh, steamy hot, moist, and nice BiG size piece. Awesome that you can substitute your toast for coffee cake! The seasoned potatoes so addicting really could go carb crazy have whole plate of it. I love the seasoning not sure what it is except perfect blend, just want too keep eating them, and perfect compliment with anything eggs or in my case omelette. The Enchilada lot of stuff going on inside the omelette. The enchilada sauce felt like that made all the ingredients come together in perfect harmony. Top off the omelette with the cheese. One of the better omelette ever had for breakfast. The portion size does not end with the coffee cake. Between the omelette and the generous amount of seasoned potato hearty and leave stuffed. 

The restaurant is much bigger in size then the one that closer on my side of town. It had more open air feeling too it cause of the size. The interior has the same vibe as the other location. Truly most important is the food is consistent with other location. Great breakfast/lunch spot!!!!! Our server was awesome the whole time staying on top of everything from our drinks and making sure everything going well.

I usually end up ordering the same thing: Chicken Fried Steak Skillet. It is a chicken fried steak over a bed of house potatoes, smothered in delicious gravy and topped with copious amounts of cheese. I usually order the two eggs that come with in on the side rather than on the skillet. 

I am not a fan of their omelettes. I think they lack a little flavor and flare, especially for the cost. 

One thing that is great here is their coffee cake. They usually have a different flavor every time I go. 

My main complaint about this place, aside from their omelettes (I like omelettes with meat, and their big bad wolf omelette (or whatever it is called) is definitely not laden with meat as you are led to believe) is that their service is slow. While I don't work there so can't know for sure, I would attribute it to how busy they are and a staff that is not large enough to handle everything. They also have a waitress there who never seems to like what she is doing. When I go out for breakfast, I don't want to deal with other people's problems and bad moods. That needs to be checked at the front door when the waitress comes in to work.

Nothing on the menu is out of the ordinary and its convenience of having 5 locations spread out throughout town is nice. I've been to almost all of them and they all serve the same quality of food and flavor. Also, they have a gluten sensitive menu available too and you can check it out on their webpage. 

Whether you're in the mood for their "breanne's basic", "fluffy and folded omelettes" or "eggs with attitude scramble" you can't go wrong. Also, depending on how busy they are you might opt out of ordering an omelette since per usual they take longer to make. The portions are generous as well. 


Today, I got a veggie skillet with turkey bacon. I was thrown off by the turkey bacon since it looks liked ham. It didn't taste like your regular turkey bacon too. 

Overall it's a plain Jane spot with bland coffee to their entrees and sometimes that's exactly want you may want for the first meal of the day. And if it's not then bring your own sauce for flavor! Lol Oh and the service is just as bland. Perhaps out server had a case of the Mondays or something."}

We are regular Sunday Brunch patrons at The Cracked Egg.  We always come late Sunday morning, knowing there will be a Sunday wait and we are prepared.  We check in and then visit Popcorn Girl for a sample or two and walk through the pet store to see the latest gadgets (or just look at the same pet toys from the week before ...).  When we run out of things to do, we go back and wait for our name to be called while checking our Facebook or playing on our phones.  The time goes by quickly and we are seated in no time at all.

Our kids love the kids menus with crayons.  Since they already have their regular meals, they get to coloring while we choose between the sinfully delicious choices and the more sensible and healthy options.  

BTW, when you are offered the choice of toast or coffee cake, try the coffee cake just once - YUM!

But don't think we are just Sunday visitors, we also come to this place for the occasional weekday breakfast or lunch.  We also often meet friends here for a much livelier meal.

This is Las Vegas' version of the local Sunday Brunch spot. Thank you Cracked Egg!"}

I have ate inside the restaraunt quite a few times but I only live like 2 miles away so I do to go orders a few times a month. 

They really have some amazing stuff on the menu. It is worth checking out the menu before you go so you are prepared. I'm a simple guy so i usually get coffee, the cakes & eggs combo which is basically 2 large pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 slices bacon. 

I've tried a few varieties of things other people with me have ordered like stuffed french toast of peanut butter, nutella. I've tried the eggs benedict, coffee cakes, biscuits in gravy, chocolate chip pancakes, etc. Really it is all very good! 

The place is very busy on the weekends. I got to go orders in like 15 minutues but sometimes if you go on a Sat/Sun morning you could have up to an hour wait to get seated and it is not a small restaurant. Thats a good sign! 

I think the only drawback is sometimes when I crave in the evening/night, they are closed. I think the hours are 6am-3pm which works for breakfast/lunch meals."}

The service here is actually really good. They staff was super attentive and I never had to ask for a water refills, but my server was very sassy in a TV sitcom sort of way. She tried to make little quirky jokes every time she came to the table, but they just came off like she was mad at the world and we were the cause of it. Like I said very TV sitcom-ish. 

The decor here needs to be updated desperately. It has a cafeteria look; very open and very cold, but with a country grandma style. By this I mean there's random farm and rooster decor on the walls. Which makes me laugh because roosters don't lay eggs. It's Science! 

The food is tasty, but basic. I was here with four other people and I tried everyone's dish... I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad; the salad for the guy who never orders salad. This was great in my opinion, big chunks of chicken coated in buffalo sauce on huge bed of fresh greens w/ eggs and tomatoes. My foodie friends ordered the "Veggie Benny", "The Cobb", and the "Pesto Scramble". 

The "Veggie Benny" was the star in this line-up. This plate comes with spinach, avocado, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, but lite in an interesting way, and the hash browns were golden brown and crispy. I would most likely order this if I came back to the Cracked Egg. The other dishes were forgetful and don't need to be mentioned in this review. 

This place needs a design overhaul and few updates on the menu. These simple changes could really elevate this place...Where's Robert Irvine?!?

Pro Tip: The baked goods in this place are steller. Try the Blueberry Muffin/Coffee Cake"}

The servers come by as soon as you are seated to take orders if you are ready, but they don't rush you if you aren't ready. The food comes out pretty quickly after ordering. 

The menu is huge with a nice variety of breakfast options. As the name implies most of the options are geared toward eggs, but they also offer pancakes and waffles. The omelets are made with three eggs so they are huge. Skillets are also filling options. The coffee cake that comes with many of the meals is moist and sweet. I'd suggest adding a side of coffee cake if your meal doesn't already come with it. I love that there are many options with a Mexican twist including chorizo options."}

My friends and family meet every Saturday at Egg Works near Sunset Park. The one time we decide to branch out to the other restaurants and it doesn't start off well at all. Our organizer checked it out a week ago and even called in a reservation for our large group. We get here and they apologize profusely because they allowed a large party of 17 people in just before us and pretty much told us calling in advance for reservations does not do any good. Not professional or organized. Not good for planned large parties, especially parties with several elderly and handicapped members. 

If you do want one that will actually honor large planned gatherings, professionally and with organizational skills, one who won't blame your party for their lack of both, then try Egg Works on Sunset. Not good, The Cracked Egg, not good. 

I'll update if we ever get a table.

We were seated at 30 min after we arrived and now feeling a little better. The server was very nice and prompt. 

Okay, now that I've had coffee and my MIL is comfortable, I'm going to upgrade the rating to 3 stars. Menu looks nice and I'm excited to try the coffee cake. 

Food and service was excellent. They don't do muffins like Egg Works, but they do make a very tasty apple cinnamon cream cheese coffee cake. We might try again for our group brunch and we hope it was just a fluke."}

Food: the coffee cake really was the star of the meal. Hot, fluffy, and flavorful. Extremely cinnamony. Was gone in a second. Veggie benny was pretty good, though I tend to prefer my poached eggs more gooey than completely runny. The hollandaise was not too heavy. The hash browns were crispy on the outside / tops and bottoms, but somewhat soggy in the centers. The chicken-fried steak was perfectly crispy on the outside, and the gravy was good. I'm not sure what all the hullabaloo about the seasoned potatoes is - ours were hard, dry, and extremely salty. 

Service: came right at lunchtime on a Saturday, but managed to get seated right away. Service started out great, but after the initial greeting, any time we needed anything we had to flag down the waitress. The only time she spontaneously stopped by was to drop off the bill, about 5 minutes after the food came out. Upon checkout, if you pay with a card, the hostess asks if you would like to add a tip to the card. I find this incredibly uncomfortable and puts pressure on patrons to tip maybe more than they normally would. I would much rather have them include a tip line on the receipt so I can tip as much or as little as I would like without feeling guilty or embarrassed. Maybe they do this on purpose to help their waitstaff earn more money in tips? Next time I will bring cash to leave on the table instead."}

Had breakfast arriving at 6:20 am.  Again hope management or the owner reads this post.

-No one to greet us, waited 5 minutes or so, sat ourselves.
-Noticed only one very busy super nice guy named Juan working his butt off.
-Within 20 minutes, Juan (by himself, no one else in the dinning room) was handling 14 tables  and over 35 diners by himself.

-More people coming in and no one to set them.  Juan running around trying to accomplish everything....greeting some of the people, running water and coffee, serving, busing, etc.  to now almost 20 tables with over 50 diners...(yes I am counting, my wife told me to stop).  But I was amazed by watching Juan do all these task.  

I hope Juan gets paid as a greeter host, server, food runner, bus person, and cashier because he certainly was doing all of these jobs almost seamlessly. 

Food prices have increased quite a bit.  Had the Chicken, gravy, eggs, hash browns, toast. 
-Eggs were good.
-Their gravy is not bad, I would say good...but not as good as Mr Mama's!
-Chicken was not good, mostly hard breaded batter.  I remember the chicken as being much better.
-HASH BROWNS...well awesome, probably the best that I have had here in town!

This place has so much potential and I really want to like it.  Saves me over 12 miles round trip from going to Mr Mamas (Rated #1 on yelp I believe) on Jones and Russell.

Oh, by 7am a young lady showed up to help Juan, whew!

It's definitely a solid breakfast spot for when you don't feel like cooking but also don't feel like going to far. I wouldn't say you need to venture across town to check this place out... Definitely not that phenomenal of a breakfast spot but it's enough to satisfy the taste buds! 

The first time I went, I was feeling adventurous and wanted to try something I had never had before! This being said, I went with the Monte Cristo. The dish in and of itself is out of the ordinary and I honestly REALLY enjoyed it! It was weird but a good weird! I would definitely get it again. 

My second time (and third... And probably will again on my fourth visit) here I got the bacon cheeseburger skillet. I love this skillet! It's the perfect mix of lunch and breakfast in one plate!! Want a cheeseburger but want eggs and potatoes too? Boom! It's all right there in your skillet. 

One day I do plan on trying an omelette of theirs that has polish sausage in it (being Polish, that'll be a real taste challenge!). When I do I'll be sure to let everyone know how it is! 

The thing that makes this place truly awesome, is the service. I've never had a bad experience with the service here! Granted, I've somehow managed to get the same server the last two times I've been, it doesn't matter. From what I could see all the staff is friendly and on their game!

So when I saw featured in a "breakfast" edition of Las Vegas Weekly, I made sure to stop in.

The strong suit of this venue is the creativity of its menu. There were no less than seven versions of Eggs Benedict, for example. Pastrami Benedict, Mexican Benedict, Veggie Benedict with Avacado, et. al. The entire menu was extremely diverse for a breakfast joint. There's a lunch/sandwich menu as well.

After that, much credit for customer service. Twice, the BUSBOY stopped to offer refills on my coffee.

My selections were tasty enough. Said another way, the food was of good quality. Not "rock my world" quality, but well above-average.

I think this place best fits, for me, as a morning-after breakfast nook with a lady friend. Solo, I'm still heading for Omelet House, where there are also many choices (though not quite as diverse as here), but the portions are much larger, for about the same price."}

Seem to have an extensive menu, but did not see chiliquiles on the menu, which is one of my favorites."}

My daughter had the mini chicks I think it was called and I built my own burrito. The food was so good and cooked just right. All the drinks we ordered tasted a bit off and they were just normal drinks so I am not sure if it was just their machine. The wait on a Sunday morning wasn't too bad, about 25 minutes. Our server was attentive but not intrusive and all the other staff were friendly as well. The only negative spot was two of the staff were vocal about some disagreement they were having with another staff member. It made it a bit a bit awkward."}

I was going through life thinking that the best eggs benedict in town could be found at the Peppermill. Oh how wrong I was!

Given that it's right down the street, Boyfriend and I decided to give The Cracked Egg a shot. Our 5 minute wait to be seated was great for 10:30 on a Saturday morning. Once seated, our drink order was taken almost immediately; actual drinks followed shortly. We ordered about 5 minutes after being seated. Twenty minutes later, food arrived! I had the traditional benedict. Boyfriend had the country benedict. I was floored by how delicious my food was. The eggs were wonderfully runny, the hollandaise was excellent and the Canadian bacon was smokey with no gristly bits. My side of hashbrowns was very tasty. Always a plus when there's enough egg yolk and hollandaise to dredge hashbrowns in! 

Service was quick and friendly. Food is seriously good, if slightly on the pricey side ($32, including tip, for two people). This probably won't be a weekly spot, but we'll definitely be back!"}

-The food is DELISH here.
-The service is pretty bad.

We waited about 10-15 minutes after being seated to order or drinks.. not to GET our drinks, just to order them. Another 5 minutes later we finally got our drinks. When we needed refills it took a bit, had to wave at the server to get attention a few times. Takes a while for the food, but once you get it you forget about the service. Yum!

I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with hash browns and I was in heaven. People I was with got the Greek omelette and the Nutella filled french toast, both were pretty good, according to them. 

I would definitely go back here, but because they are only open for breakfast/brunch there can be quite a rush. Next time I'll be sure to go earlier, maybe service will be better if the crowd is a little smaller."}

We hit this delicious place up right before we left back to Phoenix and damn..  that's all I can say.  DAMN DELICIOUS!

You go inside this place that happens to be inside of a strip mall and right away it has that home cooked meal feel to it.  The friendly staff seats in a booth (which we always prefer) and we get the drink orders out of the way.  I love iced tea, but their tea wasn't the best. Trust me, Im not knocking down stars for that. lol.   

As I look over the menu, I always find myself always getting the same type of food.. omelet or pancakes with some sides.  I decided to go out of the box and try something new.  Ready for this?

Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast...   

Yep..  I ordered that and let me tell you how amazing it was.  It was about six good sized slices that were filled with peanut butter and grilled to perfection, topped with bananas and honey, finished off with some hot maple syrup.  I was in breakfast heaven.  

I could have easily split this meal up with someone and didn't finish it, but I highly recommend it.. especially if you love peanut butter!

i cant wait to get back to this place!"}

You pay at the hostess area. The credit card machine broke and I was waiting for 20 minutes for it to be fixed. They held my credit card hostage and wouldn't let me go get cash. They handled the entire situation extremely poorly. No one apologized for the situation, no one cared at all that this happened. They just started helping everyone that had cash while a lime started building for people with credit cards. 

Once it was fixed, they helped every person in line except me. I was trying to get their attention because they were holding my credit card this entire time. I was seriously going to leave without paying because the service was so terrible I didn't want to give them a dime, but I couldn't because they were holding my card. I'm not even upset that the machine broke and the wait was long to pay, I'm just really pissed about how this was handled and how no one apologized or gave two shits about the customers. Not to mention the hostess screwed up the transaction of the guy before me and put someone else's bill on his card that was much hire than what it was supposed to be.

I had a lot of gripes at first, but I've been back since with a pleasant experience. The parking was only bad the first time and the food was better quality. My wife loves the Benedict.

The first thing I noticed was the terrible parking lot. There are way too many businesses in the shopping center for the size of the parking lot.

Parking aside, I heard great things about this place, so I was looking forward to breakfast. Also, the place was packed, so I assumed the food would be good. It was. The portions were big, and the service was good.  Their breakfast was a little better than IHOP, but priced twice as much. A breakfast for two was $28. A couple of basic omelets, potatoes and drinks for $28? How in the world does this place justify these ridiculous prices? 

Advice to management: You blew it on the location with the parking lot, but there's nothing you can do about it now. Cut the price and cut the portions. No one wants to take an omelet home for leftovers.

Fix the value, and I'll give it 4*, because the food was as expected and the staff was pleasant."}

Just happened upon this gem while searching for a drugstore. My husband LOVES eggs so he immediately said yes when I mentioned going here for breakfast. I had the peanut butter and banana french toast, it was amazing! The portion size of my meal was huge and well worth the price. My husband got the Monte Cristo, he loved it! If you are a local, I highly recommend checking this place out. I just discovered there is more than one location, so when we're in LV or Henderson again we will be eating here again for sure!"}

After reading the reviews I was worried about the service but still wanted to go because of their gluten free menu. When we arrived the service was great. Nothing spectacular but definitely not rude like some comments imply. 
We ordered a burger which I heard was great and I had a gluten free skillet without eggs (they happily substituted fruit for it). Both seasoned potatoes and toast may have cross contamination so I stuck with the hash browns and a gluten free muffin. This is where it gets AMAZING. I have never eaten such a good gluten free muffin. I was really scared that it wasn't gluten free after all. But no reaction. So I ordered an extra one for the road. Still scared while I'm eating it now. Seems too good to be true ;-) 
Overall great gluten free safe breakfast joint with the best muffins. #happyceliac"}

The Good: It's exactly what you'd expect: charming breakfast food. Only it comes with amazing hash browns and toast. Also the non-breakfast food here is great too: good burgers, sandwiches, etc... I think of this as the original egg based breakfast joint in Vegas. I'm sure they didn't invent the concept, but it's great, fast, and consistent.

The food isn't 'creative' per se, it's exactly as diverse as it needs to be. They have specials that are usually pretty excellent in and of themselves.

The bad: Well, they close at three and they serve jelly in the standard little containers measuring 1/20th of a teaspoon. You need like thirty for one piece of toast. 

WTF: GREEN AND BLACK MINTS ARE NOT DELICIOUS. KILL THEM WITH FIRE.

Suggestion: pancakes are an untapped creative medium. Please consider."}

But when I do go, The Cracked Egg is one of the places I'll go to. Whenever I try to go on a Sunday the lines are out of the door so I recommend Saturdays. The restaurant has two separate dining rooms so there's plenty of seating, especially if you don't have many people in your party.

Their menu has a ton of variety. With most of the breakfasts you'll have a choice of toast or coffee cake and potatoes or hash browns. These are essentials for any solid breakfast spot. On this last trip my boyfriend and I shared the macadamia coconut pancakes and the green scramble. The pancakes are so good they've inspired me to try to recreate them at home. There's plenty of coconut shreds in each bite with the occasional crunch of macadamia nut. The dish comes with three huge pancakes and we were each only able to finish one. The green scramble was also delicious, filled with broccoli, chiles, spinach and chicken. The star of this show was for sure the green salsa. I could drink this salsa it was so fresh and yummy. I would order any dish on the menu that has this (they seem to offer a lot of Mexican inspired breakfasts). 

The Cracked Egg is the perfect every-so-often stuff your face full of breakfast food and lay on the couch of the rest of the day. I can't do it very often but when I'm ready for it again and craving those coconut macadamia pancakes I will pretty much always choose to come here."}

Kalila and I came here on Valentine's day morning and the place was packed.

Kalila really enjoyed The Green Scrambler. I don't remember if that's the right title, but it was the last item on the SCRAMBLERS section of the menu. It had spinach, broccoli, and other vegetables in it. She was so happy with her choice!

I had the big bad wolf. It is the equivalent of a meat lover's pizza, but for an omelet. There's bacon, ham, sausage....

Everyone has to try to coffee cake side at least once (served as an option next to buttered toast)

This place is always busy and plenty of times there will be a wait. The time you lose in the wait, you make up for in how quickly your food comes out.

All of my servers have always been very nice and friendly."}

My friend Lisa L had the pancakes and I had the tropical french toast... I know the description said coconut but this thing was COVERED in shredded coconut. Like the whole surface was pretty much shredded coconut. The flavor was great and the texture was nice but I literally filled up on shredded coconut. We spent about 20 minutes sitting around waiting for our server to come back so we could get our bill and though he walked by like four times, he didn't so much as glance in our direction. By this time, the crowd had really thinned out too so it's not like it was crazy busy. The food was good enough to warrant three stars but the service left us frustrated. It would be one thing if the server was so busy he couldn't make it through the room but we saw him pass so many times and it took forever to flag him down."}

This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend. This location in particular was our second stop at a Cracked Egg location.

There was a bit of a wait at this location on a Sunday, but they still moved the line pretty quickly. This location also has a great outdoor patio dining area which unfortunately was full. We waited for no longer than 10 minutes and service was super-fast and friendly! Tip: If there is a long wait, you can sit at the counter and not wait at all. Another plus about this location: our meals came out really quickly! So quickly that even our waitress said it was quick! Given that we were famished, we definitely appreciated that.

Having been through the drill at their other location, I requested the gluten free menu and was excited to try yet another meal here. SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes. 

At this location I tried the Lighten Up scramble which consisted of egg whites, with turkey, diced green peppers and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was delicious - the ingredients tasted really fresh and light. I ordered the hash browns again because they are so darn good - perfectly seasoned and crispy! 

My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs! 

Will most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches."}

Everything here is very affordable ranging between $7-15 dollars for a large portioned meal.  

My favorites at cracked egg:

The Monte Cristo
Turkey, ham and swiss cheese sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried. served with hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  This is absolutely amazing and hits so many of your senses that it will confuse you but it is delicious!  

Coconut Macadamia Short stacks are a great side to add to any of the meals.  If you are looking for a healthier option, the oatmeal overload is a HUGE bowl of oats, loaded with nuts, raisins, berries, and granola on the side.  

Another one of my favorites is The Country Benny:  a biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs and smothered in gravy

And when I say loved I mean we used to come almost every weekend (provided neither of us worked in the morning). However neither of us have had the desire to return recently. In a nutshell, service is not up to par and the food has been mediocre at best. 

First of all, I get that the servers may be tired considering they open at 6am but don't take that out on the patrons. The last couple times my boyfriend and I have been here we've felt rushed from the moment we sat down. And it's not one server in particular, it's all of them. Often we get asked if we know what we want to eat before we even order our drinks. Then 30 seconds after we get our food the check is dropped off. Can they be any more obvious that they want to go home? Doesn't make me feel welcome. 

Secondly, the food has been a hit and miss lately. The skillets are always excellent. My favorite breakfast is eggs benedict and the last time I got it here it was very cold like it had been sitting out. *thumbs down* However, the coffee cake is great which is why I'm giving this place 2 stars. 

Overall, I feel like the cracked egg could go back to what it used to be if changes are made and the staff are taught what QUALITY and SERVICE are. I won't be returning anytime soon."}

It was okay but nothing special. So when we found ourselves in Henderson during breakfast time and with a coupon, we decided to try it again.

It was about 1pm on Saturday and the place was mostly empty. Not a red flag really because the recession is killing the restaurant business. Service was pretty quick - sat down, ordered drinks from the helper, the waiter was so fast that I had to ask for a couple more minutes, and he came back in a couple of minutes. All was going well until I ordered. Club Sandwich - no ham, no mayo, bacon crispy, 1000 island dressing on the side - and fries. "Sorry, we ran out of fries." What???? No fries???? Big red flag - obviously the fries are not made fresh. But, you may be thinking, perhaps they just ran out of potatoes. Possible, yes, but they still had the breakfast potatoes that were served with my husband's meal. So, I am really not happy about this situation. Not because of there being no fries as much as them not being made fresh. I mean, seriously, In-N-Out makes fries - from real potatoes - all day long. However, I did regroup and try to enjoy my lunch.

As I said, I had the Club Sandwich. It was good - came with avocado and cheese which is a huge bonus for me and not always included. Unfortunately, it was nothing special. And, believe it or not, it was too big for my mouth so I had to cut it up. 

My husband had a Sausage Scramble which was not actually scrambled together but layered. He said it was quite nice (that is like 4 stars in ratings talk). And, his coffee was getting refilled promptly AND they gave him more creamers than he could use. So, overall, great meal for the hubby.

I have seen some of the other reviews raving about the breakfast items and perhaps that is where I went wrong. If we go again (which we probably will since I have another coupon), I am thinking I will try the Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes. I will let you know."}

Coffee cake alone is enough reason to come here. It's light, fluffy, warm, steamy, sweet, and they're constantly updating the flavors like a pumpkin one in the fall or the berry one I had last. 

My favorite things to order for an entree are the scrambles, particularly the South Shore with chicken and avocado. Their corned beef hash is scrumptious and tasty as well.

Tried soup and salad also, portions are HUGE. Great place to brunch."}

My favorite is the Joe's scramble, a great egg dish with spinach, ground beef and cream cheese.  They serve potatoes similar to the ones at Egg Works/Egg and I, but I find the seasoning to be lacking at Cracked Egg.  So, I ask for extra seasoning on the side.  The chicken fried steak is VERY solid at this place.  Additionally, the specials are usually good, so check those out.  It's a large restaurant, so even during heavy traffic times the wait is usually not awful.  Also, kid friendly."}

The service is friendly and they will split meals as well. They also have half orders of the salads, which are pretty large. It's a popular place, so get there early if you don't want to wait (but the wait isn't too bad). Goes to show you, good food draws a crowd."}

The Veggie Skillet with Corned Beef $10.90

The Sweet Potato Skillet $10.50

Coconut and macadamia nut pancakes $8.95

My veggie skillet was pretty good. I loved the mix of broccoli, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes with the fried potatoes (and meat of course). My wife gave her skillet 6/10 bc she said her potatoes were not so crispy. I wouldn't recommend the pancakes as the coconut is not fresh coconut but coconut from a prepackaged bag. That kind of coconut is too sweet and with added syrup made the dish too sweet for my tastebuds. The one good aspect here is that the skillets came with their signature coffee cake (or toast if u prefer). Their coffee cake was pretty good. The texture was so light and soft and way better than Starbucks. After 4 or 5 bites however, it does becomes a little too sweet so I suggest sharing one with another person."}

The coffee cake is okay, it's more like a vanilla cake than a sweet bread creation. It's only my preference, however. 

What really shines is the service. Juan is probably the best waitperson ever, he makes sure your coffee is always topped off, checks back frequently, and if something isn't right, he has no problem fixing it. Never grumpy or distracted, and even when he's super busy he still takes care of you. 

Highly recommended."}

After we had finished our food and before our plates were cleared, our server brought a nearby table their food, then got in a conversation with another table and his back was to us. He talked so long that the first table FINISHED their meal and he was still talking, ignoring everyone else. All we wanted was our check. Finally a third table asked if he could please check on their food and he was not pleased at being interrupted. He informed her that he has other tables, not just her, and stormed off to the kitchen. Rude. And to top it all off, 30 minutes after leaving both my husband and myself (we ordered different foods and different drinks) were extremely ill. Gut wrenching horribleness.

It's always been pretty good which is why we went back. After yesterday, we will never go back. There are so many food options in Vegas and Henderson that to be treated with poor service, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. 

It started from the moment we walked in. For some reason the hostess had an attitude, barely said two words to us, walked us to the table, put our menus on the table without a word, and walked away. Then it took about 10 min before anyone came up. Mind you this was 1:15 on Friday. By no means busy. We were ready to order, and I told the waitress we were in a hurry because we were on a lunch break. I ordered the Monte Cristo which clearly states on the menu comes with hash browns or home fried potatoes, something like that. When I order, she says do you want French fries. Threw me off because that wasn't a choice. Then the coffee cake was burnt on the bottom. Why would you even serve that. That's always been my favorite thing there. We ate the top but it just wasn't as good. You could clearly tell there was a problem with it and she never asked about it the entire time we were there. In fact, she left the plate with all its burnt crumbs on our table the the entire meal. It's like she wanted us to be taunted by it. 

Then the food came about a good 15 min later. We are starting to panic by this point because we have to get back to work. There is no way all of this should have taken closer to an hour. I have a deep fried sandwich for crying out loud. I swear she put our food in late. We know that doesn't take that long. When the food comes, I ask for the check right away, and my daughter asks for ranch. She's brings the check but we never see the ranch nor do we see her again. Not once. I had to ask a bus boy for a container for the rest of my sandwich. Which by the way the sandwich was burnt as well. Very crispy.

You have to pay up front. The person up there asks how it was, and I said "not good". She either is inexperienced on how to handle that response or she just didn't care. All I heard in response was her mumbling under her breath "oh sorry to hear that" as she's facing the cash register ringing me out. That's it. We'll take our money elsewhere."}

I love eating breakfast. Its not unusual for me to go to Denny's at 8pm and order breakfast. And I'm very picky with my breakfast, particularly my eggs.

I ordered the Veggie Benny, which is their vegetarian version of eggs benedict. It has avocados, grilled tomatoes, fresh spinach, two poached eggs, and Hollandaise sauce. 

I don't even know how to express how much I love this place. It came with a side of buttery hash browns--and by buttery, I don't mean greasy, I mean deliciously rich. The Veggie Benny was amazing. Seriously. It was the perfect blend of fresh eggs, creamy Hollandaise sauce, freshness from the spinach and avocado, and just a hint of sweetness from the tomatoes. My boyfriend got something to eat too, and he loved it. I don't remember what he got, probably because I was too busy trying to stuff my face full of amazing-ness. (I think he got waffles or pancakes?)

The service was ok. But the taste-gasm I had made up for the so-so service. 

Overall, I LOVED this place.
I wish they were open at night."}

This place is basic and quick.  Not much to look at but the food hits the spot.  Many of the items on the menu are similar to other places.  The hashed brown was not exactly what we had expected - didn't like it.  One of the order came with a coffee cake and it was a slice of warm buncake with sweet filling.  Strange and strangely nice.

It would be nice to try many items on the menu if I can.  Since this is only 1 exit away from my friend's place, I think it can be done :)"}

- The eggs benedict
- French toast
- Bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant.

Walking in to the restaurant with my mom we were greeted by the cashier and told the wait would be 5 minutes; no problem. When my name was shouted (as if there was a fire mind you), the "hostess" snatched the silverware and menus and raced off to the table.  She did not so much as look back to see if we were following her, nor did she even say anything to us as we were seating ourselves. Why? Oh yeah, that's because she was already back at the hostess stand before we even pulled our own chairs out.

This atrocious moment in customer service left an extremely sour taste in my mouth prior to even being helped by our server; who's service was also sub par.

Thankfully the food was the only redeeming quality and the friendly cashier guy.

But, since moving here, we've noticed that LV is not as much of a brunch town as some of its Northeastern, Midatlantic and Midwestern neighbors (We miss you Chi... SNIFF). So, when one of my girls suggested the Cracked Egg for brunch recently, I couldn't say "I'm in" fast enough. 

I knew that there were others, like me, who missed brunch when I saw a line the size of India outside this resto. But, when I had my first bite of the GVR (the avocado, muenster, egg white combo is stellar!), I realized that people line up not JUST because they miss brunch BUT ALSO because the food here is delish! 

Whatever your reason for coming to the Cracked Egg, you will be in for a treat. Service is great. The food is tasty. And, for a reasonable price (it came to about $100 incl. a 20% tip for 8 of us), you will have a great brunch. 

A word to the wise: these folks will accommodate your meal to suit your request so don't be shy to ask. Also, if you order toast and don't want it to arrive pre-buttered, make sure to preference "Dry" toast. The same is true for "Light" cheese, egg whites (in place of eggs), and subbing the potatoes (the seasoned potatoes are awesome!) for fruit or cottage cheese."}

The last few times I've visited the coffee cake has been a fruit that I'm allergic too so it was great to finally have a piece that wasn't mango or peach. I think they should have a regular like crumb/brown sugar coffee cake as an option as well, I feel like they'd do a great job at it.

The plus side of this place is that the restaurant is clean, cozy and has some friendly staff members (all additional to pretty good food). 
   The downside is the service is lacking a 5 star rating. The hosts are always behind the counter and to busy to always be paying attention. For a restaurant that gets this busy they really need to hire extra staff. I don't view them as rude, because they're doing the best they can. Its just not top customer service. Its normal to see newbies walk in & not know what to do from lack of a greeting. 
       The waiters/waitresses are very quick- not to chatty. For some this is a plus, so its really a matter of preference. Personally I enjoy a "hello, welcome,how are you?" Type of intro. Especially for first time- menu recommendations, which are always a plus coming from an employee.
     The prices seem a bit high to me for what you get. Granted the food is good.. but for a $9-13 omelet I expect a bit more. 
   I will say their coffee cake is always a hit with us. No matter what the flavor is.  
    Better than a big time chain breakfast place like IHOP or Denny's but has room to improve. Either way we enjoy eating here."}

Don't let the wait turn you away!! No matter how many people I see outside, I've never waited more than 20 minutes. The crowd also comes in swarms so you may see a line when you get there, 5 minutes later you'll be the only party waiting. 
First of all order the coffee cake. Orders come with the option of toast or coffee cake and you should never choose toast. You can make that at home. The fresh baked sweet coffee cake with marmalade center, you just can't. 
The portions here aren't too big, with Egg Works portions being bigger, but I think the quality is better. Also, the coffee cake is better. 
The Cracked Egg is your average American local owned breakfast joint. You can't go wrong with them."}

It felt like a country vineyard type place. It was just very charming. Our service was not bad, just rushed it seemed like. Maybe they need to hire a couple more people in the morning rush of the weekend!

They proudly display their many restaurant awards around the restaurant-- awards which are well earned. The atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable-- the decorations aren't overly fancy but the interior is fairly well maintained.

Service tends to be pretty good here--even when it gets busy. The girls at the front can get pretty swamped during the Sunday rush but they always get the bill worked out right in the end. The waiters are pretty friendly and they know their menu pretty well. Subsitutions can be usually be made without much fuss. The coffee is pretty good, and the coffee cake is heavenly ( you need to try it at least once.)

The seasoned potatoes do definitely stand out here-- they are easily the best I've ever tasted. They aren't overly seasoned, arent too greasiy, and they have a satisfying crunchiness to them. Portions here are pretty hefty--maybe not Hash-House-A-Go-Go big, but respectable. Bring a decent appetite to make your trip here worthwhile.

I've tried a number of their dishes, from their fluffy and satisfying pancakes to their wide variety of egg dishes. Waffles are heavenly here--much better than you would find at IHOP or other large corporate spots. There aren't too many skillet options but I suggest you try  the vegetable egg skillet with chicken. The signature egg dishes go well with a side of cholula sauce but most are so well seasoned that you may not find you need it. The omelettes are fluffy and cooked just right. They never skimp on avocadoes or meat here. The wheat toast always arrives lathered in real butter. I recently enjoyed their unique pesto scramble. The french toast is rich and flavorful. This place simply does breakfast right and has earned its keep as one of the elite breakfast destinations in Clark County."}

My first time ever trying the dish and I will need to try it elsewhere to see if i still dislike it. I could say that without ever having it before, I'm sure it is suppose to have some flavor. The holandaise sauce was just a visual effect, nothing to it. Every bite tasted like egg yolk and that's it just bland as could be. The potatoes did have seasoning and flavor and are worth ordering. I felt it was overpriced as well. My wife had pancakes and 2 eggs(sunnyside not over easy as ordered) with bacon coffee and one orange juice( i would of had another but the no one came back until we were finished) and it was over $30.

One tome before that and one time after, I was alone as I am most of the time. Service was slow both times, I had a diet coke( don't drink coffee) which finally came halfway thru the meal. I tried to get the servers attention to no avail. The last time when the bill came, I was charged for a diet coke and coffee. I asked the server about it and it took her 5 minutes to tell me that she couldn't figure outhow to refund the $2.00. So she gave me $2 out of her pocket.  
 I sort of blame the iffy service level on thefact that I know servers hate waiting on one person because they know the tip won't be as much. Food is good 
Service is so- so"}

Most places are the same ol', same ol'.  Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns.  The Cracked Egg doesn't deviate too much from this standard. It mostly offers typical breakfast fare - an assortment of omelets, pancakes, scrambles, etc.  If you're in the mood for something relatively unique they do have plenty of options for interesting omelet combinations, a delicious benedict ole (heart attack on a plate), and their "coffee cakes" - a standard side with many of the menu items - are divine (and flavors vary daily, it's not your typical coffee cake, they must use smooth as silk cake flower and maybe add in sour cream or something to give it creaminess and tang).  My favorite standard is the huevos rancheros.  A simple tasty sauce covers refried beans, eggs how you like them, sitting on a flour tortilla and topped with melted cheese and jalapenos.  It's simple, but they do it well.  Not too much cheese (I really don't need to eat 12 oz of cheese in a given meal like some places believe), medium spicy peppers, and plenty of beans, just how I like it!

It's not the most unique food you can find (although it's as unique as any I've found in this city) nor is it on the top of the healthy list, but it's satisfying and consistent, reasonably priced, and has become my weekend go-to place!"}

This is mostly because this place is "meh" enough that I couldn't figure out what I thought about it.

Service is pretty poor.  One morning we brought my father here while he was in town for a visit.  We had to wait ten minutes for someone to even offer us a drink.  If Dad wasn't so hungry from his long plane ride, we would have left.  Even when we were finally served, the service left something to be desired.  My dish was cold and under-seasoned.  

Some time later, I decided to give The Cracked Egg another try.  There are enough positive Yelp reviews that I thought maybe I just had an anomalous bad experience.  But the second time, it was even worse.  I asked to substitute egg whites in my skillet...when it came out with normal eggs and I asked to have it made correctly (very nicely, I might add), I received an audible groan in response.  The waitress acted as though it was a huge inconvenience for her to walk back to the kitchen.

The extra star is for the coffee cake, which my dad loved.  Other than that, I don't really see why I would visit The Cracked Egg when there are much better breakfast joints in town.  I won't be back."}

Dreena was our server this morning, and she was great. She was attentive and very professional. 

We always split a breakfast and get a side of some kind. So we ordered the Benedict, replacing the Canadian Bacon with regular bacon, and then decided on a coffee cake. We ordered coffee, and I like that there was regular cream as well as vanilla creamer already at the table. The coffee was really good. Nice and hot, and had good flavor. 

Our coffee cake came out very quickly, and after about three bites of that our breakfast arrived. The coffee cake was very crumbly, but really flavorful. Nice vanilla flavor with a hint of lemon in the icing. The eggs Benedict was not a huge portion, actually rather small. Definitely not worthy of sharing like we typically do. Good to know, so next time we will actually get separate breakfasts. I like their use of green chiles throughout the menu, so we will be checking those out at some point. 

We arrived at 9:30 Sunday, and the place was jamming. It was loud, but not bad. We felt rushed, even though our server made sure to tell us we were not to be in any hurry. But with our breakfast coming out in mere minutes, and the small portions we were done quickly. The line to pay was really long. That was just bad timing on our part. But the line wrapped along the wall, and in front of the kitchen where the servers all come and go with food. It was hectic. Not the greatest experience, but we will give it another try."}

Upon entering the restaurant on a Sunday (My bad, but we were hungry) we were met not greeted by a frownie faced hostessed that addressed us like a herd of cattle.  No put on edge, I awaited to see what was going to happen next.

after a relatively short wait, we were taken to a table where all the scraps from the previous diners and been swept on to the bench I was about to sit on.  I waited to have it cleaned before I sat down.

We sat down to await our server and after several minutes I pulled out my phone and activated the stopwatch feature to see just how long this was going take.

Four minutes before someone other than our server got the drink orders.  When the drinks arrived they were followed by a shower of straws thrown down by the angry lady.

My Yelp senses start kicking in and I remained calm and went into surveillance mode.

The first thing I noticed was that not many employees seemed to be smiling.  The Sunday rush must really have taken it to them.

When we finally ordered from our waiter he was somewhat relaxed but had an edge to him that made me twitchy on a Sunday morning.

I ordered up Greek Scramble  and found to be much as it is at the other establishments....pretty good.

The negative energy in the air and curt demeanor in addition to my cup running empty with a refill not to be found caused my stomach to sour.

This is my last run on this restaurant even though Gary Oldman has supposedly dined there.

Has a nice mix of a "diner" feel while being clean, modern, and having the service experience you'd expect in a regular restaurant. We managed to time our visit just right as we were seated immediately. Since we have kids, it's always nice to have a menu for them to color. They provide colored pencils for kids instead of crayons, so just a heads up if you have little little ones. 

My wife ordered the Carnitas omelette. I always hesitate to get things like that because the Carnitas aren't usually authentic and it ends up just being regular pork. In this case, they were perfect. Very flavorful and loaded into the omelette. It's also topped with a healthy amount of sour cream. Very balanced, delicious dish. 

I opted for the ham and eggs. The ham steak is huge, well prepped, and goes great with however you take your eggs. We also both got the seasoned potatoes with our meals and they were super good. Sides are always best when they compliment the main dish  and the potatoes do just that. Well seasoned, large portion, and just crispy enough on the outside while staying soft on the inside. Could not be better cooked. 

The real kicker of the meal was the coffee cake. Instead of toast or other bread, you can opt for coffee cake with your meal. Since we went in the fall, the coffee cake was pumpkin chocolate chip flavored. It was delicious, light, and humongous. It's a little lighter than a traditional coffee cake, but still very good. 

Service was top notch throughout our experience. Even paying our check at the front after we were done was incredibly smooth despite the entrance being packed with people.

Man, I love this place.  The egg scramblers are delicious, and the peanut butter french toast is absolutely FANTASTIC.   Buttery hashbrowns are always a must.  Try it..but do keep in mind that they are a  fast-pace in and out breakfast place.  If you want to linger over a bloody mary and mimosas, go to brunch at the Bellagio or Mon Ami Gabi."}

The Cracked Egg has continued to serve great food with good service.  They usually have a continuous stream of customers.  Even with that, your wait time is short.  

The Pesto Scramble has quickly become my usual order.  They have the perfect amount of pesto with diced chicken, spinach and feta sprinkled on top.  The seasoned potatoes are a great accompaniment.  Yummy.  You have your choice of toast or coffee cake.  I always get the homemade coffee cake.  It changes everyday and would highly recommend getting this.  

Service can be a little spotty but I'm guessing it's how busy they are.  It's not bad though and won't hold that against them.  

Stop in a check them out! I'm always happy to dine here."}

It's near The Legacy Golf Club so it was a prime location for us to eat breakfast.  Everything we ordered was either excellent or really good.

Here is the list of dishes, if I can recall them all.

Huevos Rancheros
Chili Verde Rancheros (This was my order.  It was excellent)
Oatmeal (It was the largest bowl of oatmeal I've ever seen.  It came with a bowl of beautiful fresh berries.  My friend loved it)
Chicken and gravy as well as biscuits and gravy (It looked great.  He said it tasted great)
Bacon and eggs (He said the eggs were cooked perfectly)
Carnitas Omelette (This was my dish on day 2 because I wanted to try something different.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because the omelette had way too many onions.  They were tasty, but just too many).

If I'm in the neighborhood the next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely going to The Cracked Egg."}

This location is in Henderson so if you live in the area or are just driving through the area, you don't need to look any further for a solid place to eat. This place is all about simple egg dishes, pancakes, french toast and coffee cake. Their homemade coffee cake is to die for when hot, so make sure when asked if you want toast or coffee cake you order the coffee cake.

I often get scrambled eggs, with home fries, and sausage patties here, mostly because it reminds me of how these things taste back home in New Jersey. The potatoes are seasoned in a spicy cajun mix which I really love, the eggs taste farm fresh and the sausage patties are always juicy and delicious.

If you are in the mood for lunch they also have a tons of salads, sandwiches and burgers to choose from. My favorite lunch items are the patty melt with pepper jack cheese or the tuna melt. Both come with a side (usually fries) and both were good choices. I still would suggest sticking to breakfast though, as that is their top specialty, not lunch.

The thing that puts this place on my radar besides the quality breakfast is the service. I've never had a bad experience with the service here after years of going on the weekends, weekdays, whenever. Keep in mind they are only open from 7am-3pm, so plan accordingly. 

Like others have said, this is not the kind of place you need to go across town for, but if your in the neighborhood or live around the area, than it's worth trying out at least once. Much better then any strip breakfast you could find."}

My holding back on the five star review was that the hollandaise sauce was just not as acid as it should be, needed more lemon & had a sweetness that was a bit off putting. The hash browns were just okay, a tad greasy for me. My friend ordered eggs scrambled with cream cheese and a veggie and she thoroughly enjoyed it. She had coffee and said it was also very good.

We walked in and were sat immediately. Service was fast and friendly. The drinks came quickly and so did the refills. We ordered a Sicilian pizza and a large salad. Pizza was delicious and so was the salad. Grilled chicken on top of the salad was warm. The salad was large enough for two people. Don't make the mistake of ordering that whole thing for yourself. I really can't complain about any of it. The atmosphere is above and beyond what I would expect for a Sammys. I would go here with my friends."}

I have very high expectations seeing it's my birthday dinner. I choose to give them my money which will never happen again.

The chopped salad was the worst salad ever. No server came and asked if everything is ok. So here's my advice.... Do not give a server a busy station, servers need to communicate with customers as people because last time I check I was a person and I can be talked to about anything. The manager was absolutely amazing and I thank him for that but no service recovery helped us. Please retrain your servers. The customers deserve that for giving you their money and are there for a positive experience so they will be repeat customers. I hope this changes because it's just another checked off place that I will never go to."}

Pros: awesome menu and even better beer selection! 

Cons: kinda pricey, spot on for the "area" since it's across the highway from The District but two lunches and 4 "craft" draft beers later was like $55! 

The price won't stop us from coming back. It'll be interesting to see how this place works out after a few months. Service was great but they had a ton of people on the wait staff since they just opened.

Wonderful pear pizza. Good service even though the they were training a newbie server.

The Old Fashion drink was close to expected. The comp birthday treat was really good. The ice cream came in a wine glass dripping in caramel and chocolate sauce. Very unique since the sauce held the glass to the serving plate as well as lined the inside of the glass and was layered over the ice cream.

Yes indeed, will return.

We always loved the food and atmosphere, but the service was consistently terrible so we stopped coming here. This past weekend we decided to return and see if they've improved. Our service was great and we can now gladly add this back as one of our go to spots near home. 

The inside of the restaurant has a beach/Florida theme. Plenty of windows allow for a bright dining room. The atmosphere is lively and a little noisy without being too loud. This would be a good spot for families since kids likely wouldn't be heard by surrounding tables. 

The menu offers a great variety of food items. They have a large list of appetizers, pastas, tacos, burgers, salads, pizzas, entrees, and desserts. They offer light options as well as heartier meals. 

Our waitress was pleasant and attentive. She was around checking on us frequently and made sure we had drink refills. 

Chicken Lettuce Cups were a delicious starter. The mixture of chicken, hoisin sauce, and vegetables worked well together. Asian Shrimp Pasta was my choice of entrée for the evening. Everything in this dish was great and the peanut sauce was very tasty. The peanut sauce did make for a very rich dish so I'm not sure I'd order this again, but it did taste great. My husband went with the Spicy Italian Sausage and said it was a good pizza.

VERY comfortable and unique.  Had a good view of the TV, but you have to turn your head slightly.  Service was a little spotty as the bartender was busy.  This is why I usually don't sit in the bar area at restaurants when I am dining.  However, once I ordered, my food was out very quickly.

I had the sliders with fries and added gorgonzola cheese.  Fantastic.  The bun is soft and toasty and did not fall apart.  This was particularly impressive as the burger was JUICY.  The patties are flavorful.  I could use a little more of the sauce, next time I order them I'll probably ask for more on the side.  The fries are good, thin and crispy with some nice seasoning.  

Cool design and atmosphere with a comprehensive menu.  We'll definitely come back."}

My friend's step-mom recommended this place. Had dinner here on 12/20 with my friends. I was already impressed as soon as we were seated because they sat us at one of the best tables they had. The hostess sat us at the corner table that had a huge comfy couch. Our table was really nice because we had a view of the street and it was super super comfortable. Our server's name was Anthony (I think). We had wine questions and he was very helpful. After our drinks came we decided to start on their Mediterranean Dip Sampler and they were really amazing! My friends and I ordered own entrées and we were not disappointed at all with what we ordered. Then, as soon as we finished our meal and started talking about dessert our server placed a huge complimentary sundae on our table. The Messy Sundae is a must have because it's like being a little kid again. The sundae was a tall plastic wine glass that had vanilla ice cream in it with caramel and chocolate all over the whole thing topped with whipped cream. It was sooooooo good! 
My overall opinion:
I really like the ambiance of this place. Their furnitures are comfortable. I have no complaints at all about the service our server did a very good job. Their menu looks great. The price range is pretty reasonable. They have a decent wine and beer selections. For a place that opened just a few months ago, I think they are doing a pretty good job. :)"}

After I had written my letter in June 2015, I reluctantly hoped that the level of service would rise and match the pleasant dining atmosphere and the great food that Sammy's has to offer. Indeed, we had not frequented Sammy's for over a year, thinking that instituting some necessary changes would take some time. Several months ago, we decided to return and were very pleasantly surprised that the level of customer service had improved a great deal. But, after several satisfactory visits, we found yesterday that things at your Henderson location had really not changed at all.

Yesterday evening, Saturday at 5pm, we were promptly seated at our table by a very friendly hostess, who recited the standard line that "a server will be with us right away." This section of the restaurant was empty when we arrived and we were seated very near the hostess's reception desk and in plain view for all to see. During the 15 minute wait time, we witnessed some very astonishing events.  First, the hostess, who had seated us, seated an elderly couple next to us. As she walked by, she had not noticed that we had not been greeted by any server. Second, the busboy who was preparing a table for 12-14 next to us, walked by twice to move chairs and a table needed for the larger group. He also had not noticed that no one had greeted us. Third, and most disappointing of all, the manager on duty would never have noticed us because she was very busy displaying her new manicure to the hostess. After 15 minutes of holding menus and not being offered a glass of water in an empty section of the restaurant, we concluded that no one cared whether we stayed or departed. So, we departed Sammy's, disappointed once again. Our departure triggered a reaction that was totally unexpected. The manager with the fresh manicure ran after us in the parking lot. Apparently, someone had alerted her that we had left and she confronted us, mumbling something about inviting us back in, and taking care of something..... By then, we had decided to eat elsewhere.

I need not remind you that we have very many dining choices in the area. Our favorites are Elephant Bar, Black Mountain Grill, Pin Kaow Thai, and Kabuki. Please direct your attention to Pin Kaow on Eastern Avenue, which we started visiting recently. Their customer service is outstanding. The hostess is constantly attentive to the dining customer's needs. You should take some lessons from her.

Hello Mr Ladeki:
Hello Mr Anthony Kulick,
Hello Ms Joanna Train,

It is again very unfortunate that we were sadly subjected to a disappointing dining experience as a result of the mismanagement and lack of training of your service personnel. My email with similar concerns which I had sent last year was apparently ignored by your executive team as my family and I have noticed no discernible difference in the quality of your service. This is not to say that the wait staff is in any way rude or unfriendly. They are polite and cordial, but they are at a distinct disadvantage if they are not trained properly and therefore robbed of the opportunity to sell more product, generate more revenue, and earn more gratuities.

How can it be that on a Sunday around 5:15pm, when the Green Valley restaurant is at my best estimate one third full, when there are at least 8 or 9 servers all running in different directions including past our table MULTIPLE times, when there is one very clueless onsite manager running all around, and within the entire 15 minutes after being seated and reading menus, that NO ONE, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, can take responsibility and assume the duty and obligation to greet us at the table and assure us that our server will be with us shortly? Within those 15 minutes, NO ONE even asked us if we wanted water on a day where the temperature outside was 108 degrees!! I am sure that your very inattentive wait staff was very, very busy doing other things in preparation for the evening crowd, but this lack of a simple greeting is unacceptable.

I know 15 minutes is not a long time in the scheme of world events. But some patrons know what they want when they sit down. At the very least, they know what they would like to drink. Perhaps you should convert the restaurant into a self-serve establishment and eliminate the need for staff and a clueless onsite manager.

Please do not offer your phone number to "discuss my concerns." I do not care to be offered any special treatment because I raise these issues. When I walk into a restaurant and have minimal expectations, I expect them to be met without having to write a long-winded Yelp post. Certainly I have better things to do with my time than to bring these deficiencies to your attention. 

We left Sammy's and wandered over to the Black Mountain Grill, where we were greeted by the server within 60 seconds of being seated. What a world of difference!

Perhaps you should visit Black Mountain Grill yourself and observe their operations."}

Our Server JULIA, honestly made us feel we were her only customers and the place was packed. She not only gave GREAT customer service, but an attitude that made us feel like we mattered and we were welcome, she didn't treat us like we were just "another table". She small chatted with us, which was nice and unexpected, and her GM, Rick, came by later at the end of our meal and made sure everything was to our standards, and we were satisfied. I cannot sing enough praise on both of their behalf, and to the rest of the staff. Great dining experience, great food, great time!"}

Specialty is gourmet wood oven pizzas and massive salads. Very comfortable, open air room - if you can figure out how to get to the front door! 

In depth review: very familiar with this Vegas Valley chain and decided to try it out on a Monday night. After a few minutes of navigation through the adjacent business park trying to figure out how to find Sammy's parking lot and entrance, we walked in and were surprised at how busy it was. Bar had a good crowd for MNF. After waiting a couple minutes we were seated at a large table / booth towards the front (facing Green Valley Parkway). It was a chilly Monday night and they did have one of the sliding glass walls open. I enjoyed the fresh air but my lady was cold (as usual). So bring a sweater or jacket if you go in Fall / Winter season at night. 

Service was prompt. Our waiter was still trying to master the little touch screen they use to take orders. He suggested a flatbread appetizer that comes with three different Hummus style dipping sauces. So we ordered that along with a margarita pizza and a grilled shrimp salad. Explained to him that we wanted the pizza and the salad brought out together as our entrees and that we would split them. So we wait about 25 minutes (too long) and finally our flat bread and dip came out to munch on as an appetizer. As soon as I reach for it another runner arrives with our entrees in hand. Was not too pleased and explained that we just got our appetizer and please take the entrees back. For some reason many quality places in Vegas have this issue with timing and seem to want to turn tables as fast as they can?!

Waiter comes back and apologizes. Blames it on the kitchen (obviously). Either way, we enjoy the appetizer and the entrees come out later. They were great. The salad was massive and could easily feed 2 - 3 people. The pizza was cooked perfect and blew similar style at a CPK or Settebello out of the water! 

We were too full for desert but I could see the tables around us ordering them and they looked delicious. Actually they looked massive and could easily be shared. 

Really not going to hold the issue with timing against them. They are a new spot and obviously need to work out some kinks in their operation. Our waiter was super polite and we think he will be just fine as soon as he masters that touch pad. He did comp the appetizer and our drinks. Manager never came to table to apologize but we are sure he signed off on the comp. Also did not get a good night when we walked out and past the hostess - but thats OK. 

We will be back. It's a really nice casual spot and very reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you. Great location and it should do just fine."}

HALF OFF all their appetizers....HALF OFF all of their speciality drinks( very generous pours) ......really.. And the food is very  good.

The food is terrific! It's always such a treat to see a whole wheat crust pizza option. The salad portions are huge. Seriously, huge. My only wish for them is that there'd be a smaller/cheaper salad option that I could add on to my meal. 

I just love the ambience of this restaurant. It's modern but comfortable. Little to no area to hang out, though, while you wait to be seated... That awkward moment when you're standing half inside/half outside unable to close the door as you wait to be greeted by the hostess. 

The service was incredible. They accidentally made my pizza with a regular crust instead of the wheat that I'd ordered. They quickly brought me the correct pizza despite saying I'd just stick with the wrong one and took it off the bill to make up for my "troubles". That is seriously the way to retain loyal customers! Kudos, Sammy's. 

Can't wait to go back and try some of the tapas from the half off menu at happy hour!"}

And hey, I hit 4-of-a-kind twice here, so that's pretty awesome. Happy hour is 4-6pm and has multiple small appetizers and drinks on special. The apps are smaller portions than the regular apps, so you aren't exactly saving a bunch of money.

Decor and Vibe

This was a very cool "mature" version of Sammy's which I am used to living in California. They had these great open windows that actually slide open to open up to the outside so the entire restaurant became almost a patio. Beautiful decor, with very cool fire pits for groups. 

Food

Loved how many healthy options were on the menu. My wife is super picky and gluten free. We shared a Mediterranean plate, a balsamic chicken salad and Mahi Tacos.. all around deliciousness.  

Service 

The server was very helpful and gave us great information for their $10 lunch special that we couldn't do because we were there later than the timeframe, but it sounded great.

Parting Thoughts

This is a great spot to bring a business meeting, an event, a date.. definitely sophisticated and affordable. Wish they had one of these in San Diego!"}

This spot is close to home and I like the ambiance inside of the restaurant. It has a sort of Florida feel.

The brunch here is great. The menu has a nice variety of options and all of the food is really good. I love the small plates here, especially the Lettuce Cups, Lobster Mac & Cheese, & Edamame. They also have a Raclette & Potato pizza that I enjoyed. It was a thin crust pizza with potato and cheese. It didn't have a traditional marinara pizza sauce making it a little different. Different in a good way. The Salted Caramel Pudding for dessert was one of my favorites too.

Now on to the reason why I don't come here anymore despite the fact that I love the food, ambiance, and location. The service was always a miss. The bad service was the most consistent thing that they do at this location. From slow service with disappearing servers to dirty dishes that sit on the table and aren't cleared I just got fed up. Since I liked the food I kept coming back, but ultimately the bad service started to mar the experience and I just couldn't keep coming here. I can deal with mediocre service for good food, but not awful service. The tables here are tiny and the tapas style lends itself to many plates. I found that we were always trying to clean the table ourselves since nobody would clear plates. Every.single.visit. The final straw was when we came in a group at my suggestion and I felt really embarrassed for even recommending the place.

So, the food is good, but you have to be able to tolerate slow and inattentive service to enjoy yourself here."}

We felt bad but we just grabbed our drinks and made our way to the bar, as she was taking way too long. The table next to us even noticed our irritation, as they sat there with the same irritation because they had been sitting for a while without service too. As we got up and moved ourselves to the bar, that table next us got up and left the establishment. We obviously told the bartender why we moved and he apologized but hardly had any urgency and the manager was even right there and she didn't even care! It was a rather lengthy late night dinner and we're definitely disappointed, as we always are when we leave Sammy's. Can't come here when I'm in a hurry that's for sure.

This one is by the the most visually appealing. The lay out is different than all the others. They have a wonderful bar area next to a full glass window wall that opens up, the fresh air is great reminds me of California style restaurants.

Appetizers : Asian style calamari ( very unique) I highly suggest this. 
Hot Rock: 600 degree rock in a bed of salt, and you get to cook your own beef on it. Very tasty and interesting. Also we had Vietnamese crab stack. That was really good and fresh with real crab, and a little lemon grass ginger flavor.

Had a glass of Pinot and the shrimp and grits . Very good, not something I would ever order, I was being spontaneous that day. The waiter suggested it and it was a GREAT suggestion.The grits are not like grits at all, not a single gritty grain actually. Made very well with a stack of steamed greens.

Our waiter was very nice. His name was Zack. Its rare you find people who actually enjoy their job. There is nothing that makes your food taste worst than a fake good mood. We certainly didn't get it with this guy. He is much appreciated, and made my birthday great.

I love the new location, and will be back regularly."}

We wanted to bring our neighbor here since he doesn't live here full time.  He's a 'smooth' talker.  He walked around the restaurant, saw the huge corner table was empty and immediately went to the hostesses to ask for that table.  It was reserved but they hadn't showed up yet and were late for their reservation.   One of the managers said if they didn't show up in 5 minutes the table was ours!   Lady luck!  They sat just the 3 of us at this huge comfy table!  Nice!

Kimberly was our fantabulous waitress!  She was bubbly, attentive and just plain awesome!  We kept trying to talk her into joining us for our meal.  Of course she was working and couldn't explain that one to her boss.  But she was a delight for our entire dining experience.  

Hot Rock appetizer anyone?  It was so good the first time and was just the same this evening.   The steak was full of flavor as we cooked it to our enjoyment.   This will probably be ordered every time we visit Sammy's.   Delicious!

We decided to go family style and split everything we ordered.  This included the Kobe beef sliders with fries and the Hawaiian Pizza.  OH MY!    Full of flavor and perfectly cooked describes both of the items to a T! The thinly sliced pineapple on the pizza instead of chunks gave the pizza an all over evenly hawaiian pizza taste!  I loved this way of preparation because sometimes you just get all pineapple on one piece when it's in chunks.   Hawaiian Pizza ~ A+ !   The 3 kobe sliders were cooked to our liking (medium rare) with cheddar evenly melted on top.  Sometime even the more simple burgers can be the best! 

Sammy's is definitely an asset to Henderson and I can't wait to go back again.  The food and service are definitely top notch!"}

They offer pizzas with whole wheat or thin crust. If you ask, they will thin out the wheat crust for you too-my favorite. They also let you add or change toppings. I love to take a great veggie pizza and add some pepperoni.

Very happy with the way they pulled off these events given the size of the crowd. Pricing was fair for food/drink. Service was very good - not rushed or wanting. Each pairing event had a rep for drinks that went around to each table and a brief run down of the food plates by the chef.

Just couldn't give 4 stars since I consistently witnessed all team members "getting it done" and the reps helped give that VIP feel. 5 stars EARNED.

The only downside is how loud it is. The kitchen is not closed off so that creates a lot of background noise and the restaurant doesn't have sectioned walls for seating so noise is traveling throughout.

Really like the indoor yet outdoor feeling of the "patio" dining area.
I love their patio dining atmosphere... open, airy and just all around fun... like being in someone's solarium.  The groupings of tables and "booths" which are overstuffed chairs/couches is really nice.

I'm thinking this would be a nice place for happy hour... not dark and closed in like some places... this is light and open.  

Their salads are big enough to share.
Their Mediterranean appetizer trio is awesome... love it!  
The chicken lettuce wraps are filling if you happen to get them as an entrée like I did.
Well... ok... so I was full after eating most of the appetizer and then my lettuce wraps.

Next time.... if I go with my mom again... we'll order 1 salad and 1 Med appetizer and that will do us just fine.

Note... don't order a Bellini... they don't make it with peach puree or peach juice... it just came out as sparkling wine.  This was a miss."}

My family and I ate at the Henderson location about an hour ago (currently 3:54 PM) on May 9th. My brother ordered the goat cheese pizza and bit down only to find a SCREW attached to a plastic frame baked into his pizza. A manager was called over and she proceeded to take the plate and didn't acknowledge  that there was a literal SCREW in his food. Not only could he have choked but he could have bitten down and had a screw in his gums. She took his pizza off of the bill and gave us a "birthday dessert" but she should have covered the entire $80 bill! We spent so much money to have a good time and our appetites were ruined within minutes. I want to speak to the higher ups because apparently the day managers don't know how to handle potentially dangerous situations correctly."}

The grilled chicken balsamic salad cravings finally got the best of us, and we decided to venture out and find the next closest location. We were immediately impressed by the new space. There were some more traditional seating options along with some tables surrounded by big, fluffy couches. We were seated at a corner table surrounded by a long, curving couch and we began our wait. 

We waited for long enough for our server to greet us that we started to question whether we should go somewhere else. Just as we were getting up to leave, a server, Jules, hurried over to see what was wrong. She insisted that we stay and promised that they would take care of us. 

And take care of us they did! Jules was really friendly and engaging. I got the feeling that she was providing excellent service because it was the way she operated rather than just because she was trying to smooth over a rough situation. At her suggestion, we ordered an array of happy hour tapas rather than the individual meals that we were familiar with. It turned out to be great advice. We would definitely go back during happy hour because it was so much fun to try so many different little tasty treats. 

The rest of our experience was fantastic. The manager came over multiple times to make sure that we were satisfied. It took a little while for desserts to come out as the dinner crowd arrived, but it was a totally reasonable amount of time to wait for how busy it had gotten. The messy sundae was well worth the wait though. It was just as much fun to play with as it was to eat! The manger came by one more time to see us off and make amends on the check. We'll definitely be back."}

The food is always delicious and the atmosphere is beautiful. However the last few times I've been in it seems like the staff is getting smaller and smaller.

We went on 11/17/15 and sat at tables to the right (as you walk in the door) of the bar. The food was terrific and I would not hesitate to go there again for that reason.  The reason for the low star is our waitress. She was curt to the point of being rude.  My gal asked for the Orange-Horseradish sauce as an addition to her salmon, and the waitress say it's not horseradish sauce, it's Orange Marmalade. My gal asked her (very sweetly I might add) to check for her as it's delicious and she's had it before with the coconut shrimp.  The waitress brought her Orange Marmalade with no horseradish mixed in.  We went ahead and ate, then my gal asked for the menu and she, sweetly again, showed the waitress what she was talking about and the waitress said "Well, we call it Orange Marmalade" and walked off.  I wish I had my receipt for the gals name, but alas I don't.  When I come back we'll go there again, but I will refuse service from this rude brunette."}

I wasn't necessarily hungry but I had no choice. We normally go to the Sahara location and it was my first time at this location which is close to my aunt's house. I love the interior...classy-looking for a pizza place. 

My favorite is their goat cheese pizza but that's what I always get so it was time to try something different. We got the brie cheese and truffle oil thin crust pizza, wagyu burgers and mini kobe beef burgers.

Brie Cheese and Truffle Oil Thin Crust Pizza:
I love brie and truffle/truffle oil. Our server warned me this was going to be very truffly and fragrant - it was not the case. The brie was strong enough to subdue the truffle oil a bit. 4/5

Kobe Beef Sliders:
The beef patty was juicy. The gorgonzola was great with the burger. Comes with fries. 3.5/5

We had a few family members with very specific requests which were all granted. So, I can't complain. The service was great. Their menu seems it has more items compared to the Sahara location."}

Duck tacos
Garlic bread 

All the apps were on point.   The main dish not so much. Ordered the Alfredo and it was runny and watery.  But staff was gracious enough to replace it with spaghetti which was pretty good.

I love the ambiance of this restaurant; the openness of the atrium room is really inviting and more importantly- they play good, hip music. 

During Happy Hour, the mixed drinks are 50% off with majority of the drinks being around $12. The wine is $2 off and beer $1 off. Happy Hour runs from 3-6p, 7 days a week- not too shabby. Also, the appetizers are on sale!m during Happy Hour. 

My friend ordered the mini duck tacos, which she said were fantastic. The duck has great texture and the veggies sprinkled on top were nice and fresh. For her main course she tried the Wagyu Mini Sliders. These came with the lettuce/tomatoes and onions on the side with a huge side of crispy fries. The Wagyu Sliders were nice and juice +the cheddar slice on top- perfect! 

Tonight I tried the Shrimp Angel Pasta. The lobster cream sauce atop this is so creamy and delicious. It also comes with artichokes, mushrooms and zucchini slices. Not too heavy, yet filling! 

As much as I want to give 5 Stars, unfortunately there was a mix up in the kitchen and our food took longer than expected. Two other tables nearby (which walked in after us) revived there food way before us. Also, I would liked our server to check in on us more than what we experienced tonight. 

Other than that, I liked how the manager remembered me from my Yelp Elite Week experience from two weeks ago! He walked up and said, "your back!" That's cool he remembered me!"}

My friend had the Chicken Hummus wrap, I looked over and the plate was clean so I have to assume it was really good! ( I mean the plate even look licked clean!!!)

The drinks had a nice punch and mixed correctly so I could enjoy my meal and not be overly buzzed. The food well the Kobe sliders were nice, the pizza under whelming with first try cold. That was not my gripe, for the true downer to the attentive patron was the manger chewing out in slient fashion the bartenders for a issue with the togo's and taking out $10 from their tip jar. My business opinion, since I own three, is to have dedicated personal for Togo orders. The bar was super slammed with just restaurant business. The star of the show was the service at the bar and the sweet hostess whom picked up my fallen coat from my stool on more then one occasion. The empathy is there with the staff, and so I will be back tomorrow to try something new on the menu, for I recommend this place."}

Is it a great atmosphere for friends, family, drinks, and decent food? Yes.
There is nothing above and beyond about Sammy's, except maybe the great service. Every time I have ever dined here, I am pretty blown away by the attentiveness of the staff. 
I also really love the ambiance. You can sit at the bar and watch the game, dine at a normal booth or table, or in nicer temps, they have opening glass doors to a beautiful garden area. If you sit on that side, the booths are more like couches. Perfect for a larger group, or family dinner. 
There are a few menu items that stand out to me. The mini duck tacos, the lobster mac & cheese, and as small as it may seem, the freakin' cheesy garlic bread is pretty bomb. The salads are huge, and the pizza is decent. 
Plenty of selections, including unique options like lamb, and meat cooked on a hot stone right at the table. 
All of the desserts are to die for. Even the huge plate of cotton candy that is enough sugar for 10 kids! 
I will continue to dine here, but it will never be my first choice. Unless it's for cocktails. Great selection.
Props to the entire staff for being awesome."}

There were about 8 people at the bar, the bartender said hello as we walked to our table. There were 4 tables dining.  We were told Heather would be right with us. After perusing the dinner choices on the menu Heather arrived. She asked if we would like anything to drink. I had flipped my menu over and as I was deciding between the house chardonnay and the Clos du bois Heather apparently grew impatient. She said I'll get you some waters in a clipped tone. Not more than 45 seconds had transpired since she had arrived at the table. We said water would be great thank you. She arrived back with the waters and said she would come back if we hadn't decided on entrees. We then ordered the crab and artichoke dip. She did not ask if we wanted anything other than water. I felt as though she was judging us, our appearances, and our financial status.  When she came back from placing the appetizer order I ordered a wine and we placed our dinner order. The appetizer was tasty and we enjoyed it while mulling over what Heather's issue might be. While waiting for our entrees we heard a plate clatter to the floor in the direction of the kitchen. We joked that it was one of our dinners considering the amount of time that had passed. 5 or more minutes later Heather comes to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later she tells us my sliders were burnt on the outside so the kitchen was remaking them.  I work in Hospitality as a Supervisor for a large corporation and have heard every excuse for a long ticket time there is. Blaming the kitchen is a servers go-to excuse. Once the food arrived we were for the most part satisfied with it, but still slightly put off by Heather's demeanor. She was not friendly, nor did she attempt to engage in any manner. We were one of her two tables she was serving at the time. We ate quickly and when she came to clear the plates she asked if we wanted dessert. At this point I had decided against dessert not because I didn't want have dessert but because I didn't wish to be Heather's guest any longer. She brought the check, I placed my card in the book and she offered mini doughnuts to go on the house. Too little too late. I'm not saying we will not dine again because the food was enjoyable once it arrived, I am simply hopeful that should we dine again we get a server that enjoys their job and puts customer service first. We left Heather a 16% tip which was generous considering her service."}

Usually this place is on point with their salads, pizza, and happy hour.  But last night was such an exception that I felt I needed to write this poor review.
First of all, they were out of skinny margarita mix.  On a Friday night??  Really??  So, I settled for a Moscow mule which showed up in the wrong glass.  Our server said it was because they didn't have any more copper mugs.  As I drank it, I found something in my ice.  It looks like the stem of something...but it was frozen in the ice....so it must have been there for a while.  The server apologized and said she would have another drink made for me.  This one showed up in the right glass!  So they were or they weren't out of them??  She explained to me that the "thing" in my ice was a part of the mint.  It was definetely NOT part of the mint.  But whatever...I'll move on from the drinks.
The Kobe sliders were ordered medium and showed up well.  The flatbread was greasy.  The Chinese chicken salad was spicier than normal, and the New York pizza was awful.  
The service was ridiculous.  We could see that she was busy and I noticed managers running food, but we were there for 2 hours and the service never got any better.  We had no silverware at one point, no water for 20 minutes.  I usually give servers a break because I used to be one....but it was bad.  Not bad enough for me to call the server out online, though.
In conclusion, I won't be returning to Sammy's for a good long while.  It's too bad, too, because it used to be great.  Hope they work out their "kinks" soon."}

I placed the order 5 days in advance AND reconfirmed my order the following day, to ensure event day would go off without a hitch. On the day of the luncheon, Sammy's arrived 15 minutes late and delivered a completely wrong order for only TEN (10) people. I was so humiliated. All 30 executives had to CHANGE the board meeting agenda so they could eat an hour later, when the rest of my order was delivered. I then asked for a receipt for this second delivery, but Sammy's said there was no receipt since they were going to take these 3 trays of food off the bill anyway, but lo and behold, they charged my card for 2 additional trays, without me signing for the receipt. What a bunch of sneaky liars! Honestly, no monetary amount could have made up for the humiliation I endured while the CEO and the rest of the C-Level executives were waiting around for food. I seriously wanted to hide under my desk. It was my time to shine as event coordinator, but Sammy's completely ruined it. Needless to say, I was and still am traumatized by the incident and never again will I put my job in jeopardy by ordering from this restaurant for any upcoming company events we have. After all, there is a sea of restaurants around Green Valley that offer good food, outstanding customer service AND would value my business."}

Not sure why they would even think of having the guest struggle walking let alone that distance, when we were standing next to available tables.
The waitress was prompt & courteous, took the order, received drinks, food was fantastic!
Than she disappeared. The rest of the meal no service was to be had. Just plan awful. Could not even get our check without tracking her down. Once we had the check she never came back to pick up the payment.
For that reason it will be along time before I go back to this establishment. They really need to step up the service to at least OK instead of horrible!"}

I asked the host if my boyfriend and I could park our bikes near the window so we could keep an eye on them. If course I forgot my bike lock. Thankfully they did not have a problem with it. 

The bartenders are very polite and never rushing which was nice since I'm very indecisive. I sat and hung out for a while and tried a few items. Lobster mac n cheese really weak. I make better mac n cheese at home.  The fries are really good but make sure you order a side of ketchup or two if you like to dip it. The Kung Paw Calamari is more like steak calamari. It is really good so definitely try it. I was not impressed with the Crab & Shrimp dip. The bartender let me try the watermelon cooler which was not good. Nothing exciting about that which I was bummed cause it sounded refreshing.  It is convenient to grab a bite or a drink late night or a happy hour but not if I want a good meal.

There are giant windows surrounding the outside of the restaurant giving it an open feeling. The booths and tables have different chairs and set ups than the usual setting.

But there is absolutely no place like Sammy's. If you've seen Cheers, the gaming bar is precisely that type of atmosphere. Everyone knows your name, your story, and you know theirs. If you're looking for a place to be a regular, this is the place. 

Jamie and Chris are THE people that put all of us regulars together and created a strong sense of community. Jamie works Friday through Monday nights, Chris works Tuesday through Thursday nights. COME. THESE. NIGHTS. I, Jamie and Chris, and all the other regulars will welcome you with open arms. I'm writing this as I am currently bonding with the rest of the crew and Jamie. He is immensely professional, all the while making you feel at home. Having an amazing relationship with guests is key and both of them blend that immaculately with professionalism.

We were raving about the great promotions Sammy's has had in the past, and management informed us that Jamie was actually the one who came up with many of the ones we were raving about! I work in Corporate Marketing for Caesars Entertainment and part of my job is to create promotions to keep our guests coming and generate revenue. My executives and I (who I introduced to Sammy's and love it as well!) agree that we would LOVE to have Jamie on our team, THAT'S how good he is. Chris is just as exceptional, and all of us regulars agree that we would follow both of them anywhere. My parents introduced me to Sammy's 4 years ago around their grand opening (they are as much of regulars as it gets and visit Jamie and Chris at least 3 times a week) and this is where I happily spent my 21st birthday week two years ago with both of them. They're like my big brothers!

Thank you for all the amazing memories you give us each and every visit, J & C. YOU are the true epitome of service at its finest. Cheers to the many years to come!

We worried because this is  usually a very busy time, and they were very busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes outside, which was not bad at all. However, there is no place to wait inside, especially on a busy night and they need to hand out buzzers so the hostess doesn't have to come out and yell names aloud. Luckily it wasn't cold outside, so waiting was not bad at all. I'm sure they will eventually get the buzzers. 

Our server was very personable and gave good service. Our tapas appetizer of three different hummus dips with some sort of warm yummy pita bread was so good. It was perfect if you're just ordering a salad as your entrée, because that's what I did and I was totally stuffed. 

My daughters loved their dinners too: BBQ chicken with potatoes and cheeseburgers sliders with fries. I did wish they had something green on the side with the kids meals like broccoli or spinach, but the quality of the food was very good.  I would say the quality of these kids meals compared to other restaurants is better for sure. 

I had my favorite balsamic salad with chicken. I've always loved this salad, but Sammy's needs to not drench it so much in the balsamic dressing. It was very good, but overly coated in dressing.  

Husband had fish tacos which he said were very good. 

For desert, we had the most delicious mini donuts with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce. They were so good, they reminded me of churros. It was just perfect amount of sweet for four people. We loved it!

The ambiance was nice because it's fancy, but not so fancy that we didn't feel weird bringing our kids on a Friday night. We saw several other families with kids in our section, so that was good. You can tell they try to sit families near each other and the on a date and just adults in a separate section. Which is good for everyone because then the people with kids don't feel bad if they get too noisy with the people that are there without kids. 

Of course, bringing kids we had to make 3 trips to the restrooms, which were small, but also very nice. Clean and pretty stone all the way up to the ceiling. 

We will definitely be going back!"}

 The fig & arugula salad is outstanding! It's a perfect balance of spicy (arugula), sweet (fig), salty (feta), and tangy (vinaigrette). That was certainly a highlight of yesterday's visit.

The margherita pizza was interesting. Sammy's interpretation is sliced roma tomatoes and julienned basil on top of melted mozzarella. I usually don't do too many raw tomatoes, but I nonetheless dug it. I'd order it again.

Without a doubt, Sammy's is still one of the top dining spots in Green Valley. If you have any doubts, try any of Sammy's pizzas and you'll understand."}

Was there tonight for a special occasion. because we have always had a wonderful time and great food.  Tonight - and as I can see from reviews on Yelp for the past five months that validates tonight's experience - service was an absolute disaster.  Appetizers took way too long to come out. When one if the managers came by to see how we were doing, I made a comment about the kitchen being backed up. He said she would find out what the delay was. Literally sixty seconds later, they came out... along with one entree. Sent that back and were told they would remake it and serve with the other entrees. Entrees came out - 4 of the 6 ordered. Ten minutes later the missing two finally came out after my husband complained to the manager.  Had to send one of the entrees back. These mishaps continued throughout the evening. Though the manager 'adjusted' our bill to compensate for all the mishaps, our semi-absentee waiter and all the other mistakes ruined the evening. And from recent reviews, these types of issues have been ongoing for months. No wonder, on a Saturday night, the place was half empty.  Please Sammy's - FIX THE PROBLEMS. We'll not be back until we see better reviews."}

We've been to Sammy's a number of times before, NYE was the most recent visit, so I was expecting it to be busy. Apparently, the scheduling manager at Sammy's did not! We arrive at 11:15 for our reservation and we're seated quickly. It was clear that they had understaffed. Both managers were running food and there were about 3-4 servers on the floor. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and after 40 mins our food arrived, cold. Imagine a cold Eggs Benedict and a asparagus scramble, not good. I will never send food back usually, but after that kind of wait, the food had better be good. We returned both our dishes to be remade, after another 20 mins our food arrived and mine was a completely different meal! It was so bad it was laughable. I sent that back and just enjoyed the side of pancakes we ordered. Sure, Sammy's removed the meal from the menu, as expected and none of this was the fault of the server, she was slammed with tables, but it's nothing short of poor management. How do you not staff up for Mother's Day!?! On top of this, the food was bland. Something needs to be reassessed here because with each visit it's getting worse."}

We were very excited when we heard Sammy's was coming to the vacated former-Applebee's location 5 minutes from our home.  We went to Happy Hour on Friday.

It was crowded but we still got 2 seats at the bar.  First, the good news:  The Kobe burgers were exceptional, nice touch with the optional Gorgonzola cheese.  We liked the shrimp & artichoke dip, much better than the spinich-artichoke dip we had at the nearby Elephant Bar the night before.  The Thai chicken satays were good with an exceptional peanut sauce.

The house Chardonnay was Grey Cellars, I believe, at the discounted price of $5.50 a glass.  Not bad.  Some of the normal appetizers were half-price.  Again, not bad.

But, as a former bar manager at a high-volume restaurant-bar in Dallas and former restaurant owner, I was shocked by the very poor service at the bar.  This comes from an owner's perspective in that it was so slow and unattentive that a lot of money was left on the table, for the restaurant and the corresponding 20% tip.  

The design and layout of the establishment is outstanding.  The south walls were totally open and the seating was very unique in certain areas giving you the feeling of being at somebody's home.  Fantastic!

The design of the bar did not anticipate any high volume.  The lower inner portion of the bar prevents close interaction from the barkeep with the customers.  They have to lean way over in spots to serve customers at the bar.  The width of the bar is not conducive for good assistance from bar-backs.  It is very crowded back there.  The bartenders are responsible for the high number of to-go orders phoned in.  The bartenders should be selling drinks and food while appeasing the clients at the bar, not serving up bags of already-ordered carryout meals.  

Subsequently, we would have ordered at least one, probably two more rounds of drinks in the time we were there.  We could not get the attention of the bartender to give us our final tab for over 10 minutes.  Even after requesting the final bill, it took another 10 minutes to get our charge card ran.  Again, putting the "owner cap" on, the customer turnover at the bar would be much faster with better service at the bar.  Thus, the restaurant and the bartenders are losing money.

I know Sammy's owner is damn good.  Overall, his restaurants show that.  BUT, I wish he would have given me a phone call asking my advice on the setup of the bar.  

We will come back, but never on a busy night."}

The hostesses' attitudes felt abrasive and rushed. Our server was Anthony and boy were we lucky to have him. My husband being a smart-alec was firing out all sorts of questions about the menu and he answered them with ease. Anthony took us through the menu and highlighted some of the more popular items featured at Sammy's. 

We ordered the crab stack, the dipping sampler and chicken meatballs...YUM!! For dinner we had a HUGE kale salad and a Hawaiian pizza.

Our meal was timed perfectly and we received new plates and silverware before our dinner came out. Everything was spot on. My family and I will definitely return soon with our friends. Maybe even dare to try the messy sundae :)"}

The food was the same as the other restaurants, but the service was atrocious.

There were ~ 8-10 tables of customers, but only 2 servers that I saw working.  I saw 5 servers sitting at tables busy folding dozens of napkins.  Others were refilling the condiments on the tables. Meanwhile, our server took 15 minutes to initially approach us.  Water took another 10 minutes and tasted like it came straight from the faucet, although our server assured us that it was triple filtered.  One bottle of beer came to our table almost 20 after we ordered it!  Out server brought our food out without any serving utensils (we had to ask for it) and one glass of wine didn't arrive until our meal was almost finished.  Instead of checking us, he was busy chatting with his coworkers. The most insulting part of our meal was the 2 employees who were furiously sweeping the floor around us as we ate.

He finally came back and took our orders.  I told him I wanted to start with the chili and either the kitchen was really slow or our server took forever to pick it up and bring it to us.  

Throughout the meal he would disappear for a really long time.  Another table of two came in and were so annoyed they let him know how unhappy they were.

Sometimes it can be annoying to get a trainee as your waiter or waitress, but I enjoyed getting to see a familiar face (and she didn't make any major mistakes while serving us). 

As beautiful as the interior of Sammy's is, there were a few things that needed some work. I originally wanted one of the special 'handcrafted juice refreshers'  but they were unavailable. So I decided to get a mimosa, we were celebrating my birthday after all. Mimosas are listed as $8 on the menu with a $10 all-you-can-drink advertised as a Sunday special... but somehow, my single mimosa was $10. 

The highlight of the meal, for me, was the adorable little donuts that we started with. They were served with chocolate and raspberry sauces and were super delicious. 
The breakfast burrito I got was large, but just ok taste-wise. 

Sammy's staff was generous enough to give me a free dessert for my birthday, the Messy Sundae. It  was rather cool looking but uninspired in terms of flavor and very  difficult to eat.

Overall, I enjoyed my initial visit to Sammy's enough to want to go back sometime. Hopefully some of the kinks will have been worked out by the time I do so!"}

The service has really gotten bad and the food is not as good as it used to be. It took over 15 minutes before a waiter came to my table. He was swamped and was trying to wait on too many tables. I noticed they didn't have any busboys or extra staff to clean the tables. The tables around me still had dirty plates and glasses from previous diners who had left. I understand the waiters were to take orders, run the food and clean up. It's never a good idea to cut back on staff when the patrons are the ones who suffer. It's not a great way to promote your restaurant. My family of 4 had wanted a quick lunch which turned into very long experience. After waiting 15 minutes to be spoken to add another 15 till we got our drinks and then 30 minutes till we got our food, which by the way was not what we ordered. My husband's order was not correct and it took another 15 minutes till they brought out his correct order. The prices have increased every time I have returned and I'm not sure its worth the price anymore."}

We pulled up to Sammy's, with about an hour and a half before closing. The restaurant was empty, and we were bounced between a bidder and a server. Neither introduced themselves, so I don't have names. 

The busser gave us an incomplete drink order. I had to ask two other people for them to finally complete it. When our waiter came by, I asked what he recommended on the drink menu. His answer was that he had just transferred to this location , and he couldn't recommend a drink. .....aren't all Sammy's some what the same? 

After our orders were taken, no one really checked on us. And when they did, they wouldn't clear our plates/ glasses. My sister at one point had three glasses of coke, just piling up. 

For an empty restaurant, I really don't understand. Service was terrible!"}

Some of the menu descriptions don't do this delicious food justice. We were thoroughly impressed not only by the display of exceptional management but also the fantastic server we had who not only made suggestions but also ensured our glasses were never empty and our plates didn't sit for too long. I hope this was not a fluke and I truly hope that Sammy's is striving to improve their customer service. As for us, we will certainly be back and recommend to friends in the GV area.

We got the lentil, prosciutto, and arugula salad (not sure why it's called this because it's not a salad, deconstructed or not), the duck tacos, coconut shrimp, almonds and olives, and lobster Mac and cheese...

The duck tacos and lobster Mac were really really delicious, big hunks of real lobster and good flavor on Mac and the duck tacos were really nice and meaty and crispy. The olives and toasted marconas were really great quality too and I really liked the salad - you know, for not being a salad and all. The only misfires were the coconut shrimp and it wasn't a misfire so much as they were a little boring and a bit over cooked but we were pretty much tearing up the rest ;). The wine we ordered was turned but that happens. The weird part was the waitress seemed to anticipate a problem and almost be waiting to see if we could tell the difference. When we told her the wine was way off she acted like she figured it had gone bad, we kind of looked at each other in surprise at the table. I hate to speculate beyond that because I really loved the meal and casual atmosphere but if you get some less than yummy wine, do us all a favor and vanish it to a land far far awayyyy!!"}

I expected better from a small chain that made good pizza and chopped salads in their other incarnation.  It was not good from the beginning and went downhill from there.  The crab shrimp dip was ok but lacked flavor.  The pita given with it was just plain burnt on the bottom.  The kids angel hair pasta was clumpy and overcooked and the qlwagyu burger was impossible to eat as the bun was soggy and fell apart, the lettuce was bigger than the bun and the onions were not fully caramelized. The burger itself tasted good and that was all I ate. For desert we had the mini donuts. Again these were burnt so badly you could see the black spots.  The sauce was good.  I will say the service was great though and saved this review from being 1 star."}

Grilled duck, with cilantro, tomatoes, fetta and some type of cilantro sauce. Theyre amazing.

It just looked like a local, quick gambling joint.  We were wrong.  We've now been there twice, and both times it was very good.  The first time we had the satay and calamari appetizers.  The chicken satay was cooked beautifully and was tender, but the best part of it was the peanut sauce.  We liked it so much we ordered a container of it to bring home.  The calamari was different than we've ever had.  It was more of a calamari meatball than regular fried calamari.  It was seasoned well and cooked well.  I really liked it, but my wife did not like the texture.  The second time we had the Asian appetizer which included potstickers, satay, and grilled shrimp, and they were all superb.  We also had the Thai salad and the NY pizza.  The chicken on the salad was tender and very good.  The pizza had great taste and was cooked evenly on the bottom, which is better than 99% of the other wood fired pizza places.  We also had one of the best servers we ever had.  Her name was Jess.  She was cheerful, prompt, and had great follow-up even though the restaurant was full and she was very busy.  She saw we hadn't received our food yet and checked on it without our asking.  We appreciated that she didn't give us a personal sob story to increase our tip.  We will certainly go back to Sammy's again."}

That was the first thing I noticed when I read the 411 about  the new Sammy's restaurant. Because when I have 3am cravings for duck tacos or I want a dessert for breakast(which is the very first thing I did on my official visit here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sammys-restaurant-bar-and-grill-henderson?selected=nd2mtwNWS3VTUtSsgh3esw#6toCyEXOe6hYjLnFocaugw) I know very well where to go now!
  
Yes I have dined here 4 times already! Had fun trying out the Brie French toast during the mock breakfast. Had a blast when they hosted the Yelp Elite Event ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-yelps-red-carpet-affair-sammys-henderson#hrid:n04td4eR6icK6Zxru0ZlCQ ) and been back twice now since they officially opened.  It's safe to say I'm a fan.
 
The standouts for me are their tapas and dessert offerings. The tapas menu is pretty unique and has an international flair.  There's Asian and Mediterranean cuisine thrown in as well...or should I say fused together..IE their Duck Tacos! Mini taco shells filled with shredded duck,creamy feta cheese and cilantro. They surprisingly pulled off the combo of ingredients. The Hot Rock is another tapas dish and must try. The beef is presented to you raw  marinated in ponzu sauce. You have to grill it yourself on a super HOT rock that is on top salt rock crystals which keeps the rock heated. I only wish they would give you a little more slices of beef for the amount you pay for this dish. 
 
For desserts, the Sticky Toffee Pudding is wicked good! Sweet moist cake served over a warm toffee sauce that eventually soaks thru. It's paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance the sweet stuff.  Yeah those evil sweets, so best have dessert in the morning so you have all day to burn those calories off! That doesn't help though I was back later for dinner and shared the Messy Sundae with Mr. B.  Caramel and Chocolate sauce, walnuts, whip cream all over the place ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sammys-restaurant-bar-and-grill-henderson?selected=nd2mtwNWS3VTUtSsgh3esw#l1e1s-4NV_6JNx6gDOgvHg) ..need I say more?
 
I also appreciate the focus is on healthy, fresh and organic, like the eggs for the omelet I had were cage free. Yummy Vegetarian, Vegan and Gluten free dishes are also served.  Adding their Baba Ghanoush to my #Meatless Monday rotation.


Atmosphere ..love it! Casual cool and inviting.  The livingroom-like dining area on the right side is the place to be! Its another huge factor that plays into this place for being one of the designated neighborhood places to dine. Its open and airy,  natural lighting during the day. Love the wicker furnishings it didn't feel cramped at all, the floor to ceiling glass were actually doors that slide open and voila!! It converts to a patio! When its not windy they have it opened up. I'm all about dining  al fresco!

The small negatives -  Breakfast was just okay. I did like what I had though. I think the price point for what you get is just a tad much. I'm guessing maybe because the demographic makeup of this area they mainly cater to can afford it. This place for sure is not your "I come here to-get-my-daily -breakfast-burrito- place. Oh and steak and fries $25? That's a bit much too. Other than that, there's enough dishes well worth it. 
 
Service has been great! They are well staffed in all the areas. There was a little wait time to be seated but it was crowded at the entrance.  NOTE: They do take reservations and the manager I talked to also said OpenTable will be implemented soon.  So I highly advise you make reservations especially for dinner time hours.
  
Well those are the deets! I'm sure Ill have more foodporn pix pop up soon enough since you'll find me here often! Welcome to the neighborhood Sammys!"}

Make no mistake though, everything coming out of that kitchen is delicious!"}

I've tried their pizzas, salads, desserts, variety of appetizers, and I've never had anything that really impressed me. The kobe beef sliders is usually what I go for when I come here because they are probably the best thing on the menu. The last time I went here they had a lot of new items and I was pretty excited about them. I tried the empanadas from the appetizers. Being Argentinian, I was interested in seeing what their interpretation of an empanada would be. Sadly, they were not very good. They were definitely not your traditional empanada. It seemed like they were frozen and heated up in a microwave. Needless to say, I won't be ordering them again. The service here is fantastic though, so I kind of wish their food matched the service. 

A few tips: 
If you want bread, you will have to ask for it. They don't provide it to you otherwise. 
The salads here are huge, even for sharing. I would recommend getting the individual sized salad, even if you are sharing it.
If you have the option, ask the hostess to seat you on the right side of the restaurant. This is where they have huge windows that brings in a lot of natural lighting."}

Sammy's has one of the best wine lists in the 'hood, and the pizzas are pretty good as well. I recently had the sun-dried tomato thin crust, and it really hit the spot without feeling too heavy.

For a "neighborhood gaming tavern", Sammy's certainly takes it up a few notches... And that's very much appreciated. Not all of us are heavy gamers, so it's nice to have somewhere to go whenever to grab a nice lunch with a good drink."}

The food is normally awesome however one item we ordered was the Oak Roasted Asparagus.  Usually a very good dish, tonight for some reason it had a bad taste.

The Hot Rock was great as always, the humus plate and truffle fries were good as well.

For dinner everyone had something different from the Oak Roasted Chicken to the Flat Iron Steak, pepperoni pizza, pasta and cheeseburger.  All were good.

The service did seem a little slower then normal however as I said Jules was a great server and took the time to share some jokes with us.  She definitely made the evening and had a great personality.

I recommend this place and if you get Jules, she has a great personality as I just said so have some fun with her.  It makes her job and your meal more enjoyable."}

It was a Sunday and the place was pretty dead, maybe only 2-3 other tables had people. The location is a short drive away from the 215 and in front of some office buildings. 

For my meal I went with the Thin Crust Brie & Truffle pizza. They were offering both brunch options and lunch, but pizza just sounded right to me. The timing of our entrees was a little slow, maybe about 10 minutes from the first plate being received to the last. That was a bit disappointing, but the food was great. My pizza was hot & fresh. I loved the cracker thin crust and it had plenty of cheese.

This location is always clean and the staff is always friendly and courteous.  There is plenty of parking behind he building.

We started off with garlic cheese bread.  Like a cheese and garlic pizza without the sauce.

An Asian sampler - skewers of grilled shrimp, a couple pot stickers with dipping sauce, and a couple skewers of satay chicken in a peanut sauce.

Followed by a mozzarella cheese and pepperoni pizza.

Ended with a Messy Sunday!

Half off all bottles! I was in the mood for some small plate options and this had some interesting things on the menu. My husband and I started with three which would have been enough but decide to squeeze in one more.
Duck Tacos-Great sauce but meat could have had more flavor.

Meditarnian dipping plate-Terrific! Fresh pitas, great hummus and the cheese and sesame so very good.

Pork dumplings - decent with a little crunch which was nice.

Coconut shrimp with orange/horshradish dipping sauce-Amazing! The best thing we had. They should bottle that sauce.

Over all the atmosphere was very nice with comfortable seating, dim lights. Our server was terrific (I think her name was Adriana?). Service was quick, attentive and our wine was very good.

The only reasons it didn't get 5 stars was:
A) The host was slow greeting us at the door. It would have been nice if the servers or bartenders at least greeted us as they past and let us know someone was coming soon.
B) It was just a little pricey for the food. Not too bad, just a little over what it should be I think.

We will be back on Wednesdays for sure!"}

My son ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It came out in a small bowl, nothing at all special. He swore up and down that it was either artificial lobster or maybe even imitation crab  meat. Very small portion, meat was not very good.
Mom ordered duck tacos. Has had them many times before. Evidently the chefs are being pressured to watch food costs. There was nothing more than a tiny sliver of duck meat on each tack. Very chincey. The service was lousy. We had to ask multiple times for dishes to be removed from the table, drinks to be refilled.

I love all of the windows and natural light that brightens up the dining area. Even though it was chilly due to the AC, I loved how clean and modern the restaurant is now. I also heard that when it is nice outside they open up the sliding doors which would be wonderful!

I went to Sammy's for a work lunch break. One friend got the BBQ woodfired pizza, another got the Kobe burger, another person got the sliders, someone who has come to Sammy's often got the duck tacos, and I got the Balsamic Chicken Salad that was gluten free friendly. 

My salad was way overdressed. Painfully overdressed to be honest. The chicken was a little dry too. However, it was still a little enjoyable, but I was sad I didn't get the shrimp salad or the Kobe Beef Chili which were also gluten free friendly. 

My buddy said the duck tacos are always good, never too greasy, and he ate them all! One of the best things on the menu! The BBQ pizza looked good, supposedly tasted pretty good, but not going to lie, he said he has had better pizza nearby. It was a nice portion though and smelled delicious!

The sliders got a thumbs up, but he said to go with truffle fries since the basic fries are just that. Basic. The Kobe burger was delicious (per my fellow employee) and juicy. Good sized portions without being obnoxious. 

Overall, the experience was good. I won't be running back to come here immediately, but I will come back to try other items on the menu. One of the guys in our party say he's never been disappointed, so I'll give it another go! Plenty of gluten free and vegetarian options which is great!

We were celebrating Father's Day with the family. There were 2 open booths, so we asked for a booth & the hostess said she just sat people there & stuck us on a table between 2 large parties. The waiter came by 10 minutes after we were seated & apologized for his delay & took our drink & food order & left. We noticed that no one ever sat at those booths & now there were 2 more booths available so we asked again for a booth & were sat at a booth. Twenty minutes later our food came & was on its way back to the kitchen since our original table was empty & they thought we left the restaurant. We flagged them down & complained to the manager that our drinks were still not out. She made a face & said she'll check on it. The food was good & the waiter added a free dessert but disappeared again & after waiting for 15 minutes for him to pick up our payment, I walked over to the kitchen and handed him my credit card. Worst Service Ever in a restaurant which was mildly busy.
I called the restaurant 25 minutes later & was extremely disappointed AGAIN...

Horrible Customer Service! We left the restaurant angry because of the terrible service on Father's Day & forgot our left over to go bag on the table. Less than 30 minutes later I called the restaurant & the hostess tells me they tossed the bag because no one ever comes back for pick up after they leave the place. 
We eat out a lot as a family & these guys have the worst customer practices of anything I've experienced so far in Henderson, Nevada."}

Markus, the Monday through Friday bartender is truly genuine and probably helps makes the "regulars". He knows his drinks. It would be nice to see the menu change with the season. One last thought... Beware of the shishito peppers; although mild at times (still cooked to perfection) you may get a plate of hot ones! Luckily the amazing peanut based dipping sauce is close at hand to help relieve the mouth. On a side note, the sauce served with the shishito peppers is amazing for dipping their calamari, and pretty much any other vegetable."}

The biggest difference is the location, though. The old Sammy's was hidden away on Sunset Rd, very hard to find. This new spot on Green Valley Pkwy is much more convenient and visible! 

Opening the menu, it looked familiar with the original items, plus a few new additions (or have I just overlooked them?) 

Vietnamese Crab Stack was refreshing, light, and very tasty. Presented so elegantly, my whole table enjoyed it. 

Off the happy hour menu, the Kobe Sliders had rave reviews from my boyfriend & his parents.

I've also enjoyed:
Mediterranean Dip Sampler
Hummus
Oak Roasted Asparagus
Lobster Mac & Cheese
Wok'd Sesame Shishito Peppers
Grilled Shrimp Salad
Salted Caramel Pudding

The food overall is pretty darn good. From their huge salad portions, unique tapas, Brie/truffle oil pizza w/ mushrooms (my favorite Sammy's pizza), or the ginormous Messy Sundae's overflowing goblet, there's many great dishes for every palate and appetite. Plus I ALWAYS appreciate any establishment that offers and labels vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options!

For me the best thing about this Sammy's is the interior set-up. I LOVE their patio area, where you can sit in plushy comfortable couches(with pillows!) which are part of their booths and look out the surrounding windows. It makes it airy, spacious, and welcoming. I can see me eating lunch there frequently if I worked nearby.

The prices are still pretty high, I always thought that. If ordering tapas, it's a shame if you don't go during happy hour, when selected items are half off. 

Service has been a hit or miss here. It seems the first visits, the staff were still getting used to their new operation, so their timeliness was off. It's gotten better though, our last dinner with our parents was awesome! We'll be come back to try their brunch..."}

Thank goodness for the manager Erin, she was very helpful in planning our menu, then when I can hang the graduation decorations, she volunteered to do it for me and everything else. She was a God send!!!
After the graduation we arrived for the gathering and the private room looked amazing and she already had salads, bread and waters all on the table. Plus she decorated the room and looked great.

I enjoyed the atmosphere. It was very calming with all the light woods and fake water tanks. Our server was very prompt and brought us our drinks. I really loved the menu. I'd go back just for the tapas. They all sounded very yummy. We picked the Duck tacos to start with and I got the Shrimp pasta and Joel got the New York style pizza. Wow! The Duck tacos! Yuuuuummmmy! I could have just eaten like 20 of these little bite size tacos. You do get 6 tacos ( I was forced to share with Joel. Hehe) they are filled with grilled duck, a creamy avocado and cilantro sour cream, queso fresco, and bits of tomato and fresh cilantro. Really! What a treat that was. My Shrimp pasta was also so yummy! (I love that I had the choice of whole wheat pasta.) My dish contained huge shrimp, zucchini, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and it was all mixed with a light and creamy lobster sauce. I was in heaven! The $19 it cost was so totally worth every penny! Joel's pizza had mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and Italian sausage with a red sauce. The sauce was full of flavor and Joel loved all the meat that was on it. 

Other then our waitress not noticing the gift certificate and charging our card full price it was a great experience. ( she felt really bad that she messed up) The decor is great, the atmosphere relaxing and the food was on point. It is a bit pricey, but with the level of food they have it's justified. Can't wait to go back and try more of their tapas."}

My husband and I consider ourselves very patient and understanding people but we left Sammy's last night extremely agitated. 

My husband, 19-month-old son, and I arrived yesterday around 5 pm and were seated promptly. The restaurant was still pretty vacant when we got there. Our server, Ramon, came and took our drink order and then vanished. He finally came back 10 minutes later to take our food order. Our food was delivered while it was still hot. However, our waiter never returned to check on us. We finished our entire meals without seeing our waiter. Our waiter finally arrived 15 minutes after we finished our meal and handed us the check (he never asked us if we needed anything else or how the food tasted). He vanished again! Finally, I told my husband to take my son to the car while I waited. Another waiter walked by me and I asked him to take care of our check. He graciously agreed. 

I don't mind waiting longer when a restaurant is busy. However, we never saw our waiter walking around. Nothing irritates me more in a restaurant than when I feel like a "hostage" (can't refill my drink, can't leave, etc) because the waiter is no where to be found!"}

All of my breakfasts there were very good, but a little expensive.  Dinners were also very good and a good value.  I've enjoyed pasta dishes, pizza and dinner salads...and would not hesitate to reorder any of them again.

One thing I do note is that this Sammy's is WAY better than the other Green Valley location that is now closed.  That one had me completely turned off to the place and I planned on never going back.

One other notable thing is that the environment is very appealing here, especially when they open up the sliding glass walls when the weather is nice."}

Reason being I am glad this location was not taken over by a pawn shop, happy ending spa or a needle exchange and also because the food is decent. I repeat. The food is decent. 

My big beef with this restaurant is the service. When I say service I mean the Management. 

I have been to Sammy's on three separate occasions. First time with a fellow Yelper for brunch and I had the breakfast tacos which were good. Not great, but good. Service was on point.

Second visit was at lunch time on a Sunday with my mother. It took our waitress 25 minutes to get us our drinks. I realize how long it takes to get water and how difficult it is. What was even more annoying than our waitress was the fact that they let the patrons who were sitting at the nice bar in the center of the restaurant scream at the TV during the football game. They were tossing back $10 bottomless Mimosas and obnoxiously reacting to every play and startling all of the dining customers who most of them appeared to have just come from church. Not cool especially because this restaurant has a side sports bar where they should have been directed to. Not cool especially because the Managers did nothing at all about it. The Managers stood by the bar and watched the game the entire time, too! Not my idea for a relaxing Sunday brunch. If I wanted this ruckus I would have gone to the sports book!

Third visit I really disliked a pasta dish I was sharing. Took one bite and no more. I mentioned it to the waitress and was still charged for it. Way to keep it classy, Sammy's. 

NOT ONCE IN ANY OF MY VISITS DID THE MANAGERS TOUCH ANY TABLES TO SEE IF THE GUESTS WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR FOOD AND SERVICE.

Lastly, I did not want to write this review.It's my favorite time of year when I pretty much love everyone and everything.  I shared my frustration with their website directly. But, when 2 MONTHS later I did not receive anything more than a generated email response from the Sammy's website I knew I had to let the Yelp family know. I will not be playing it again, Sam I am."}

Mini Duck Tacos-I was very surprised I liked this dish! The duck was crispy but tender. Loved the flavors of the cilantro and feta added with it. It was a perfect appetizer. 

Spicy Thai Grilled Chicken Salad-very delicious, but it wasn't spicy at all. I loved the fresh herbs and the perfectly grilled chicken. Just a little too many peanuts added. 

Sicilian Pizza-So good! I can't believe I never ordered a pizza here before. The crust was perfectly soft and crunchy. Normally I don't eat the crust because it's either too crispy or flavorless without the sauce and cheese but this dough was delicious. I also loved their sauce. It was so fresh with a touch of spice."}

My latest visit was at the bar in the gaming area and I had the shrimp/crab dip & the red quinoa salad (from the regular menu). I was pleased that the bartender gave me both the happy hour menu and the regular menu WITHOUT MY HAVING TO ASK for the happy hour menu! Kudos.
I was impressed with how cozy the bar area is. The white lights around the bar really make the place comfy. The bar chairs, not so much. 
Back to the food- the shrimp/crab dip was disappointing. If you're gonna feature crab, I better be able to taste it! Not so much here. It was served hot and with plenty of flatbread but the flavor just wasn't there. The salad was excellent and very fresh. Loved the beets & avacado, 
Would have again for sure and maybe try some tapas from the happy hour menu next time.
They have gaming promos such as earn 250 points on Mondays get $20 play next visit."}

Was a little hesitant about trying it because every restaurant in that same building has not made it. 

I LOVED the decor and the fact the huge windows opened up especially on a spring night. Side note - they actually went against health code violation because they have the open walls/windows so close to food service and the bar without fly fans.

the wait wasn't long at all and the place was packed, only one empty table. The food was also fast, the fastest of any restaurant I've been to. 

Our waiter though was extremely awkward. He probably didn't know he was and maybe he was new? But the ipad ordering system may have had him confused because once I placed my order (out of 4 people) he sat there and typed trying to punch in my order for literally 3 minutes!!! we all just looked at each other like helllooo, are you ever going to say something like "i'm sorry this is taking so long" or "what I can get for you sir". Nothing, so awkward!!! And the fact he forgot our wine and the manager had to bring it to us was not really acceptable. 

I ordered the chopped chicken salad which was just eh. I might have been comparing it to balboa's (which is amazing) but that's to each it's own."}

My favorite app is the Duck Tacos (not to be confused with the duck quesadilla, not a fan). And who doesn't love the Messy Sundae? 

This location is great, huge open floor plan, bar right in the middle, but my favorite thing about this location is the wall facing Green Valley Pkwy opens up and exposes the entire restaurant to fresh air. I love it! This is definitely a great addition to the GV area. Can't wait to come and try brunch. This place is pretty decent when it comes to chain restaurants."}

She somehow got me invited with a plus 1 to the Sammy's VIP event a few nights later. I love that girl!

This was a complete success from start to finish. They executed this event perfectly. I was greeted at the door and she easily found my name. My friend wasn't there yet, so she wrote her name next to mine and assured me she would have no issues getting in. 

As I walked in I was greeted by more people, one offered me a glass of champagne. I went to the bar and almost immediately someone came up to me to offer a slice of pizza. The flow of the food was perfectly timed. It seemed just as I would finish one thing someone else was offering me a new item. Pretty much every thing I tried was delicious. The pizzas were great. My two absolute favorites were the Goat Cheese (Sautéed mushrooms, garlic spinach and red onion - which I took off) and Five Cheese (Gouda, Raclette, Romano, Mozzarella, and Gorgonzola - perfect). The Garlic chicken was my least favorite, although I did like the BBQ Chicken (Smoked Gouda, BBQ Sauce, Cilantro - I removed the ren onion, of course)

The duck tacos were great. I really liked the tomato/cilantro sauce. Duck is definitely one of my most under eaten but favorite meats. I love when a restaurant isn't afraid to use it. They also had a duck quesadilla that was pretty delicious. I was in duck heaven. 

Some other yummy things that I tried: Some kind of tuna on a cracker - perfect and some kind of fish tacos. Both were good, but I really liked the tuna. The specialty cracker (it didn't really taste like a regular cracker) paired perfectly with the tuna. I could have eaten 100 of those. So good!!

One of the only things I didn't like too much was the hummus. I'm not sure exactly what about it. Maybe I was just stuffed as it was one of the last things I tried, but I think I just didn't like it. 

Even the house red wine they were serving was pretty good. I tried a few of the specialty cocktails and although they were good. I'm not a cocktail girl.

Everyone was so friendly. Great customer service. We sat at the bar the majority of the night and even though the staff seemed very busy they were attentive. The venue is awesome. Large bar right in the middle. There's an atrium style room to one side with large windows. There's also going to be a tavern open 24/7 linked to the restaurant. 

I can't wait to come back on Thursday for ladies night. Ladies drink 2 for 1 8pm to 12am and also to try the mac and cheese, made with Tillamook Cheddar, my favorite!"}

Update: So, I gotta say, what is going on with the music on Sundays? It's like elevator music for hipsters. I just got done listening to an electronica version of Bob Marley's "Is This Love," and I'm pretty sure Bob is rolling in his grave due to that rendition (and listening to it, made me want to join him). 

Now the song that's playing: it's like a song that makes me want to play in traffic or dance the salsa. Either scenario is probable at this point, but I'm leaning towards the first option.

Here's a recommendation, since it's a pandora station from what I believe: Put it on Gary Clark Jr.'s station, and call it good. Some awesome blues would be fitting for the atmosphere. 

You're welcome. Keeping the rating at a 5, even though the music on Sundays is upsetting."}

The menu was very diverse with still the staple of Sammy's (pizzas). Boys got pizza and burger, thumbs up. Asian salad was okay.

I can't believe I have not experienced this spot sooner. I LOVED how many vegetarian and vegan options they offered. This restaurant is so accommodating with dietary restrictions. **bonus points**
Everything was absolutely fabulous. The food, the service, and the vibes. 
I would love to start the review by mentioning how beautiful the restaurant is. It's so airy and bright, surrounded with glass doors that have nothing but beautiful greenery all around the outside. My husband even made a comment that he thought it was a great spot to start bringing clients. I felt as if I was at a resort type restaurant. Such a beautiful beautiful space! 
The service was fantastic. Ricardo waited on us and he was so helpful, friendly, full of suggestions, and incredibly attentive. I loved how well he knew the menu and how willing he was to guide us through it as we made our selection. 
THE FOOD! My favorite favorite part! 
My husband ordered the chicken wings while I started with the hummus sampler platter. My husband loved the wings and platter was divine. I will get it every time I visit Sammy's from here on out! 
We followed our small plates with a Greek salad. YALL. Sammy's does Greek salad right! It was piled high, tossed in the most scrumptious dressing, with an abundance of veggies and feta cheese. I can easily say they have the most impressive Greek salad I've ever seen and tasted. SO DELICIOUS.

We finished our salad and moved on to pizzas. 
Once we took our first bite, we immediately knew we had found our new favorite pizza spot! The crust was so unbelievably perfect. The exact way we love our pizza. Not too doughy, the perfect amount of crisp, and ohhhhh the magnificent sauce. 
We ordered the bbq chicken pizza and the Tuscan. 
I don't eat meat, but I can assure you I know it was good just by watching my husband savor each and every bite. 
I do have to say, I believe the Tuscan was the show stopper. Topped with Roma tomato's, mushrooms, red onion, and Gorgonzola It made for the most unbelievably delicious pizza. In fact, I've been planning my trip back just so I can indulge in the delicious delicious wood fired Tuscan pizza. 

We finished with the flourless chocolate cake which was a deliciously decadent way to end our dining experience. I'm so happy we were informed of Sammy's incredible happy hour with 1/2 off small plates! We WILL be back. Again and again. 

PRO TIP: order the espresso martini! It's a divine secret menu cocktail!"}

Unfortunately it fell a little short for me. However, I am willing to go back again and give it another try. 

We ordered the Mediterranean Appetizer, Waygu burger, pear prosciutto and arugula pizza as well as the toffee dessert. 

The appetizer was delicious. I would order it again, the babaganoush and the cheese were my favorites. 

The Burger - Oh how we wanted to love you. The patty was well cooked and delicious, the bun was a soggy wet mess. It literally fell apart. I will attach a pic of what the bun looked like once we got it. He ended up just eating the burger alone and taking the remains of the bun off altogether. 

The Pizza- Delicious! It was a bit heavy on the cheese but I liked it. 

The Dessert- It tasted pretty good however it wasn't warm at all, not even room temperature. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be warm ... I kid you not 18 minutes later she still said she had no idea. It was confirmed at the end by the chef it should have been. 

Management did comp our dessert which was very nice but not necessary. 

Service- Extremely slow, asked for napkins and we never got them. Had to ask for water after our glasses were empty. Our waitress was nice however she really wasn't around, Multiple people in our section complained about her. We waited about 10 minutes just to get the bill, then the waitress said she forgot and we had to wait some more. 

I'm hoping we just caught them on an off day. I like the ambiance and the location is perfect. Our waitress suggested we wait a couple more weeks before returning because its "crazy". 

We will do just that: be back in November Sammy's."}

There is 4 sections (24hr gaming bar, indoor, regular bar and a "patio" section). We got there on Sunday around 6/7pm and it was packed. There was no seating area so we had stand and wait to be seated. 

We finally got seated after 15min, the waitress got us our beverages and took our order. 

Here is what I think of this place:
- slow service/barely any service
- dishes that are already on the table is dirty (still had old food residue)
- portion size of the pizza is a bit bigger than your typical Sammy's but it's not the same because they do not have a brick oven to cook the pizza. And they didn't use the artisan crust for the Brie cheese w truffle oil "artisan crust" pizza
- prices are a lot higher than your typical Sammy
- it took over half hour to get our food and when we got it, it wasn't even what we ordered so we had to wait some more. 
- place is very loud because if the high ceiling and glass surroundings

All in all my bf and I didn't like the place. We will stick to "our" Sammy's on 215 and rainbow where it's just much more intimate w great customer service."}

The crust was chewy and crispy at the same time. The whole pizza in general was crispy. I'm assuming because I had no cheese. The bf pizza was a little soggy but still great flavor. The server picked up on the fact I don't dairy and was kind enough to let me know the sauce has cheese so she was able to switch it to marinara. Great service, great food, giant beers. Awesome!"}

This restaurant venue is nicely appointed, far more so that I would have expected out of knowing this is a 24/7 VP bar at its core. Truth be told, I never even discovered the gaming area! Continuous floor-to-ceiling windows run three sides of the large, main dining space. I arrived around 6pm on a weekday and the entire space was packed solid. Including a ten-top in the back corner. 

Yes, the menu is mostly about the 'za, but there some pasta plates and sandwiches and such. Many of the items are twisted, such as kung-pao calamari, making for a very interesting treat to the palate. I went with grilled Brussels sprouts (w balsamic & nuts) appy at $9.00, then a 14" sausage & onion pizza at $13.75, washed down with an iced tea at $3.25.   

The Brussels sprouts were very tasty. OK, YOU don't like Brussels sprouts, but I love them. Especially in this grilled format that's turned up on a number of menus in recent years. A tasty alternative to fronting with a traditional salad, also at $9.00. The pizza was fine, nothing in the range of "I gotta message all my BFFs and tell 'em right now," but tasty. My mistake here was to not step into this venue's twisted world and try something like their Pad Thai pizza. 

Then I lucked into a Yelp check-in for a free desert they call a Messy Sundae. I recommend it. And I do NOT recommend it. 

OK, it's really a traditional sundae, you know, vanilla ice cream, choco syrup, some nuts, whipped cream, a Maraschino on top. But this place got really creative and turned it into one stupendous presentation. It's served in a wine glass that's been sitting in the freezer ... and that is set upon a small dinner plate. Instead of putting the choco syrup into the glass, on top of the ice cream, they run it (and the nuts) down the sides of the frozen glass until the plate is puddled in it. Then you can dip your ice cream into the puddle. Then a glorious tall cone of whipped cream protrudes from the glass. I am sure there's pictures of it here; check 'em out. That's why I recommend it. 

Here's why I DON'T recommend it. It is absolutely impossible to eat it neatly. Impossible. I bibbed my lap with an extra napkin ... and still, as I write this, my khakis are soaking in detergent in my washing machine, hoping to get all the choco droplets out of them. These folks WANT it to be messy, that's plain enough, because the give you a long and teeny-weeny spoon to try to eat it with. So no way your choco-spoon ain't gonna runneth over with every mouthful. And you've got to dig deep in that unsteady wine glass to get your ice cream out. And you'll probably be trying to scrape the nuts and choco off the sides of that glass as well. Grab the glass to steady it ... wah-wah, the glass is coated with syrup. It LOOKS awesome, but you'll earn a gold medal trying to eat it like an adult. I didn't take home the gold ... and once was enough for me. Though my shot at glory was free, you'll pay a $10 entry fee to compete. 

My recommended play here is to come in between 3pm & 6pm, when all the apps are half-off. There were at least twenty of them on the menu. Everything from the aforementioned calamari and the Brussels sprouts ... to meatballs, poke, tacos, potstickers, pork dumplings et. al. At half-off, most of them can be snagged at $4.50 to $6.00 each. Four of them would easily make a quite filling four-way-twisted light dinner for two. A much better alternative than racking up a $50 tab in exchange for two personal-sized pizzas fronted by a teaser or two plus beverages.

There's several branches of Sammy's scattered about town, including one inside McCarran. Just more evidence Sammy's is a solid choice.

This unit is just off 215 at Green Valley, at the GV & Pebble intersection, across the street from the strip mall that houses a Smith's and Bank of America & Wells Fargo outparcels."}

If it was half of the price it was offered at I would have been okay with it. taste wise it was good, had lumps of crab meet and a good amount of cheese. I ordered a pizza The New York Style. I thought New York style would at least be cooked through. The crust was crunchy but the middle was under cooked and doughy. not impressed. Not sure what specialty is here since their menu is all over the place. Josie had the Grilled Hawaiian Mahi Tacos. These were fresh and spicy, maybe too spicy for the spouse.

Occasionally the service is less than stellar, and people tend to bring young, loud kids here later than the usual "young, loud kids" hours for family restaurants.  But the food is both sensational and out-of-the-ordinary.

I've been four times, and each time I order two items off the appetizer menu, which is both extensive and diverse.  "The Hot Rock" (spoiler alert!) was a huge surprise, as it's actually a stone heated to an extreme temp and served with raw beef strips that you cut up and heat on the rock itself.  It was an amusing novelty, and it turned out to be really enjoyable, too!  Also enjoyed the crab-and-artichoke dip (even the pita bread is fantastic) and an amazing hot fudge and caramel sundae we got for free because we celebrating a birthday.  Can't rave about the Kobe chili or the chinese chicken salad, but I think it was just a matter of personal taste.

I'd certainly recommend going after 8 on a weeknight or even later on the weekend, but overall Sammy's serves some wonderful dishes and definitely offers something DIFFERENT from the usual fare."}

My first time here a few weeks back was much better, even though the place was packed, we received constant, excellent service. Tonight was a totally different experience. We ordered an app and two pizzas, waited at least thirty-five minutes, app never showed. When the pizzas arrived we asked that the app be cancelled. Our server came back to say the pizzas just cooked faster than our little dumpling app (really??). I can forgive a mistake (like if someone forgets to put our app order in...) but I don't like being lied to. She proceeded to say that it was being cooked and that the manager would swing by and 'take care of it'. We never saw such manager, our server only checked on us once, and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I love the feel of this new Sammy's but one cannot live on ambiance alone. There's a small mom & pop pizza spot down the street from home that always delivers on the service front. I'd rather give them my business no matter how meager it may seem. It would have showed some good character if a manager would've showed up and simply apologized for whatever mistake was made. No need to comp anything, just own up to the mistake, apologize and move on. Very disappointed, I really wanted to love this new location."}

The thing that I don't like about this place, is the set up.

 The host(ess) desk is so close to the doors, that there is maybe about two (2) feet of standing room when you are waiting to tell the greeter how many are in your party. There was at least six (6) of us waiting, trying to find out seat arrangements in a crampy space. This is with the entire restaurant though....even when we were seated. Be prepared to be real close with other people who are eating there.

My guy ran off to the bathroom, and before he even got back, our daughter and I were seated... So, the wait was probably three (3) minutes.

The decor is new, something that I haven't seen before.... Almost an outdoors-y, upscale chic with river rocks....and really nice lighting. The seats were comfortable.

Up comes our waitress (meh). Of course, ordering a beer is easy. I of course, want a yummy cocktail. I ask the waitress which she would have. Between the orange mojito, and the Soju spice. She admits that she hasn't had either, but to get the Soju Spice because "it's different".

I went along with the Soju spice ($10) and I am so glad that I did. 
--Tyku Sojo, Cilantro, Jalapeno, St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, with Sweet & Sour.

 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !MONEY! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

A 23oz Stella was $8.

We were also given two (2) waters, and a nice full pitcher of water. Thank goodness, because that refilled our glasses twice (2), without us having to hunt our waitress down.

We decided to go with the duck tacos for an appetizer (10.50)
Feta, tomato, napa cabbage, tomato-cilantro sauce

I ordered the (fresh, never frozen) Grilled Hawaiian Mahi Tacos ($12)
Tomato-avocado salsa, napa cabbage, Chipotle sauce, flour or corn tortillas

He ordered the Kobe Beef sliders, with cheese (12.50)
Chipotle Aioli (Add gorgonzola or aged cheddar +1)

and a Thai chicken salad (11.50) to share.
Mixed greens, julienned carrots & zucchini, tomatoes, peanuts, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, Thai dressing

The duck tacos came out, and they were quite good. They were in a hard corn shell, and we both thought that they could have used a little more ,sauce on them....The duck is somewhat missing, but the lettuce, tomatos, and feta are ALL over the plate. I mean, it was like having a salad after wards.

Our entrees came, there were two (2) tacos on my plate, and I gave up one for a slider.
The slider was tender, melt in your mouth, and had so much flavor. It was one of the best that I had ever had. 

My fish taco was also impressive. The flavor was outstanding. The fish was cooked perfectly, and so moist. 

We both ordered fries with our meal, and we both asked for a side of ranch. Out with our meals came two (2) sides of ketchup, and one (1) side of ranch......interesting.

The thai chicken salad is the thing that was meh. The chicken was super dry, and even with the peanuts, the salad had no texture, and was just soggy. Definitely not worth $11.50.

With nothing but a few scattered french fries on our plates, we are waiting for them to be cleared, so we can order dessert. Our waitress passes us twice. The manager comes by, asks us how everything was.....we answer and ask for a dessert menu. He also, leaves our plates, and comes back with our dessert menu. Our plates are still not cleared when he walks away.

Our waitress comes by, and finally gathers our plates, when we order the Messy Sundae, ($9)Vanilla ice cream, chocolate & caramel sauce, walnuts, whipped cream.

We send her with our card, and get our sundae.

The ice cream, was not very creamy.... it almost had that freezer burn texture, kind of gritty. The walnuts, in my opinion, ruined it. They had that funny, dirty walnut taste... Another nut could do this dessert more justice.

While finishing up our sundae, our daughter decided to drop and break the sugar dish. Thankfully, management wasn't a jerk about it....
What can I say, we really know how to make an "exit".


We will be back, especially for happy hour!"}

The breakfasts consist of the same Sysco-type food that every other restaurant in Henderson (and Vegas for that matter)  have to offer.  The same frozen potatoes with peppers, small eggs from GMO fed farms (organic cage-free doesn't mean gmo free) and grossly processed meat.  So save a few bucks and just dine at the Grand Cafe up the street for the same low quality.  What ever you do, don't order your eggs scrambled - it's nasty.   Not sure what mix or cream they used, but it was like eating yellow creamy foam.  Never again.  I will drive the extra miles just to get the best breakfast on earth at EAT downtown.

For a place that boasts "gluten-free" options, I was stunned that they didn't even offer gluten free bread for breakfast.  Their juice drinks at $4+ a clip aren't even fresh - rather they are poured from a bottle and/or the equivalent to drinking a Coke.  

Cheap ingredients and originality is very low.  The pizzas could have been frozen for all I knew.  Bland and no flavor.   If you like matzo crackers, then the artisan pizzas are for you.  The salads were wilted and over poured with dressing.

During BOTH visits, the staff refused to give me box for our pizza!  They offered to "box" it, yet BOTH times they ruined two left over pizzas  by wrapping them securely  in aluminum foil!   Who does this?   Do they think  the toppings won't stick to the foil?  Or maybe that people with a nice car don't want food leaking???  When I asked for a "box", I was told, "we don't give out boxes".  Mind you, they give boxes for take out, but if you buy two of the most expensive pizzas and only eat half, you get foil.  I told her that I would pay for a box and so the waitress returned with a plastic container that was clearly too small for the pizza and said "will this do"? Then she walked away in a huff.   The two California investors for this restaurant standing by did nothing.

It is my hope that the CA investors who are constantly on the floor and yet strangely never  interact with patrons, will bring in a few experienced servers from California to demonstrate to Las Vegas waitstaff how the job should be done.  This "i will probably only ever serve you once" mentality is best left for Las Vegas Blvd."}

So on Friday night, we placed an order to go.

We ordered a 5 cheese pizza and were completely disappointed.  I should have known that it wasn't going to be good as when I picked up the box, I had to check to see that there was a pizza in there as it was so light.  The pizza tasted like something you'd get at Cici's or a low chain buffet.  Completely disappointed.

We also ordered the Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad and this was ok.  The chicken was a bit burnt and dry.

We also ordered some Pork Dumplings and they were probably the best thing we ordered.

As for the service, there was some confusion on how to pay for a to-go order when I went to pick it up . . . they were nice enough about it, but just seemed like they still haven't gotten the flow of a new restaurant yet.

I looked at the other reviews and just didn't have the same experience as others had.  Maybe it was an off night . . . maybe the food doesn't hold up when you take it to go.  Maybe we need to dine in and see what we think before completely writing off this restaurant. 

I do know this . . . . If I want to order Pizza to go, I would much rather get it from Metro Pizza.  Hands down!!!"}

Holy cow this place is all kinds of sexy and very modern. Wayyyyy different then the older Sammy's. Sammy's got it's groove on. The wife and I meandered in Wednesday for some happy hour and grub. The place was humping and I was really impressed by the space. It had a welcoming, yet cool hip vibe. They were doing a wine dinner that night so we ate at the bar to avoid a wait. The service was good and the food was typical Sammy's; good price and great taste!"}

Please Sammys hire more servers and/or train them better."}

I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and Wagyu Burger which both had great flavor and totally hit the spot. John greeted me on the phone and took my order. He and I spoke about different selections on the menu. I was surprised at not only how well he knew the menu, but how he was able to suggest items based on the menu items I was ordering. It was nice to talk to someone about the many different dishes. It would take forever to try them all! He was friendly, hospitable and very willing to take care his customers. So Thanks for your help today John! Keep up the great work, we will be back. If you haven't been to Sammy's you are definitely missing out!"}

This place is a keeper.....Try it. Ciao"}

Upon arrival, the restaurant was not busy for the day of the week. After a few minutes of socializing, we were waiting on our server, who looked as if she was consumed with more than she can handle. It took a little longer to get her attention and get in our food to meet the time requirement for the lunch menu special. My friend and I ordered a soup and each a subsequent dish. We both expected the soup to be out as our first course but instead, everything was brought out together. The server was very nice and polite but we felt that the service was a bit slow. The food was good and the atmosphere is awesome, the service, however can be little more refined."}

It was very noisy which made it very difficult to have a conversation.  In addition, the food was lackluster - nothing special. We gave it another shot last weekend and came away very disappointed.  My husband ordered the chicken Caesar salad.  The dressing wasn't blended well and the chicken tasted like they microwaved it. I had the balsamic grilled chicken salad.  It tasted like soap. We complained to the manager about the Caesar salad.  His response was that no other customer complained about it all night and we were the only ones unhappy.  After this reaction, complaining about my salad was moot.  They took off the Caesar salad from our bill, but it did little to make up for such a bad experience."}

The low rating is strictly for a particular bartender. The brunette bartender with the east coast accent has terrible customer service skills. I was there for over an hour and only got one drink, i placed my empty drink on the bar rail in front of me (in front of the machine) and patiently waited for another one. Didn't get it. Wanted to eat... never got a menu. Never offered a menu. There were two gentlemen on the bar next to me by the juke box and they got the most service. They got spectacular service. And she spent quite a while taking with them... guess i wasn't her preferential guest. Fine. 
Then i had someone meet me... and when she came and ordered a drink.. the tonic was flat. After waiting 15 mins to see if the bartender would notice her guest not drinking... or asking if we needed anything (like a menu or players card... which we needed both) i finally told her about the drink. And waited patiently for it while she tried to figure out why another machine wouldn't work....  
I'm a bartender too. So i get when things happen.... but this was ridiculous. I just know now to never come in when she's working."}

Our poor flustered waitress was having to greet and seat guests, serve food and bartend.  Meanwhile, the manager  disappears for long periods of time, prompting the lounge bartender to loudly ask, "where is he???!"
Time for this place to have a deep and meaning staff talk."}

We ordered two (vegan) appetizers: 
-Brussels sprouts without cheese 
-Walnuts & olives

They were totally delicious-- especially the roasted Brussels sprouts with balsamic vinegar!

-Most Pizza crusts are vegan.
-the marinara is vegan, not pizza sauce--it has cheese.
-They have Daiya mozzarella cheese. 

I ordered a pizza with whole wheat crust, marinara, spinach, olives, onions, bell peppers, artichokes & sundried tomatoes. It was wonderful! (I would normally order the vegan cheese, but I am not a fan of Daiya)

The server was wonderful! Very knowledgeable and accommodating. 

I will be back!"}
