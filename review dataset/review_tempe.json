I grew up on meat and lived in Texas and love the taste and texture. I became a vegetarian and always have craved a burger....so my roommate brought me to Green and the Bic WAC IS OUTSTANDING! I can't believe its not meat. The taste was perfect and it had the right texture color and consistency. This is not a vegi garden burger. I love to cook and have no idea how they do this. Just try it and you will be shocked! I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh. I also loved the samosas...much better than my fav indian restaurants...not greesy at all but very crispy!"}

Greens. I love everything I have tried here.

I have tagged along to Tempe several with hubs on "work" meeting trips and I really glad that I did, would have never discovered Greens.

Its funny EVERY time we see our omni friend he mentions the Big Wac (which is a similar version of Doomie's Big Mac only WAYYYY better) at Greens! Super funny, soon I will hear of a omni driving to Tempe via Vegas to get a Big Wac. 

I always get the Buffalo Chkn' sandwich which is similar to Garden Grill. 

Its a cute little casual place and the service has always been fast and friendly.

I really need to try different things when I come here next time.......but our standard choices......always fulfill!!!!

Ordered the Buffalo wings which were small but pretty good (and pretty close to a meaty texture). I ordered the mooshu po boy which was kind of disappointing and definitely not worth the price.

The fact that you can go to a restaurant and not ask your server if what you order is vegetarian friendly is a dream come true!  I go to Green when I am craving vegetarian comfort food.  The spicy buffalo wings and vegan chili fries are a good way to kick that craving.   The no harm chicken parm sandwich is so tasty but watch out it is messy!

The way the restaurant is decorated is so different than most places around Tempe. All along the back wall they have old car doors lining the bottom half. On other walls, they have local astists display their artwork that you can buy. It's just a great atmosphere."}

The temperature situation seems to have improved. I ate there the other day. Like, on site.

The best kept secret in the man-world: the women who work and dine here  are so bloody hot. If you're a straight male human, lonely, longing for the touch of a beautiful woman, eat here. Everyday. You're bound to get lucky, at the very least because positive karma will be catching up with you for not supporting any of the evil industries. 

Original review: 

I love this place. I went twice yesterday. I seriously cannot get enough. As a transitioning vegetarian/vegan, the food here is a dream come true. Everything I've had is amazing. Very tasty. The chocolate and organic peanut butter tsoynami is the best dessert I think I've ever had, vegan or not. But what the fuck is up with the temperature in that place? Vegans like a temperate place to eat as much as anyone. I can't eat in there. It's so hot. I have to get my food to go or only eat there in the winter. I just don't get it. Aren't the employees uncomfortable? How could I be the only one this bothers? That's a wrap is similarly uncomfortable, but more tolerable. All that complaining aside, I cannot recommend this place enough for the food. It's, quite frankly, delicious."}

But first I would like to say that just because it's vegan does not mean it's healthy or organic. Green uses organic ingredients "whenever possible" as stated on their menu. This place is pretty much a vegan's guilty pleasure. 

Orecciette Pasta
The chips looking things they gave me with my pasta was pretty good.
The tomato sauce ...I didn't like it.
The vegetables were chunky and weren't cut good ..but that probably doesn't matter to a lot of people, I just like my veggies cut nicely. 
The little earlobe pastas were good.
The mock breaded chicken ...normal. 

Atmosphere
This place has a casual artistic atmosphere.
They have flyers supporting locals around and they also have Java magazine for anyone to look at and take. 

Employees
Nice, happy employees. I just found it a bit weird that she got a bit tense and hesitant when I asked her about the food like she was afraid I was going to ask about the healthy stuff of the ingredients or something. 

It was worth a first time visit just to satisfy my curiosity but I won't be coming here to eat healthy. Seems like the place for vegans to go if they have occasional unhealthy cravings."}

I had the Wendy's Pickle Sandwich, Chicago Cheesesteak, and Animal Fries

The Wendy's Pickle is a mock Buffalo chicken chicken sandwich on a Ciabatta roll, and it's actually pretty decent. You can tell it's not real chicken, but the flavor it has is good on its own. The reason it's called the Wendy's "Pickle" is because it's loaded with pickles...I'm a huge pickle fan, so I was happily content.

My daughter had the Chicago Cheesteak and I found myself wishing I ordered it, because it was pretty tasty. It consists of mock steak filled with onions and peppers, the only thing it was missing is mushrooms...that would have sealed the deal, but it was good nonetheless.

My granddaugther had the Animal fries, which is a vegan version of the In & Out classic, it had vegan cheese, onions and Thousand Island sauce, and it was addicting.

I washed the meal down with a classic Margarita which was above average, the restaurant was a mix of hipster and grunge, and the staff was attentive - I'll be back!"}

I'm an occasional meat eater and not ashamed about admitting it. But going to this place makes every carnivorous instinct in my body shrivel with shame. If more places like this exist, there would be no more meat-eaters in the world. I know it.

Seriously, every dish I've had here beats its non-vegetarian counterpart by several strides. The fake chicken tastes better than real chicken, especially when it's seasoned so well here. 

Everything from the eggless spring rolls to the "fake" meat bowls and flatbread pizzas is wonderful. Top any dish with endless toppings for just $1 and finish your meal with a tsoynami dessert.

I only wish there's a place that is equally delicious in San Francisco. There probably is, but I just can't seem to find it...

Another one of my favorites in their cole slaw with tahini.  It has good flavor and a slightly crunchy texture.  It is very fresh.

Aside from the good food, the service staff is wonderful.  They are welcoming and helpful.  Most refreshingly, they are totally unpretentious.

Food came out quickly even with special requests.  We ordered wings, fries and 2 sandwiches.  According to my non vegetarian partner they were right on the money.  
Alley loved no one was snacking on her animal friends and everyone there was super friendly.  She especially loved that vegan water straight from the cup.  Alley just couldn't get enough cup...her nose was already inside.  I think there is something special about the vegan plastic cup because she refused to use her bowl even when the water was poured from the cup.  
Stop by Green for their excellent vegan items and their pupnip ingrained plastic cup.  We will be back."}

I will not speak in length of the old décor as it has no more relevance to the epitome of swank that is the new look at Green. I won't talk about the recycled material art that lined the South wall that included lightly painted utensil drawer organizers and VW hubcaps. I also won't talk about the slightly preachy overly optimistic quote that wrapped the wall through the corner near the restrooms written in a fun script only an undergrad girl studying design theory and armed with a paint brush could achieve. I also won't mention the antique Piano up against the dividing wall that in spirit only begged one thing of whoever laid eyes on it, it's modest demand was to be played in a manner worthy of the Saloons that once occupied the desert space where Green now lies, yet the only text on the instrument was a small sign written with a marker saying " Please Do Not Play Piano". I also won't talk about the loooooong table going from front door to register that on busy nights you'd get stuck sitting at with two of your friends only to have your back brushed against by numerous vegetarian butts that graze only on accident and rarely warrant an apology but still. . . no buns on the back please.  
I will however mention their new patio that has arrived just in time for the cold season when dining on said patio will surely manifest in me a tension worthy of Hitchcock's direction between enjoying sweater weather with solely my hot entrée or hitting the tipping point of finger numbing cold with my seemingly mandatory post-dinner Tsoynami. The caged in effect achieved by the patio might be resonant to that of a human cage, which to give credit to the designer might be the intent. The subtext of the patio may read something to the effect of Peter Signer's breakthrough work, Animal Liberation, eliciting the contradictory feeling of being outside and feeling claustrophobic and caged in thus allowing the patron to empathize with the plight of factory farmed animals and subsequently prompting the euphoric smugness that comes from the knowledge that no animals were harmed or exploited in making that mock steak po'boy (except maybe the dudes in the kitchen scraping by for minimum wage*). The vintage car doors are still in effect over freshly vinyled booths that safely seat four, but typically six, partially due to their limited seating and mostly due to the nearly miniature size of the average patron who tend to be slight, frail and eager to show they don't mind a little contact. 
The alternative girl vibe that exudes from the front of the house staff meshes well with the obvious southwestern conventionality of the kitchen staff. A "powerclash" in true form. If you disregard their post-Juno fashion choices you see some of the nicest, under-tipped, funny people in the local service industry. Calling in an order is as easy as vegan pie and pretty swift too. I've frequented this location for 5 years and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The Secret BBQ "Chicken" sandwich is at the top of the charts but if not that then the Argentine Po'boy is a fine choice as well. Hands down one of my favorite places in the Valley.

Here's a Tip: don't be a dummy, add Chai to your Tsoynami.

*I have no idea how the kitchen staff is compensated."}

I used to do work on those Tsoynamis! I am not vegan, but I have an egg allergy, which makes eating dessert hard sometimes :'(

Green holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I ever ate dinner at in Arizona. When I moved to Arizona my mom (who also has an egg allergy) came out to look at apartments with me. We were staying around the corner at the Holiday Inn in Old Town, where they recommended we eat at Green for vegan food. We then returned every day for either lunch or dinner for the remainder of our trip. Once I arrived in Arizona I used to get Green at least once a week, generally as take out. Everything is delicious, not really super healthy for the most part but I can deal with that when I am eating vegan food sometimes! I also don't think that is the goal here, I believe Green is taking a vegan twist on comfort foods and they do it well. I used to get a Coffee Tsoynami and the Calexico Burger--so good, but you'll need a siesta afterwards.

I personally prefer when not a lot of meat substitutes are used in vegan food, which is the only reason why I am giving Green 4 instead of 5 stars. Most dishes use a meat substitute like seitan or tofu, though I'm sure you can avoid this by ordering something else with beans for example. I feel sad I never went to Nami in my time out in Phoenix and when I visit next I will need to try their food out too in addition to returning to Green!"}

If they opened a CenPho location I would be in heaven. However, it is always well worth the drive. So where do I start? I normally stick to one or two things on the menu at most restaurants, but this place has so many good ones I bounce around. First, salads - I'm currently obsessed with the Spicy Peanut "chicken" salad, but also love the Green salad..simple light and tasty.  Sandwiches - Spicy Po Boy....love it.  Bowls - Kung Pao is my favorite. I also like the spicy peanut bowl.  They are actually both very similar though so either is great. Pizza - the Western..delish! And probably the best part of Green....the Soynami. I've had several and all are amazing and better than any other soft serve option I was throwing down my gullet before I began Vegan. Sometimes they even have a wedding cake soynami.  If you ever see this on the menu get it! Oh and how could I forget the apps....hummus and "wings" are my favorite. This place is very reasonably priced too.  We can get an app, two meals, and a soynami for about $25 bucks.

The staff is always super nice and friendly. Service is always fast too. The atmosphere is pretty funky and cool although you might not see this from the outside. Just go inside - you'll be fine.

We've also been there for 4th of July and Thanksgiving and both were awesome. Everyone thinks vegans eat badly at Thanksgiving with no dead bird and all, but I couldn't imagine anyone not loving Green's Thanksgiving meals. 

Go there and enjoy!"}

Now about the food. I ordered the Big WAC, which was surprisingly delicious, although a bit greasy (kept dripping in the basket). The thyme fries were good. My husband had the BBQ burger, which he said tasted like cardboard with a layer of sauce which made it...in his words "edible". He made a good point that without the "special sauce" mine probably would've tasted pretty bland too. My little one had the kids "burger" and fries. He didn't realize it wasn't real meat, so that was good :) My other one wasn't as adventurous and just wanted a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. I happened to notice on the receipt they upcharged us 50 cents to add cucumber (really, $6.50 for lettuce, cucumber and dressing?). Anyways. Kids wanted a chocolate chip cookie for $2 each, which they both said tasted good but a bit dry. I ordered the Banana Cream pie Tsoynami, which I highly recommend. It was huge so you may want to share it. I may have to stop back for another if I'm in the area sometime, but I highly doubt we're going back for the food anytime soon."}

My friend ordered the sweet & sour tofu and said it was OK. Since we were hitting a bunch of restaurants this night, I didn't have a main course, but I DID get the "tsoynami". 

Speaking to the tsoynamis, they are delicious. Soy based ice-cream blizzard treats. I didn't realize how much I had missed milkshakes since going pescatarian, and this tasted like it came from Dairy Queen (I got the cookies-n-cream tsoynami). All the yummy goodness of a blizzard w/o any of the stomach aches, health issues, or moral issues (or whatever reason you've given up dairy). 

The rest of the menu looks innovative and tasty and I wish we had more time in Scottsdale to try more items. 

If you were to compare this to a non-vegan place, I don't know if it would rank as high. But, for what it is, this place seems to have found a niche and is doing it well.

**things to note** This place is almost impossible to find. It is tucked away in a corner in a non-descript strip-mall (by a car dealership if I remember correctly). If I didn't have GPS, I would have given up on trying to find it. Also, the employees are all kinda dirty looking - expect hippy-types with dreadlocks and piercings and stretched earlobes. While I respect everyone's personal choices, I also appreciate hygiene in the people who are preparing my food... just sayin'...."}

Problems are in the service, since the start of summer 2011 it has gone way downhill. Today I waited for 35 min for my food, had other people who ordered after me served, then when they finally noticed me, they came over and told me to come up and ask if my food is taking too long. Isn't that their job to serve in a timely manner? Since when do I pay $10 for $4 worth of food to not get served?

On top of it, they screwed up my order, I had to go back in and get it fixed (more waiting time). Being late, being stupid, and being wrong? Three strikes in one visit - this place is done.

BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.

my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos. 

their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.

1. You are 100% vegan. I have a plethora of choices to eat from and not have to worry about what its made with and if its vegan or not. 

2. Tsoynamis. Nuf' said.

3. Vegan crab puffs!!!

4. You have specials that change all of the time! I just wish you would make about 90% of these specials permanent menu items! I love some of them so much it depresses me when they run out or are no longer available. Example, the Chicken Schwarma wrap. I would KILL for that to be on the menu. It is my favorite thing ever. 

5. Most of your staff are some of the coolest people ever, and always remember us. Its nice when staff remember you (and your favorite specials). It also helps that my husband and I have been here at least 50 times in the last year. 

6. You don't just make me choose from a few measly salads. You have sandwiches, pizza, pasta, bowls, appetizers. The BBQ chicken and the Mexicali burgers are the greatest things ever. 

7. You are relatively close to my house, and I don't have to trek 30 miles to get there. So if at 8pm I decide I want you, I can get to you and not have to worry about making it before you close. 

8. You have an in store market where if I feel the need to pick up a box of vegan mac and cheese, I can. 

There are tons of reasons to eat here, whether you are vegan or not. You have to try this place. It is amazing and no matter what you get off the menu, you will not be disappointed."}

The sandwich was smothered in sauce, and was overwhelming my mouth with flavor to the point where I had to wipe off excess sauce. The patty was limp and tiny and although it was vegan, it could never compare to a real chicken patty. Overall, I was completely dissatisfied with my overly priced sandwich. The only good thing about this place was quick service and clean bathrooms."}

As a meat-eater with a soy allergy, there are many reasons not to eat here, but I gave all of that up to enjoy as many entrees as possible. 

Where do I begin...we tried the buffalo wings which had the right taste and texture as meat ones, and the ranch dressing was perfect, the CRAB PUFFS which were mind-blowing, the bbq sandwich, the curry pasta, the argentine sandwich (delicious bread and chimichurri sauce), the fish tacos (which were good but not nearly as amazing as the other entrees), and the kung pao chicken. And oh yes, two cupcakes and the betterfinger soy ice cream. 

I am so depressed there isn't one in Austin, but I would say Green is reason enough to go back to AZ."}

Living in the city of healthy, organic, locally grown, vegan, gluten free, gmo free, certified rabbit food (aka San Francisco)... I've been to a few of these types of restaurants.  This place has all the healthy entrees one could want without the "flair" of a pretentious hipster taking your order.  Best of all everything on the menu looks good.  They simply make things that people like without trying to "reinvent the wheel" with some sort crazy food combination/fusion.  I always enjoy eating at a place without having to read some detailed instructions from the chef on how the proper way of eating it should be for the best flavor. (Yes, it's happened)

Since I'm not entirely used to Arizona's 6 degrees hotter than hell heat I have gotten the tsoynamis and their peanut butter and chocolate crack bar.  It's the perfect fix for that sweet tooth craving that I get from time to time, or in this case three or four times this week.  I'm coming back tomorrow for lunch with my beautiful wife and I'm going for the buffalo "wings" because they've been calling me day and night.  This place is worth the 673 mile drive and the only bad thing I can say about it is that once I leave this weekend I'm going to crave this place.  Green, you've been good to me this week, you damn well better be here when I come back and don't change a thing!"}

I got the Coconut Curry Tofu Bowl for two days in a row and found the other "GREEN" in Scottsdale.  Their food is perfectly flavored and I love the hippie atmosphere.

Everything I've ordered has been tasty.  The mock chicken is pretty convincing. You can't beat the taste or price. Finally vegan doesn't feel like a deprivation.

Walk in usually there's a small line, grab a menu near the only register and choose your items. Don't be like Susan who waits last minute to look at the menu at the register holding up the line. You order and they bring the food to your table.

My top 3 favorite dishes: Thai Peanut Mock chicken bowl, BBQ Mock Chicken sandwich, and Jerk Tofu Salad. Jerk Tofu is tangy and over a bed of greens is like flakes of heaven.

If you need a little more bites: Thyme fries, just skinny fries with thyme. Buffalo "Wings" are delicious, they're just like the real thing, but a little chewier. If you like curry, the samosas are superb. I could eat 3 orders of them throughout a binge marathon on Netflix.

If you still have some room in your tummy, you MUST get a Tsoynami! They have seasonal flavors and their standard ones. I usually try the seasonals, but PBnJ is also my jam *pun intended.

Since high doses of wheat are more a problem for me, I gave it a shot. Truth be told, it was the authentic flavor of a "Big *ac" from the other guys, but the texture was a bit off and the GF bun was SUPER HEAVY on my tummy :/ I ended up eating the second half of the burger with no bun. It came with fries (or I got it with fries, can't remember the menu layout) and they were scrumptious! The staff was super friendly and accommodating as I asked my customary handful of questions!

Practically the only Vegan place around town, unless you count those Ethiopian places.  But i like green for the effort, tastes, and ambiance.  The variety is pretty good ranging from salads, pizzas, burgers, "po-boys" and noodles.  This time i had the Mexicali burger and my lady friend had the spicy peanut sause noodles (with is pretty much like a Thai noodle bowl, with mock-chicken).  The burger was sup-par.  the patty was more of a ground meat texture than a patty so it broke apart easily.  The flavor wasnt really there and it took ketchup and siracha sauce to bring it up.  The fries however very very good.  Thin cut, light and crispy.  Definitely a highlight of that meal.  as for the Thai noodles, it was pretty good too. The mock chicken was very good. not too dry and had a good texture to it...dare i say almost like chicken.  My only complaint is the price.  You really dont get for what you pay for.  the portions  are a lil small and the tofu/mock meat are far and few in between.  but still relatively inexpensive to eat, all entrees are about $10.  but we could get a lil more fries, or noodles or vegies for that much.

another complaint was didnt save enough room for the tsoynami ice creams they looked absolutely delish.  next time... next time

Pros
-only vegan in town
-flavorful with a good selection of dishes
-cute decor


Cons:
-meals a lil small for $10, but not that bad."}

The special I had the following items: Serano Chicken Po-boy - Chicken (their chicken - which you would think you are eating the real thing but BETTER), grilled pineapple, red onion, lettuce, cashews (I think, there was a few crunchy nuts in there) in a lavosh wrap w/serrano, agave and honey sauce with their fries.

The atmosphere is fun and edgy, the employees are cool, friendly and helpful and the food is REALLY good!

I had the Singapore Orange Bowl with House Tofu. I chose brown rice over noodles although I'm not crazy about either. The proportion or vegetables and tofu to rice was very high. A nice surprise! The rice was on the bottom of the bowl kind of like a small garnish, not a boat load of rice to make up for lack of veggies.  

I had a Creamsicle Flavor Soynami which was awesome! 

This is my new favorite place! I want to try more things on the menu sometime very soon.

The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is the restroom was kind of dim and base. I couldn't figure out how to work the faucet but otherwise, I had a stellar experience there and would highly recommend it."}

I can still remember my first encounter - the buffalo wings and dipping sauce. I thought I heard someone mention that it was vegan. No, there's no way a chicken wing could be vegan. But then I heard it again- everything is vegan. You might say that I loaded up on those little buffalo wings, but who could blame me! There's a reason they've won awards... they're amazing! Next, I tried the mock chicken skewers that were smothered in green's original espresso barbecue sauce. I have to say that Green has really nailed the mock meat. The texture, flavor and taste are so authentic that sometimes I find myself second guessing the mock in the meat.

It's no surprise that off of their regular menu, my favorites are the buffalo chicken sandwich and the barbecue chicken sandwich. I also order a plate of the buffalo wings as an appetizer every time I stop in. Their pasta bowls are also really good, and their mock meatballs are pretty delicious. My only less than stellar experience at Green was when I ordered the Mexi-Cali burger. I'm not sure what the patty was made of, but it was red, and I wasn't really into the flavor. But the thyme shoe string fries rescued the meal and my tummy.

The lemon-aide and lime-aide are also delicious, and I would recommend giving them a shot if you're generally a cola-junkie.

One last tip would be to get there early on Saturday nights as they get pretty busy and you might be hard pressed to find an open table."}

It is a little pricey sometimes, but you are paying for specialty foods.  Their vegan/veggie market in the store is convenient if you want to try something out, but it's really marked up in comparison to buying almost any of these things from the internet (not even in bulk)."}

On my most recent visit, my friend and I both ordered Drunken Mushroom bowls with chicken.  My daughter ordered something off their new kids' menu.  When our bowls arrived, neither one of them had any mushrooms!  What the...?!  Also, my daughter's food came way after ours arrived.    

When a manager came out because our bowls were made incorrectly, he did not apologize.  He just said he didn't know how it happened and he'd make sure they were made right.  We waited an awfully long time for the mushrooms to be added to the bowls.  And, while I did not expect anything as a comp for our inconvenience, we did not get anything comped.

We also asked if they had any bowls that were not made with sugar in the sauce due to my friend being a diabetic.  They told us they had NO sauces or marinades that did not contain sugar.  Wow.  I knew Green was like fast food for Vegans, but there should be SOMETHING without added sugar.  Perhaps a simple soy and garlic marinade?  Since they had to remake our bowls anyway, my friend just got vegetables without any sauce added.  

While I still do love the Green New American Vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix, this location just does not have the customer service or the attention to detail that the other location has.  

Sadly, I don't make it to this part of town enough to warrant a return visit after this last visit."}

Well, no more shots for Green are in our future...

We ordered at the desk and our food came out within 15 minutes. No big deal there. My friend ordered the artichoke dip that was served with chips and hummus that was served  with deep fried pita chips, and I ordered the Kung Pao "Chicken". 

If you didn't tell me there was artichokes in the dip, I would have never known. It was more of an enchilada sauce/bean dip weird mess. Not horrible on the pallet, but def not what we expected was ordered. The Hummus was spicy and came with a pickle (??) on the side. Pita crisps were way too deep fried for their own good. Needless to say... we did not ask for a to-go box. 

The Kung Pao chicken wasn't bad per-say, but my "Chicken" was very stringy and foamy to the texture. Yes, I said I wasn't a veggie head, but I have had Morning Star "chicken" before and it's 10 times better than what  came in my bowl.

I get veggie heads love this spot because they don't have to narrow down the menu to 2 items, but me thinks not."}

No macro platters here, though if they did have one, i bet it'd be covered in some mouth-watering sauce.  This vegan restaurant is for people who like animal products as much it is for people who don't.  Almost everything on the menu comes with at least an option of mock meat of one kind or another.  And mock meat is tasty, though probably not necessarily healthy.  The original "g" spicy po-boy reminded me almost exactly of Switch's Buffalo Bleu Chicken sandwich (my favorite).  It was hardly noticeable that Green's version had no bleu cheese, mock chicken patties and veganaise.  The texas "moo-shroom" po-boy was excellent as well with a sweet BBQ sauce and heaps of mushrooms, red peppers and onions.  I do not like the tahini coleslaw - too much peanut sauce.  We were so impressed with our lunch that we ordered a couple of cookies for dessert and that was when we remembered the reason we could never be entirely vegan....no butter in the cookies!  At least they use real chocolate instead of carob.

The spice level of the sauce was perfect it had a really nice kick to it, but not  the point of watering eyes. My one complaint was the gluten free bread. The texture and density of it was not good.  It was really dry and it soaked up too much of the sauces on my sandwich. 

Not going to lie though,  I was still hungry after I finished eating. Mind you i just finished playing a sand volleyball tournament. So next I ordered the green hummus the chicken wings and the BFF which is a fried "chicken" sandwich to try and take home leftovers. The hummus was great, as well as the corn tortilla chips it was served with, nice and crunchy. The hummus said it was made with roasted poblano peppers which I didn't notice but it was very tasty. I didn't like the quality of the "chicken" wings as much as the chicken in the chicken sandwich. It may have been the same but just sliced differently. And as for the BFF fried chicken sandwich it was outstanding. non-vegans might have thought this was real Fried Chicken. I also asked for a side of their Expreso barbecue sauce which turned out to have great tang and flavor. I can't wait to go back and try more menu items."}

The ingenuity of offering comfort vegan food is matched by its excellent and delicious execution of the concept.

The bistro features a varied menu, bolstered by specials that change daily. Green also features a handful of prepackaged vegan specialty foods, including gelatin-free marshmallows.

From first bite of the drunken mushroom chicken Green won me over. I do love mushrooms but the mock chicken totally fooled my carnivore mind. I love the flavors in the dish and how it was made together. Since my first time last Thursday 3/28 I have been in love with this place. I've had their samosas which are good, the Singapore Tofu noodle, yum yum! the vegan chili fries, outstanding (although next time I'm getting the chili on the side to avoid sogginess)! yes, thyme fries are my new loves. lol. the buffalo spicy "wings" are on point. BuT the one thing that makes Green extra awesome are their... Tsoynamis!!! These vegan treats, wait are they vegan? hmm still are worth my cheat days!! YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYY! The PB&J is so freaking good, love the peanut butter especially, the butterfinger is just addicting and the banana cream pie is my new crush!

I have always wanted to try Green, but had never really had an excuse to go. 

So Friday night the hubs and I make the trek across town. We arrived about 630 and it was JAM PACKED. Not a seat to be had. At Green you stand in line and place your order at the register and pay for it then. You find a seat and a waiter will come out and yell your name and then deliver your food. 

We placed our order and took a table outside as that was all there was. Kinda sucked, but oh well. It did start to rain, but there was a little over hang keeping us dry.

We ordered starters. Crab Puffs and Spicy Buffalo "wings" Both were pretty good. The crab puffs were spot on, you really couldn't tell a difference between them and the real thing. The "wings" were good as well, but for sure a big difference between the real thing and the mock. But still tasty. 

The hubs ordered the Original "g" Spicy Po-Boy, a Spicy buffalo mock chicken sammie and I got the Mum's Meatball Po-Boy. Both were really very good. The Thyme fries are really crisp and tasty, but like other reviews, you cant really taste the thyme, not sure whats up with that. 

After we were done, we decided to get a couple Tsoynamis to go. I am a ice cream FREAK, so that WAS going to be my biggest challenge getting through the 1 month Vegan diet...but not anymore. OMG...The tsoynami's are AMAZING!!! I had the Deez Hazelnuts, freaken fantastic! The hubs got the Betterfinger (Greens version of a butterfinger) SO GOOD!!!! 

We will be going back to green even after I am done with my 1 month stint as a vegan."}

This is good wholesome food, not overcooked/over-sauced restaurant food.  I got the madras curry bowl with extra roasted vegetables which was packed with broccoli especially.  This is a rare occasion that I feel almost better eating out as I would if cooking at home.  Good amount of sauce to flavor the dish but not overdo it.  Also, I've missed ice cream since becoming sensitive to dairy and a small sample of the soy swirl ice cream really hit the spot."}

Since then I have been handed a plethora of new information about their menu that might make it more appealing for almost anyone.

One of my previous complaints was that besides some of their sandwiches and their salads, their food was particularly oily, or greasy, etc. I thought, this place is too good not to have some sort of alternative to this situation and guess what? There is a solution. I admit, I prematurely judged the cuisine before asking enough questions. Turns out, almost everything on the menu, especially the entrees are customizable to the point that you can almost make anything on the menu fit your preference and the staff is more than accommodating and gracious about it. 

I have since had a lot of items on the menu and been able to get many items to fit my dietary preferences: sandwiches (the Wendy's Pickle is a great customizable one), almost all the bowls I have tried with less oil, steamed veggies, or light sauce, etc. The salads I have swapped out the meats for different kinds of tofu or light sauce, etc. Almost every time, my food has been delicious and if it wasn't, it was usually because my choice of customization was poor. 

Not to mention, like I said in the last review, this location has great service, as do all the locations and it is clean too. 

Whether a ravenous carnivore, local vegetarian vegan, out-of-towner, or whatever, I can pretty much attest to the fact that you'll more than likely find one, probably, two items on the menu to satisfy an appetite."}

Also tried their rosemary fries and it was quite a large basket of skinny fries. Really good.

I really love sandwiches but I recently got the Ranchero salad  which was also good and much more filling than I expected. I cannot stop going back there and every time it's a struggle to pick just one thing to try! It's basically a vegan paradise and if you don't eat meat you need to check it out! 

I originally went to the location in downtown phoenix before moving to Tempe and they are similar and the food is exactly the same. The Downtown location has a much different more artsy vibe and feels a little smaller. I do not love the Tempe locations outdoor seating because it's just a patio with a view of a parking lot and street."}

I started with a yummy salad- greens with balsamic, dried figs, pecans & strawberry.  the "small" salad was a very good size. then had the apricot miso rice bowl with tons of veggie mock chicken.  incredible sauce, I would have licked the bowl, had the restaraunt not been full.  

speaking of full, even though I WAS full at that point, I could not pass up the Soy-namis.  had a Ginger Snap & damn if I did not eat all 16 glorious ounces of it...

my belly is distended. it was worth it.

The food is all vegan/vegetarian and it's awesome.  They have quite a few choices on the menu, much of which is made with mock chicken or beef. You can also get crispy tofu or fresh tofu in most anything too.

You order at the counter, and the staff is super friendly. We got the samosas for an appetizer.  They were pretty tasty, although a little mushy inside.  The sauce they came with was delish. 

Although there are tasty looking bowls and pasta on the menu, I got the Original "g" po' boy and my boyfriend got the Mum's meatball po'boy.  Mine was sooo good and really spicy.  The sauce on the mock chicken was awesome and the thyme fries are delicious.  My boyfriend loved his too, and the few bites I had of his sandwich were definitely enjoyable. He got the curry pasta salad with his and really liked it. 

We decided to try out a Soynami too- which is soy ice cream mixed with organic ingredients.  We chose the Newman's chocolate cookies with chocolate sauce.  Really good. 

The food was great, and the best part is that it's super cheap.  Our sandwiches were only $6.50.  That's crazy! Our app was $3.50- even crazier!

I talked with one of the employees and he told me that they have plans to get a liquor license and once that happens, they will become a full service restaurant. 

The decor of the place is pretty cool too.  They have artwork lining the walls, including one titled "Penis bites man."  Hmm.

I really liked their lighting- it gave the place an intimate feel. 

I will definitely be back and I recommend it to anyone and everyone- not just vegetarians."}

Granted I am from Richmond, Va where lots of restaurants do vegan/vegetarian, and they do it really, really well. 

This place is quasi-vegetarian foods. It's just mock meats...where are the black bean burgers, the lentil burgers, the wholesome vegetables?!?! Wah. I was really disappointed. This is definitely a place to ease people into vegetarianism. 

I got the blackened jerk chicken pita (it wasn't spicy....?) and my boyfriend got the chicken parm (obviously not real chicken on either). Both were valiant attempts. They still failed. The fries were good, though. 

I would give it only 1 star, but we did go at 8:15 pm and they close at 9. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt....

The service was also really bad. Lady didn't look at us while we ordered (her eyes were wandering around), the bathrooms are outside with no signage, and I guess you are supposed to assume you order at the counter? 

I am not trying to make this overly-critical, but this place could do A LOT better in many ways. I probably won't go back unfortunately; too bad, I was looking forward to this!"}

This is not a healthy veggie place... they have asian dishes, but most of their dishes are "comfort food" .. they have vegan pizzas, bbq chicken sandwiches, meatball sandwiches, fries, buffalo wings... all the type of stuff most vegetarians/vegas CRAVE.

They lean more towards the "comfort food" than healthful choices, but even vegans need their comfort food sometimes.

Green  also gives you a selection of side items including fries, tahini coleslaw(a favorite) pasta, etc and many come with the main item as a meal. They also include appetizers including artichoke gratine which was a yummy dip with chips, vegan chilli fries, crab puffs(another favorite!) and "boneless wings" with their homemade vegan ranch dressing. The only unfortunate thing is that both times I've had their wings they have been way too salty. So it kind of ruins it.

My fav things to get there, and if you're going there for the first time you must try their sandwiches! I am a huge fan of their secret bbq chickn sandwich. Messy but it is so satisfying and almost creepy on how well it imitates a real chicken sandwich but it's guiltfree and deliciously crafted! This sandwich will not let you down! My boyfriend also got me into the argetine which has a steaky taste mock meat in  a sub-type sandwich that will sure to make your mouth water. I have had one of their noodle bowls with mock beef and sweet and sour flavor but it was not as filling as their sandwiches. Maybe because I didn't think there was enough noodles but they're pretty good! 

Now the place itself is pretty hipster. Artsy feel and vibe and many times there will be artwork for sale or art contests going on. It's definately a cool environment they have a couple couches and its a great place to dine in and bring your friends. It's not really a waiter/waitress type thing. You grab a menu in line order what you want at the counter and pay and then they bring it out to you when it's ready. Most the time it's ready rather quickly and you don't have to worry about flagging down a waitress/waiter if you need anything.

Green also hosted I think it was the 3rd annual thankliving last year that I went to for the first time that had a delicious vegan thanksgiving plate that included everything you could imagine for thanksgiving veganized! Delicious! Definitely an event you don't want to miss!

All and all I love this place. Veg comfort food at it's best!! And it's not just for Vegans I swear even if you're not a herbivore you will love green!"}

Green doesn't quite meet (meat?) this standard: though they make some of the best meatless meat dishes in town, I still catch myself thinking, "This would be even better if it was made of beef and bacon." Their imitation beef and chicken are impressively like the real things, but that's the fundamental problem (in my humble opinion) with this style of vegetarian cuisine: no matter how good you make it, "like the real thing" is never gonna beat the real thing. Their veggie burgers are tasty, but burgers are tastier. Soynamis are pretty good, but milkshakes will always be better. I know that New American is their thing, but I think Green would be even better if they took a little more inspiration from traditions like Indian and Middle Eastern, which have done spectacular things without meat for thousands of years.

None of this, of course, means I won't continue to eat here pretty frequently. I love their egglessrolls, poboys (both Original and Argentine... especially the Argentine with extra chimichurri sauce). Their thyme fries are pretty good, but I don't really taste the thyme. I've gotten a couple bowls, which have been good but a little sparse on the mock meat. A cheap and delicious option is to get a side of lo mein with some mock beef."}

Let me Bo Bites as I dine
I got a little vegetarian inside
And you know that my fans 
Has got to deal with it 
I don't care how I sing
I'm not about to stop for anyway
Cause it's all about the food in me
Mm-hmm 

I want some Green in the morning
Some Green in the evening just for me
I need a Soynami
That can satisfy me just for me 
If you got that kind of taste
Cause I'm into that kind of eats
I got a veggie craving, everybody eat
Cause we don't give a damn about a thing


Green has been a vegetarian staple restaurant ever since I've moved to Phoenix!

Every time I come back there's something new and something old.  Improvements and renovations are always made in this quaint little corner restaurant.  I don't feel like I'm a hippie when I come here since there seems to be all walks of life young and old that come here.  

Today I started with a craft beer and the Big Wac Burger.  I actually order the little Wac with fries since the Big Wac seemed like a little too big for my appetite.  Overall, it was a knock-off version of the Big Mac, but with no processed meat.  I thought it was pretty interesting, but in the end nothing too original.  My buddy ordered their spicy buffalo wings made with soy chicken -- this was probably my favorite bite of the night; spicy indeed and a hint of crunch.  I think if they didn't douse it was the sauce it would have made a perfect combination, but still good overall.  I also ordered the Soynami for dessert; a valley favorite and must eat especially during the summer time.  It's pretty much soft serve ice cream in a pint with toppings of your choice of candies or baked goods.  

In the end, Green is definitely a local hot spot for vegetarians, but also foodies whom want to venture out and try something new.  With the popularity of Non-GMO and Vegan movement coming strong; I can see Green staying for generations ahead! - Enjoy!"}

I also drank the Sweet Lime, which was very refreshing, especially in 106 degree heat. Everyone we were with enjoyed their food, except my boyfriend, who wasn't too into their version of fake mozzarella cheese...was kind of rubbery, but um, what do you expect?

Luckily I am almost done with every aspect of the God Forsaken Phoenix area (finally back to So Cal in 2018) but decided to give Green another shot for a quick lunch.

Being a workday I did not have 2 hours for lunch and thought I would be pretty safe ordering a damn burger and chili.... 

Wrong!!! It took 45 minutes to get my order due to the supposed reason that more Chili was being made. Well when I finally got my order the Chili was cold and the burger was so so.

In addition ( and this is where the arrogance comes in) the kid who brought my order forgot to bring a spoon for the Chili and when I went up to ask for one a pimply faced girl who was working the register gave me attitude.

Keep your attitude to your self and Greens staff should visit vegan restaurants in LA or the Bay Area to see how it's done.

On a side note last time I ordered at the Green midtown location it took an inordinate amount of time to get my order there as well..I should have remembered that before going in today"}

I've had almost everything at this place. It's pretty good. Bruh, let me tell you about the "icecream" this shit is fucking fabulous. So, I'm assuming this slice of heaven is aome sort of soymilk frozen yumminess. Not too sure and I don't really care. If it was frozen gasoline I'd eat that. Fuck yeah. Anyway, my favorite right; is called a fucking Fluffernutter. Keep your jiz jokes to youtube kiddos. This is delish. They take that weird soyicenotcream deal, mix that shit with some ricemellow. Which is fucking glorious. You with me still? So ricemellow... Then peanut butter. I love peanut butter. Also, youtube commenters go back to your shadows. Then you add some bananas. Bruh. Bananas, ricemellow and peanut butter. This shit tastes like moonpies. Not sure if y'all remember them, but dude. Amazing. I personally like to order twice that ricefluff shiznat and then add in some chocolate saaauce. Orgy in yourmotherfuckingmouth.

First, let me tell you I'm not a vegetarian. I like bacon way too much and I have a hard time even liking vegetables. I went today for a going away lunch with a co-worker and so surprised at just how good Green was!  I admit, I was totally trash talking the mock-chicken before I had it. It just sounded weird. Pssshaw...."mock" chicken. 

I'm just super excited about the fact that most of the bowls are gluten free except the Thai peanut. I got the coconut curry "chicken" and boy, was it tasty! They make it with tamari sauce instead of soy sauce, hence the gluten free-ness of the dish.

If I wasn't so full from the artichoke dip I would have devoured a soynami (vegan blizzard). They don't have any gluten ingredients in them either, except for whatever toppings you might toss in. It's pretty rare that I can go to a restaurant and eat 80% of the menu. What a treat!"}

Putting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The "mock" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.  

They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.  

I would actually come back here, even if other options were present.  That's saying a lot.

But I have one bone to pick with the menu (is that a bad phrase to use for a vegetarian restaurant?): it needs more selections that truly celebrate the vegetable. Almost everything available is mock beef, fake chicken and faux pork. That's fine, I guess, especially for recent vegetarian meat-eaters who are missing some of the old textures and flavors. But for long-time veggies - and even for carnivores like me looking for variety - the menu could stand to have a few more dishes celebrating beans and mushrooms and soy and all the other incredible flora that are just fine being themselves and not pretending to be flesh.

It's better that way - and, let's face it, that veggie burger is never going to taste as good as the real burger if that's what you are really after."}

However, everything else just made me want to go get chipotle.  This place just is not for me.  

This place is good for vegans and non vegans that want to try it and decide for themselves, but mostly just vegans. 

I will give it 3 stars for me and 4 for the vegans, according to a lot of the veggie mites its one of the best places to go.

Recommendation: Vegans and people who like soy ice cream, but nothing to go out of your way to get."}

The food at Haji-Baba is still my standard by which I compare other Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food.

Haji is consistently good, filling and flavorful - albeit healthy even.  A true landmark in the valley that must be visited, at least once, by everyone, anyone who desires a taste of the Mediterranean, or is feeling adventurous, without leaving the East Valley.

Although lacking a bit of ambiance, eat here and it may just inspire you to make your own hummus, tabouli or falafel.  This is why Haji-Baba is a one stop affair: after your meal, pop over to the grocery side and grab the needed items (some found nowhere else) to whip up your own creation.  

Don't feel like making the food yourself?  Call them, even with short notice, and you can please a hungry crowd and wow them with tasty morsels of delicious homemade food.  Or just get take-out and call it good!

It is worth the drive or a visit.  Light rail stops right out front, bike parking is nearby. Uber your way here and you will be glad you did!

I went for a late lunch, and had no problem being seated. Service was good, and the atmosphere was friendly. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with hummus, tabouli and garlic sauce. 

The food portions were huge. The hummus was good, but a bit too salty. The chicken shawarma was nicely seasoned in general, but was all dark meat, which I don't care for. Also, the garlic sauce was more like garlic mayonnaise, which I also dislike. I came prepared for the more traditional blend of garlic, lemon juice and olive oil which is generally served at my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis.

All in all, I was let down by my meal. I will however be returning to the market again soon."}

Yes come here really hungry because the portions are huge! 

There is a small market that is attached to the small dining area. It's not too pretty but don't let that stop you from trying out their food! 

We stopped by for dinner and it was starting to get busy when we arrived. There aren't too many tables but they were definitely doing their best to clean them as soon as people were done. 

We were helped right away and menus were given to us. They have sandwiches and a ton of entrees to pick from. We decided to order one shish kabob, one gyro plate, and a chicken schwarma plate. 

My chicken schwarma was delicious! It came with a ton of chicken, hummus, delicious basmati rice, and a piece of pita. My husband had the shish kabob plate and the also came with rice, grilled vegetables, and a side salad. He also had a small guava drink for $3.50 (no refill) but it was well worth it.

Each plate was priced about $10 each. We spent about $45 and were there about an hour. Portions are really big and so we still had food leftover. 

I would definitely be back to try the chicken schwarma in the sandwich style."}

Having grown up on Middle Eastern food any opportunity I get to take down an authentic Gyro I won't pass up. So my buddy Dan and I go to one of his old local favorites Haji-Baba. 

I order the Gyro and fries and was blown away. The price was cheap; the meat was well seasoned and thinly sliced. I hate it when they slice it too thick.

All in all I had a great time the only reason why it didn't get five stars is it took a while because it was slammed during lunch. But if you work anywhere near ASU in Tempe and are craving a good Gyro don't think twice...Haji Baba."}

Food-wise, I tried the Gyro sandwich and the veggie combination plate. The Gyro meat was on par with other places, but probably not the best I've had. To be honest, most Gyro meat is pretty much the same (and all pretty good). It's rare it  knocks your socks, but it does happen sometimes and it's glorious when it does. There were pickles in the sandwich which seemed a little out of place. The tabouli and falafel were probably the best I've had. Grape leaves were good too. The hommus unfortunately was not that good... I would probably go back to this place, and based on my experience, I would order the falafel sandwich with a side of tabouli."}

This was our BEST "check please" experience to date!

THE FOOD: make plans to go more than once, because even with the combination plates, you'll want to go back again and again until you've tasted it all! Yes, yes, the Chicken Shawerma is ah-may-zing! And yes, the portion sizes are very big (most folks leave with to-go boxes, but it's also hard not to over-order with such tasty offerings all over the menu). But the combination plates, in my opinion, are the way to go. It's not just a little bit of this and that... it's a full serving of this and that, and everything is so delicious, you'll be amazed with every bit. From the warm, delicious stuffed grape leaves to the hummous to the kebabs to, well, everything!

THE DRINKS: I have to mention this briefly... I'm an iced tea fan and the tea here is wonderful. They are always so busy, I haven't slowed someone down to ask what the slightly sweet flavor is, but it's the tea itself, not a sweetener. Yum!

THE SHOP: the building is 2/3 restaurant, 1/3 store... don't forget to pick up some truly fantastic baklava and/or turkish delight at the back counter register when you pay after your meal... it may be the best sweet treats you've ever had.

WHEN TO GO: they get busy and you may have to wait a few minutes, but because they are also a store, you can browse the aisles for european/asian cookies and tea and such while you're waiting... and its all worth the wait. so really, it isn't when to go, it's why haven't you already? the chefs in the kitchen are masterful and the staff will make you feel right at home... and, of course, it's likely to be some of the best food you've ever had!"}

We decided to have lunch here after reading the glowing reviews for this place on yelp. At first glance, it looked like any other store in a strip mall but inside, it is divided into a store front & a restaurant. The space is clean & the service is excellent/attentive. 

our lunch consisted of a vegetarian combo plate(falafel x2, baba ganouj, tabbouleh, grape leaves x2) shish kabob plate(lamb kabob x5 pieces,rice, lettuce salad with tahini,1 Arabic bread) side of labni( kind of cream cheese), ful mudammas (mix of beans in a flavored curry sauce)- yes we were really hungry :)
In the veggie combo- The falafel was crispy, freshly made & grape leaves were unlike any I have eaten. The ful mudammas was tasty, well prepared/flavored without being spicy. In case of the shish kabob plate- the lamb was well cooked (I asked for medium done meat & that's what I was served) but it was bland. The portions are huge but prices are reasonable . 
Don't miss picking up some yummy middle eastern desserts from the store, to finish up your meal.  
We left Haji Baba, stuffed/content & with lotsa doggie bags!"}

Something about Haji Baba stirs up thoughts of romance... maybe its the lamb tongue sandwhich or the hummus platter.  Either way, be careful who you choose to dine with... you might just end up finding true love.

I'm a little sad it's so popular now and busy all the time but the restaurant deserves it. They haven't raised their prices and some of the waiters have been there for 10+ years. Their groceries are unique and well priced and I can't say enough good about their baklava. This place is home to me!"}

The minute you get to the parking lot you can already smell how great this food is. We started with feta cheese and pita bread and it was probably some of the best feta I've ever had. The best part is that they make their feta cheese fresh so you know it's not from some container they bought at the local store. I ended up getting the shish kabob, which essentially is the lamb kabob and it was out of this world. Perfectly cooked and served with a huge portion of rice and salad that was also great. The portions are great, atmosphere is cool, and the service very friendly. This is a place you need to check out especially if you're a first timer to middle eastern food!"}

My ex-boyfriend was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and swore this place had the best schwarma he'd ever had in the US. It is the basis for all my comparisons and I've never been as satisfied as when I get it here. It is uniformly amazing. Their grape leaves are also delicious and made with what must be fresh ones, not canned, as they have such a better texture than any others I've had. I have had better falafel elsewhere, but that's not what I come here for so I can't dock them any stars. And staff has become SO much friendlier than when I first started coming here (about 10 years ago). The grocery store also has a huge selection of the real deal. I'm so glad I made a point of coming by on my way to the airport. I'd have never forgiven myself if I missed out!"}

I always get the falafel sandwich and its always delicious and always cheap. The baba ganoush is also really tasty.

The location may be hard to find if you're not looking for it.  Half of the establishment is the actual cafe and the other half is like a mini mart for all things Middle Eastern.  When I have some time to spare I'll sit down and eat at the cafe and the waiter is always very polite. Most of the time though I just grab take out which is very convenient.  It never takes more than 10 minutes to get my food.  

Overall, I would highly suggest eating at Haji Baba if you love authentic Middle Eastern food and don't want to spend much money."}

Despite their success & the surplus of positive reviews, I no longer trust the food that they serve.

After receiving hummus with a teaspoon of olive oil, I asked if I could get some on the side. At first glance I immediately knew what was in the side dish was not olive oil. I smelt it--Nothing. No smell. I tasted it. Gross. Cooking oil. F*cking cooking oil. I buy olive oil. I lived in Lebanon for some time. The fact that the hummus only had a teaspoon of olive oil was irritating in itself. I could go on...

If you can't give me real olive oil, don't give me anything at all--or tell me I'd have to pay for it. Whatever. Don't give me sunflower oil and try to convince me that this is olive oil. 

Simply because I am a white American DOES NOT mean I don't know what the difference between cooking oil & olive oil is. I'm offended and disgusted. If you are looking for authentic Middle Eastern food, you are better off elsewhere. Support an honest businessman that has some integrity because it is clearly lacking here."}

I didn't go but my mom craved this place during our trip and went back a second time-this time with me.

So basically it's a store with a small kind-of restaurant inside. Serves middle eastern food, I am leaning towards more greek because of grape leaves and the gyros..

Anyhoo, I had a gyro which is lamb, a yogurt sauce, tomatoes and lettuce in a pita type bread. I absolutley cannot stand lamb, I refuse to eat it not because of the taste but...it's a lamb...a fuzzy cute...anyways...

YES I broke down and ate it. I was super starving and it didn't really taste like how I remembered when I first tried lamb...it was really good. My aunt had a veggie platter and everyone also had a gyro and my sister had a gyro platter.

I will come back here again when we visit the family, I think it is probably a staple and as for the lamb...probably the only time I will ever eat it, if it's in a gyro at Haji-Baba."}

I was very impressed by this restaurant, and also surprised that I had never even seen it. I'm not sure if the complex is new but its pretty well camouflaged. 

The food was VERY good. It came out in large portions and very quickly. They offer the usual Mediterranean fare, I ordered the Gyro plate, Georgeann G had the lamb tongue sandwich, and we each also had a stuffed grape leaf. The stuffed grape leaves we served hot (which was a first) but they were HUGE compared to others I've had. The Meat was cooked to perfection (the lamb tongue was surprisingly very tasty) and the sides were freshly prepared as well. 

Words of advice: go with the sandwich instead of a plate. The plate came with about 2 pounds of rice that was completely not needed (and the total price would've been much less if ordered separately). If you still want more, add a side salad or something.

The prices were very good and the service was nothing to complain about. It was hard to resist the baklava by the register, and we ended up taking a piece of cashew baklava to go (which was heavenly). 

I'm glad I've had a chance to check this place out, and I will definitely go back."}

For those of you who've been to Middle Eastern Bakery (or MEB as I often refer to it) on 16th Street in Phoenix, Haji in so many ways feels like MEB's twin.  Or perhaps MEB is Haji Baba's twin?  Anyways, I was looking for a place for dinner close to ASU's Gammage Auditorium in advance of going to see The Book of Mormon (fantastic Broadway show, btw), and came upon Haji as one of my bookmarked spots.  I'd talked to a number of ASU grads who'd raved about this place so around 6pm on a Friday night, I made my way in.

Like I said, the place felt perfectly familiar to me as a faithful MEB customer.  A grocery store and bakery up front with a sit down restaurant to the side.  The aroma of fresh baked goods mixed with the smells of cooked meats and seasonings from the grocery store permeating the air.  The place was unsurprisingly jam packed for dinner, but fortunately the wait for a table was less than 5 minutes.  One significant difference here at Haji versus MEB is that you wait in line for a table and the wait staff takes care of you until you pay at the front counter when you're done (whereas you order everything upfront at the counter at MEB).  The menu has a nice variety of salads, sandwiches and mixed plates consisting of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean influences, including plenty of healthy (and perhaps not so healthy) options to choose from.

I led off with the Hummus Tahini appetizer.  This Hummus was doused with lemon juice, garlic, olives, pickles, sesame seeds, and of course a healthy dose of olive oil.  The pita bread it came with was warm, pillowy soft and perfect for dipping.  I apologize for not getting a photo of this as I was so hungry from skipping lunch earlier in the day that I hoover'd this stuff.  My word this hummus dish was luscious.  I could've eaten a gallon of that hummus it was so good.  I also got an order of their lemonade with rose water.  And for those of you MEB loyalists who think MEB has the best lemonade with rose water out there, you can rest easy.  Haji's version of this drink is delicious and refreshing, but I would still give MEB the slight edge on this particular drink.  Now then for the main entree.  I had to watch my portion size a little bit this go around since I was going to have a theatre play to sit through for 3 hours.  The Sultani plate seemed like just the thing.  A steak kebab, a ground beef kebab, rice, salad, plus pita bread and grilled tomatoes (okay, so it was still a large portion, but I could've gone crazier).  The meats were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the rice (oh man that rice) had a buttery softness which acted as the perfect compliment.  I restrained myself from ordering dessert this go around, but great dinner all around.

Total cost for the lemonade, food, tax and tip came to $22.  Despite a busy night, I was in and out pretty quickly.  It's not hard to see why this place is so popular with locals and ASU students alike.  Great food, great staff, reasonable prices, in a relaxed casual neighborhood setup.  Being right along the light rail route is also a plus.  It is better than MEB?  Honestly, I'd call it a draw.  Both are awesome spots and I'd gladly go back to either anytime.  Phoenix has MEB & Tempe has Haji, so both cities have a spot to call their own.  Great Middle Eastern cuisine isn't always easy to find, so having two 5 star options in the valley is a big plus.  Next time I'm at Haji, its Baklava time."}

The shawarma is divine (best I've had in Arizona, and a close runner-up for all time) and the gyros are outstanding.  In fact, I've never had anything bad here.  I'm not even a huge tabbouleh fan, and I still wolf down Haji-Baba's.  On top of that, everything is pretty cheap and you get huge portions.  I can always get at least two meals out of one of their platters.

The place itself is a little unassuming storefront.  It's almost a diner feeling in the restaurant area.  It also has a pretty awesome little grocery where you can pick up a little bit of everything from fresh feta, hookah supplies and (my favorite) Kinder chocolates.  It can get a bit hectic at peak meal times (you pay up at the front in the grocery), but always worth it.  We've only had bad service once and even then, they were very good about making it up to us and gave us a free bakalava and mint tea for dessert.

Definitely give this place a try, even if you're not a fan of Middle Eastern food. It'll change your mind!"}

The shawarma plate comes with hummus, tabooli, rice, and pita. I like to mix mine all together as it creates a nice flavor combination. Other highlights are the hummus plate appetizer and the rose water lemonade. The babaganooj can be good but it is a bit unreliable here and sometimes it tastes very different than usual.

To be honest, I've had better Middle Eastern food; but what they offer, how much of it they give you, and the stellar service provided, easily makes this restaurant THE place to beat.  The most-memorable item on their menu is their dolmas, which, I admit, I didn't like when I first tried them, but have since fallen in love with:  fat, with a unique filling I can't really describe and served hot. ( If, like me, you are used to the small, cold, rice-filled dolmas, you really need to try these and keep an open mind.)   Typically, I get the vegetarian platter, which, like most of what they serve, comes with copious amounts of tabooli, hummus, felafel, yoghurt (sort of like tzatziki, but not quite), dolmas, etc.  If you have a big appetite -- and readers of my reviews know I'm gluttonous -- you will NOT be hungry when you leave this place!  My partner is a fan of their gyro sandwich, which, not surprisingly, is big and tasty.

Haji Baba also has a store taking up half the establishment offering a variety of foods and other items from the Middle East and Bosnia.  They also sell fresh Feta (get the Greek, not the Bulgarian), Burek (a cheese-filled pastry), decent baklava and many other things unavailable in the Valley at very reasonable prices.  Disadvantage (for me)?  They're all the way in Tempe; so if you live west of I-17, bring a book and lots of water for your haj across the Valley to get here!

One more important note:  I read, with much amusement, the review from someone complaining that she showed up here in an evening gown only to find out the place is "one step above a fast-food place."  Honestly, that's no exaggeration:  show up here overdressed and don't be surprised if you see people doubling-up in hysterical laughter and running to the bathroom to avoid peeing their pants.  Most of the customers frequenting Haji Baba are students from nearby ASU, local workers on lunch break and your average, every day 'proletariat', as I'm sure the complaining reviewer would refer to them as being.  Haji Baba is by no means fancy; but if you're looking for good food served by friendly employees, who work their rears off, moving fast to serve you and ensure you leave happy with your experience, then this is the place for you.  I've been coming here on and off for more than 15 years now and not once -- NOT ONCE -- have I ever had a complaint or issue with anything there.  If only for the fact I've had better Middle Eastern food in other, less worthy restaurants, I would've given them five stars."}

The grocery store is on point too. If you need spices they are 10 times cheaper than anything you will get in the major grocery chains of the same stuff. 

They serve Pepsi and not coke it's refreshing. They always have bottles of sriracha hot sauce on tap and goes well with the food. Again this is a must have on a regular basis.

Food is all fresh, cheap, filling and delicious. You can call ahead and pick up at the counter or just grab one of the tables to the right of where you walk in, if they are all occupied you just stand kind of by door (but not blocking it) and wait. Once a table leaves and you are up next an employee will run and clear off and wipe down the table and signal you over. I would call the service style at the tables "fast paced table service" which is totally fine, the server may not always be able to answer your questions but that has it's benefits as it might get you to take a chance and try something new. 

That's what happened to me when I finally decided to try the Lamb Tongue Gyro, a decision that forever changed my life. I know a lot of you are thinking right now that it sounds gross, I mean lamb... tongue...? That's what most everyone thinks till they try it, it's amazing! The meat itself is so tender and juicy, the texture is closer to really tender grilled steak than anything else. The taste is somewhat similar to like dark meat chicken/turkey or maybe even duck just not quite as rich. It's hard to explain but that's why you just have to give it a shot. Plus, even though it's one of the most expensive things on their menu, it's still only like $6.50, and it's a full meal! This applies to basically everything else on their menu, chicken shawarma is another very popular dish that you can't go wrong with. 

The building also doubles as a Middle Eastern deli/bakery/small grocery store. They has all kinds of cool products from the Middle East, tons of great spices, some amazing meats and pastries. Basically, it's got everything you could ever want and then some.

Food. Good. But not award winning. I ate the kabob plate. Meat was juicy but lacked any spices. Rice was very plain in comparison to other middle eastern and kabob / gyro restaurants. 

My dinner guest had the kibbi plate. Again the value was great but the flavor was bland and spiceless.

Went today for lunch with the SO.  We had about a 10 minute wait, which was enough to wander around the grocery store and check out the extensive spice selection.

After being seated, we selected the veggie combo plate and the sultani plate.  There was a TON of food, talk about value! the baba ganoush (smoky eggplant) was spot on perfect, and the pita bread that accompanied it was toasted and warm, which was a great touch!  Tabouleh was also really good, and the falafel was moist and had a great texture.  The only meh item on the veggie combo plate was the grape leaves - they were warm, but didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  In contrast, the koobideh and the grilled beef were extremely flavorful.  The meal plate came with salad as well as rice, but the meat was definitely the star.

Service was friendly and perfunctory.  A no frills, here for the food, leave with a belly ache because you ate so much land of goodness!"}

Okay... other food.  Right.  Their gyro meat is very well done, and if I have any criticism, it would be they slice their gyro meat off the spit in much too large of slices.  It's not overseasoned or particular greasy, very tender.  When ordering with the plate, it comes with a side salad on house dressing and a helping of rice.  There's nothing particularly to the rice and they offer way, way too much - enough for several days worth of leftovers.  I'm also not too impressed with the side salad - the dressing is a bit salty and my salad was overdressed.

The falafel are fantastic.  Crispy, slightly crumbling, slightly moist, great for some delicious hummus dipping.

Haji-Baba is part sit-down restaurant, part counter-service restaurant, part Middle Eastern market, and it all somehow makes total sense when you step inside.  Prices are excellent.  Service is friendly.  A casual, inexpensive place to grab lunch or pick up some snacks."}

The platters are delicious and the portions are HUGE for only $8.99 - definitely had enough leftovers for a whole other meal. I got the gyro plate, which comes with gyro meat, pita, salad, and rice. The meat by itself is slightly salty but everything combined tastes amazing. The dressing on the salad was also pretty unique. My friends got the chicken shawarma plate, which comes with chicken, pita, hummus, tabouli, and rice, and loved it as well. Their only critique was that the garlic sauce was a bit strong, so avoid if you don't like garlic.

The atmosphere is... are you seriously concerned with the atmosphere at a freaking gyro place? Did you not read the part about delicious gyro meat and huge chunks of feta cheese? Well, it's slightly more upscale than a cart in the middle of the sidewalk. By "upscale" i mean indoors.  Sometimes they have tables and chairs for you to sit on, sometimes they put the chairs on top of the table so you don't. Sometimes they have servers to take your order, sometimes you have to order from the counter. It's all a crap shoot. What's not a crap shoot is that you are getting a heaven in a pita for less than $5. Freaking incredible."}

The prices on the spices were amazingly cheap and I bought several other spice items for when I do Indian based cooking (lentils are good for you but man they need some spices to taste interesting).

I had the good fortune to talk with the owner of the establishment. He told me the prices are so affordable because he deals with ethnic clientele  who use lots of spices and simply will not pay the sort of prices one sees in most stores. However, he assured me that he buys his spices in small batches (like 5 pounds) and then breaks them up himself and he checks everything when it comes in, if it doesn't smell fresh he sends it back and noted that he has a large base of customers that just buy from him for the spices. 

My challenge, of course, is I don't know much at all about Middle Eastern cooking but if you are going to do it, this seems the place to buy the ingredients."}

I took the opportunity to have lunch here last Friday since the wife had an appointment at a tattoo place just around the corner, forcing us to drive all the way from Surprise. I was like "Holy sh1t, Haji Babas is supposed to be around here somewhere" while Google Mapping the tat shop location.

Now, I'm no stranger to dinge. I grew up in an "old" city, and Sydney and outlying suburbs has its fair share of dingy places, perhaps topped by Gould's Book Arcade in Newtown. First impression of Haji Babas is that it's a dingy, hole in the wall establishment. So far, so good right? Basically it's divided up into a mini ethnic supermarket featuring stuff like Cock Cola (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=1dl1l6baJJdY7q53V-V7uw) and Patak's, one of my favourite Indian marinade and grill sauce brands. Ibbida ibbida WHAT? Indian in an Arabic grocery? Yep, but that's not where the Indian surprises end - stay tuned! The other section has a selection of cheap tables and chairs, the likes of which made even the decor at Chino Bandido's look opulent by comparison. Still, I was quite comfortable with it all. We sat down and had a look at the menu. Lots of familiar stuff, so in order to make a good comparison with other similar places I've eaten at, I ordered the hummus dip and vegetarian platter.

First thing that struck me was that the initial babaghannoush plate was VERY good. Nothing beats the hummus/bbg from my home town's "Istanbul on King", but I'm going to say that this was probably the second best I've had - high praise from me - with lots of oil on top. The vegetarian platter was also quite good. It came with a side of raita, which was a little odd. No, it wasn't tzatziki. Although perhaps it was raitziki, or tzaita. The wife took one dip of it and proceeded to exclaim that it was the best raita she had ever had. I'd probably say that's true - it was just the right consistency, and had unusually large pieces of dill pickle in it. No, not cucumber. I did my cooldown test with the pita, it didn't get leathery (unlike Chicago Gyros') so another thumbs up there. I have two minor complaints, though. The dolmas were hot. I HATE hot dolmas, I don't know who invented the idea but all I've ever eaten for three decades in Oz has been the cold stuff. Never even KNEW they came in a heated variety until I arrived stateside. Perhaps the cold ones are an option, who knows. I'll find out next time I'm here. Because I'm definitely coming back. Last complaint, the falafels. They weren't as good as the Greek Wraps ones, and actually fairly salty. Strangely enough, my plate came with a small side of hummus, but it was different to what I'm used to - it had a yellowish tinge to it whereas typically it's a kind of off-white (added pinch of turmeric or saffron?) and the combo of falafels with it was a little too salty for my taste. Not enough to knock off a star though.

The wife had a chicken shishkabob with a giant amount of rice and salad - so much that she was stuffed and her plate didn't even look a quarter empty. Excellent value for money. I had a mouthful of her rice and would give it my vote for the most properly-cooked, fluffy basmati I've had in a LONG time. We did a once-through in the grocery area before we left and picked up some Patak marinades. And I couldn't leave without a piece of cashew baklava. Good, not the best I've had but pretty good. They have a couple of kid's chocolates up the front, the kid enjoyed that in the car despite getting half of it on his pants and the seat.

The prices are incredibly reasonable. I was seeing some things for three, four dollars. If it weren't for the fact that this place is almost 50 miles from where I live I'd eat here every few days. Why can't they open something like this in Surprise? We don't even have an INDIAN restaurant closer than eighteen or so miles away. You CenPho and Tempe locals should consider yourselves d4mn lucky.

Big thumbs up for Haji Babas. If the owners are reading this, set up another location in the west valley for pete's sake! I need to go back here and get a handle on the dips and tastes and stuff because evidently these guys are giving their own little spin to middle eastern cuisine, at least as far as my experience goes. If I'm still learning, that's a good thing. Next time I'm going to see what the difference is between their "pita" and their "hand-made pita". It's just unfortunate that it's going to be a very rare treat for me due to distance."}

Most of us are very familiar with Middle Eastern food so we had a pretty good idea of what to get and how things should taste. 

First, it's a small place, with tables sort of thrown into an add-on to a Mid-Eastern market, so larger parties may have an issue getting seated right away. It took them almost 20 minutes to seat us, but that's not entirely their fault. I mean, you have to work with what you've got, right? Just be prepared to wait if there's more than, say, 5 or so in your group.

The market is kind of nifty, so take the time to browse if you get there and are waiting for a table or for people to show up. Lots of spices, and you can ogle the half dozen different types of baklava they have up front. Yes, I said half a dozen. Pistachio, walnut, pecan, almond, and a couple others. They also have Bulgarian feta, which I haven't had since I left Bangkok, and I highly recommend if you're a fan of Greek feta. I'll be going back for a nice big chunk, this I can promise you. 

Now the food: My partner's two boys are two of the pickiest eaters I know, so we got them the chicken kebab sandwich. I didn't get to try it, but they both finished their plates, so I'll take that as a positive testimonial. My partner and I shared a variety of things: gyros, kebab, chicken shwarema, rice, hummus (which on the menu is spelled "homos," much to the amusement of the kids), and tabouli, with homemade pita bread. My cousins both got the veggie platters and I honestly don't remember what my uncle got. :) The gyros and kebab were phenomenal, extremely flavourful, and the gyros was the best I'd had in a long time. I think the chicken shwarama was my favourite though. It almost melts in your mouth and the flavours are fantastic. The hummus was very good, especially with the homemade pita. (Definitely pay the extra for the "real" stuff. Store bought just doesn't cut it here.) I'm not really a huge fan of tabouli, but my partner seemed to like it well enough. One great little surprise for me were the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). A traditional Greek dish, I'm never really a fan. My dad makes these by the bucketful and freezes them. Usually, for me, they tend to be bitter and too bland, but I got to try one off of one of the veggie plates and it was actually REALLY good. I honestly think it may have been the best dolmades I've ever had. So I'd recommend it. 

To drink I took a risk and got the yogurt soda. Anyone familiar with Indian food will most likely have tried lassi at one point of another.... this is NOT lassi. This is definitely an acquired taste, but if you want to try something different, give it a shot. It is literally plain, unsweetened yogurt with soda water. No one else at my table liked it, but I thought it was different and in its own way, rather refreshing. 

We shared the pistachio and pecan baklava at the end of the meal. Fresh, homemade and soooooo good! 

I have lots of reasons to go back, one of which would be the bill at the end of the night. Keep in mind, there were 4 of us on our tab, 2 kebab sandwiches, 3 drinks, my yogurt soda, the chicken shwarama plate, a kebab, a gyros and 2 baklava and it all came up to about $35. You really can't beat that."}

They offer all of the Mediterranean favorites for a very reasonable price.  Although I have my favorite Mediterranean places for different dishes, I come to Haji Baba when I want a quick, cheap bite.  You can dine in for under $7 and get in and out in less than 30 minutes.  

The ambiance is typical of the standard hole-in-the-wall middle eastern eatery.  During lunch time it gets busy, I have seen people waiting for a table to open up.  The wait staff is a loyal bunch that has worked there for years and it is always nice to see their familiar faces.  The hummus is good and the kalamatas are always a delicious treat.  I highly recommend ordering the homemade pita (not on the menu) with your hummus or your pita sandwich....Haji's finest:)  The Greek salad leaves much  to be desired as it consists solely of iceberg with the usual Greek veggies.  Eat here for the sandwiches or plates, not the salads.  In the grocery you can get a variety of inexpensive spices, olive oil, fresh olives, feta and many other tantalizing treats.  And don't forget to try one of the many different types of Baklava that they make as you are checking out!!  My favorite is the almond or the pecan....yummm!"}

I was introduced to Haji Baba during my college years - almost 20 years ago.  

Hands down, it is the BEST middle eastern food around and the prices can't be beat.  We moved to Utah about 10 years ago and searched for food that was as tasty as it is here.  At the end of the meal, we would say, "well, it was okay, but it's no Haji Baba."  When we decided to move back to Arizona, the first place we went for lunch out was Haji Baba!  It continues to be delicious.

I also love the market that is inside.  I buy all of my feta here as well as greek olives.  They have awesome prices on the feta and olives as well as spices that can be hard to find elsewhere.  

There are several things worthy of complaining about, but the food is so good that it makes it all worth it.  This place is very popular, which makes it difficult to find a table during peak times.  Lunch is crazy busy!  The service in the restaurant leaves something to be desired.  It's pretty bare bones and definitely not at all like the nice chain greek restaurants (think My Big Fat Greek....)  We no longer eat in the restaurant, we now go for take out.  This place does a huge amount of take out so call your order in ahead of time.

Great food, good portion sizes, great prices.

I don't know why we keep trying different middle eastern food restaurants, it's Haji Baba's gyros that we always wish we had eaten instead!  Nothing is better!"}

The chicken was good but it wasn't the real shawarma I was looking forward to knowing that this is a Mediterranean place.

I'm really confused as to how I don't have a review for this place already. After living in Tempe/Phoenix for over 20 years, I remember craving gyros from Haji Baba even as a kid. In fact, I would venture to say Haji Baba and Baiz Market are the oldest, quality middle eastern shops in the valley.

Apparently my friend has never been here before, and I decided I would be a terrible friend if I never took him. Of course, he had trouble finding it because he thought it was a restaurant "restaurant" and not a hole-in-the-wall type place.

We were seated even though it was lunch, didn't take more than 10 minutes for our gyro plates to come out which were piled high with succulent gyro meat. To perfectly complement the star of the dish, there was white rice and a salad with plenty of unique dressing. Gyro meat by itself is usually amazing, simply because its meat, but when its accompanied with an amazing sauce, it really becomes stellar. The "white sauce" or what I think is an iteration of tsaziki sauce is perfect for the juicy ground lamb meat. If you haven't had gyro before and you want to give a try, I would definitely get the gyro plate at Haji Baba.

I almost forgot to mention that you can't leave Haji Baba without trying their baklava. Take your pick at which nuts you want. pistachio, almonds, walnuts, mixed, etc. 

Aside from their restaurant food, my family usually buys groceries from here. One of our staples is pita bread, and you can usually get a box of pita bread for like $13. Freeze some of it, and use the rest as you wish. It goes perfectly with store bought hummus and foul (fava beans)."}

Since then, I've been there five times and have tried nearly everything on the menu. The food is delicious! Seriously, there hasn't been one thing I've tried that I haven't enjoyed.

On my first trip, I ordered the combination. I highly recommend doing this if you've never eaten here before. This plate gives you a great sampling of what their menu has to offer and a generous portion at that. It's easily enough for two people and, at only around $12, a great deal too.

On my most recent visit, I had the Gyro plate; again amazing! A very generous portion served with a delicious salad, a side of rice, and I topped the meal off with an Arabic coffee.

Haji-Baba is not really a secret and the place will get very busy at lunch time. If you want to eat there, go for an early or late lunch, otherwise you'll have to wait for a table; it's worth it!

They have a large menu and great prices, and if you don't have time to stay and eat, you can order to-go from the counter.

The staff do a good job, but their food is so good, I'd still eat there if a server punched me in the face every time I walked in the door.

My sister had the chicken schwarma, of which I had a bite and the chicken was tender and flavorful.

I had the combination combination plate.  The gyro meat was very savory and my favorite part of the meal.  The grape leaves, with the warm orange rice, were the best I've ever had.  The falafel were average.  Too much crunch and not enough flavor.  The tabooli was the perfect complement to the savory meat.  I'm not a huge kibbeh fan, but it was decent.  The sambousek was delicious.  

Good service.  Next time I go, I want a tour of the grocery store."}

Delicate blend of spices where no one thing is overpowering; a symphonic balance of flavors that melds perfectly. 

Their iced tea is refreshingly strong, with more than a hint of cinnamon. Guys behind the counter at the to-go/deli are quite opinionated and will not hesitate to steer customers toward their favorites. I like that."}

Now onto the rest of my review, I met a friend for lunch, I started by ordering the Hummus and a Spanakopita (see pics) 

The hummus was good, although I didn't get the the thick fresh pita I saw everyone else eating? I guess you have to ask for the good stuff,  Newbie mistake #1, the pita I got wasn't too bad though.

The Spanakopita wasn't all that it, tasted too "green" not enough flavor of feta, and by microwaving  it  the flaky crust became unflaky and jut soft and chewy, not good.

I ordered the Vegetarian Combo she ordered the Shawarma plate (see pics) My plate had babaganoush, falafel (hiding under the tomato salad) Tabbouleh and 2 stuffed grape leaves served with a side of yogurt / tatziki sauce. 
I thought everything was really good and tasted pretty fresh except the grape leaves, they were atrocious, the rice inside was unrecognizable, it was so overcooked it completely turned to a mushy paste, bummer, grape leaves are my favorite. ( I will make them for us Andrea, I Promise)

I wish I had more of their falafel I pretty much filled up on the tatziki, babaganoush and pita. Now I know what to get next time.

So our waiter come over and says "Since this is your first time, I'll take care of the bill, just take your ticket to the counter"

WOW~ Are you serious, how generous!!

We wait in line, give our ticket to the guy and he keeps asking us to pay??? 
Well Apparently  there was a confusion of some sort, I don't know what the waiter meant by that, We though our lunch was going to be free.....it wasn't....but that's OK.

That's when I ordered my baklava, one piece.........I go to the car to eat it and went back in for 2 more pieces.....YUM!!

4 stars for the Baklava at least"}

The only thing I wish for is another couple pita breads... one to dip in my hummus and one to eat with the gyro meat!  I struggled mightily not giving this place 5 stars.

I went in for lunch and though it was busy and I was alone, I still got seated and served pretty quickly. 

I love the falafel pita and tabouli. The tea was good for just a hot tea as well. Maybe it's the atmosphere that makes it all so good? Or maybe it's that they do what they know and do it well? For me, this is a staple in the valley for middle eastern cuisine. It warms my heart that after all of these years they're still there and seem to do well. 

The tahini is perfect, the falafel is perfect I love the halva. 

They have a market area with many items that I'm familiar with growing up in Toronto and I've been surprised what I've seen there although admittedly, I believe the only thing I've ever purchased are the seamen snaps.

Anyhow, I imagine Haji-Baba will always be a favorite of mine even though the staff behind the counter aren't always the most chipper I've encountered, it's just that good."}

Place reminded me of little Asian market.  Disorganized and cluttered.  I was very skeptical about this place, but I read yelp review and figure what can it go wrong.... Right?

Well, waited 40 mins to get my food, because they forgot my order.  Chicken was burnt.  I mean it was so black, I thought I was eating a charcoal.

I made small compliant to them, they offered to give me $3 off the tab..  I would of been more pleased if they remade my food, but they were closing.  So $3 off the tab was the only option they given me..

Salad was decent.  Fresh and great dressing.  Hummus was decent.  Little salty and sour compared to others.  
Rice was okay, nothing special.  

Food was about average to me.  I had a better experience eating at "Greek wrap" on bell road.  

I don't think I will be returning to this place after the experience I've encountered.  It is not worth of waiting 15 mins for seating, getting over cooked food, and not getting my order for 40 mins.  

Maybe next time, they will get my order correct, however, it is not worth the trip for average food.."}

First off, it's Middle Eastern food.  Second, the prices are very very reasonable.  Third, no matter how long it's been since my last visit, they always remember me. 

I have had a lot of items on the menu, but I typically gravitate towards the Greek salad (lettuce, tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumber, fat chunks of sheep milk feta, and their AMAZING dressing) $5.99 for a large salad that includes some pita.  I also really enjoy their vegetarian plate, which comes with: falafel, tzatziki, pita, tabooli, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush (but I sub for hummus). $7.99 for two meals worth of food!!  Any and all dining cohorts have equally enjoyed their food selections, and usually go back for more:) In addition to all the veg options, they also have chicken/lamb/beef stuffs and they even have a tongue sandwich! (Ew to me, yum to people I know).  I really dig their beverage options: pomegranate juice, sodas, iced tea with a familiar flavor that I can't quite figure out, yogurt soda, lemonade flavored with rose water (my favorite!).  

In addition to having delicious food, great service and low prices, they also have a grocery store on the opposite side of the restaurant.  It's great!  Lots of great ingredients that are hard to find in a regular grocery store.  They even have all the fixings for your hookah enthusiasts.  

The walls are adorned with "Best of Phoenix" awards dating back to the 80's, and it's no wonder.  

I give them two BIG thumbs up!"}

Stepping into the tiny grocery/cafe, i was washed in delicious smells of curry and every imaginable spice. My dad chose this place for dinner as it conveniently sells leg of lamb (our family's traditional Christmas eve main course). 

Myself, my dad & mom, my sister and 7-year old niece found a relatively comfortable table and set up shop. While we waited for menus, my sister & I eagerly gazed at the shelves of exotic foods just a few paces away. After selecting a wide variety of menu items, my sister and I bolted for the grocery area while my dad entertained my niece. 

My sister found some curry pastes and I goggled at the biryani rice mix, the watermelon jam, and the super-cheap olive oil. I love places like this! 

Our meal came quite quickly, so we barely made it through the 3 small aisles. We rushed back to the table to dig in. 

I ordered a gyro on the side to keep for lunch the next day (was it really $3.50 for this massive thing??) My mom ordered a falafel sandwich (she's a vegetarian most of the time), dad started in on his shwarma sandwich (the beef was shredded and tasted like machaca; very flavorful!). My niece is a picky eater but our server accommodated and instructed the kitchen to create a "chicken-on-a-stick." She had a disbelieving, almost grossed-out, expression on her face when it was placed before her (it was basted in a mild yellow curry). After trying the meat, she devoured most of it (we were SO proud!). 

The piece d' resistance was the combo platter that my sis & I shared. Gyro meat with the lovely cucumber sauce, 2 falafel (some of the best I've ever had, light, fluffy, melt-in-your mouth), a huge serving of taboli (sp?) salad, 2 warm dolmas (delicious!), an odd little tasty cake (i know it has a name but I'm too lazy to search for it) that had seasoned ground beef sandwich between layers of a slightly sweet wheat cake. Finally, my favorite, the deep fried beef eggroll. The meat was amazingly seasoned but the wrapping was that sweet dough. My sister described it as "pumpkin pie except with beef." Weird combo, but Divine!!! 

I'm going back & taking my friends....there are 5 kinds of baklava that we have to try!!!"}

 I'm so sorry to do this. I wanted this place to be the Gem that I just found at the pho place next door. It was not! Sooooo, let me get to it. First BEWARE the "yogurt soda" . This is definately something you would have to spend alot of time with. It is exactly what it says it is. Imagine plain, unsweetened yogurt, you drop in plain, unflavored unsweetened soda water in and then add a tablespoon of salt. Sound good. Fuck no! And it is not.  Next.....!
 Falafel: Meh! The croquettes could have been crispier on the outside and definately need a lot more flovor to these heavenly middle-eastern balls of goodness. The pickle was actually the best part.  The pita is NOT MADE FRESH!! Some reviews say they are but I can tell you the pita's came from a bag.
 Gyro: Meh! The reason for the cone shaped meat loaf of lamb and beef is so the outside cooks quickly buy turning past extremely high heat and the inside stays moist as it is sliced away from the cone. In my Gyro there were no cooke meat ends, in fact it was just inside Gyro meat. I assume this is because they are busy and the outside meat was never given a chance to cook up again.....you see the inside becomes the outsude every slice of the way. I did not have nearly enough tzatziki, no cucumbers, no olive, no red onion. All essential in creating a tasty ass Gyro. I still contend that Jay's Gyros in Tempe are supreme!! 
Lamb Tongue Sandwich: Lettuce, Tomato, Tongue wrapped in a bagged pita!! Boring. Dry. The Lamb Tongue is served in the pita WHOLE. I thought it would be sliced but it was'nt. Two little lamb tongue's boiled with ZERO flavor.
Baba Gahnoush: OK.........
Hummus: OK.......
(Pita Jungle has a much heartier flavor on both items)
Baklavah: We have a winner!!!! Some of the best I have tasted in recent memory. That will be my reason for a follow up. 
I thought it was cool that they sold prayer mat's. The service is ok, nothing bad and nothing over the top."}

And at prices not much higher than fast food, you absolutely cannot beat the value here.  Great, delicious, quality food at a great price, plus a bonus: the people are wonderful.  Haji-Baba ftw!"}

Actually my favorite thing to get is over at the deli/takeout counter - the great selection of freshly made baklavas - almond, walnut, pistachio.  

This is also a good place to pick up spices and other Middle Eastern groceries.

Although I think I like the pickled papaya dish at the Vietnamese place in the plaza more, so my preference is to come here for the baklava afterwards."}

I decided to take the BF for dinner recently when we were in the Tempe area.  I was pleased that Haji-Baba has stood the test of time.

The decor was exactly as I remembered it.  The market side was still chock-full of Middle Eastern staples.  The bakery case was filled to the brim with homemade baklava.  The dining area even had the same murals on the walls.  Very little has changed indeed at Haji-Baba in the last 10 years.

Haji-Baba offers great value-for-your-dollar.  You get a large quantity of tasty food for a very wallet-friendly price.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't the greatest Middle Eastern food served in the US, but it's very solid.  There's a reason Haji-Baba has been a staple with ASU students over the years.  

The hummus was tasty and so were the olives.  The Gyro Plate had so much meat on it that I had to take half to go for lunch the next day.  The gyro meat is very good here, but it's not the best I have ever tasted.  That was at Jimmy's Gyros in Mykonos, Greece.  But I can certainly make do with Haji-Baba."}

I strongly suggest trying the pretzel bites. Beware it comes with a basket full. I'm talking like 15 of them and they are not small. The cheese it comes with is white and they warm it with a candle. So yummy!! 

After we all shared the pretzel bites and crusty bread (also yummy) we were basically full so my bf and I decided to split the Club sand which. We both liked it and they brought it to us on two separate plates cut perfectly in half with separate fries. Very accommodating!

My table got the chicken nachos and thai chicken wings, which were both adequate--wings were tasty, but small and bony. Beer selection was pretty good as well, and wait staff was very helpful in finding us beers that we would enjoy. Portion sizes were good.

Our server definitely seemed like he was trying a little too hard to be friendly. Service was slow--our waiter took a long time to materialize after we sat down, and the food took forever to come out. Yet our waiter would linger for excessive periods of time and make weird, desperate jokes when he did decide to grace our table with his presence. I am probably being overly critical, but I found it a little odd.

I know that the cheese dip and pretzel bites are absolutely to die for--I had them at the Scottsdale location once, but resisted chasing the dragon on this visit. I recommend getting that if you want an appetizer.

Atmosphere is pretty good. The decor is lovely--I love the tables and chairs especially. But even as an design student in my early 20's I thought the whole vibe of the place was a bit too hipster-y for my tastes. Good place for mustache and beard spotting, though."}

Culinary Dropout hits all the right notes with its delicious food. Take great ingredients, interesting compositions, and beautiful presentation and you have CDO. 

The place can be quite boisterous as it gets later on in the day. Sit at the bar if you're dining alone and have a few beers or some wine. There's local Arizona beer as well as canned beers in paper bags. 

Don't miss the charcuterie. It's only $5 for a healthy one-ounce serving of any of these meats. It's sliced paper thin, almost transparent, leaving the flavor no space to hide. Prosciutto is classic. A supplement of $8 is what it'll cost you for the Jamon Iberico, a truly special kind of meat that comes from special, acorn-fed Spanish black Iberian hogs that will leave you hungry for more. Rarely do I see it offered at restaurants but when I do, I always order it. You should too, as their slicing technique is perfect and the meat is perfectly salty and flavorful.

I also ordered the special (very limited) Korean style ribeye-cap. Ribeye cap is the fattier end piece of ribeye that is normally discarded after grilling or broiling a whole ribeye steak, but the kitchen does wonders with it, recognizing with a keen eye that we should not treat it as a second-class cut of meat. Instead, they marinate it in soy, ginger, garlic, spicy Korean paste (gochujang), and other aromatics, grill it until nicely charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside, and serve it dressed with sliced zucchini, bean sprouts, beech mushrooms, onions, cilantro, raw garlic, and more of the soy dressing. The raw garlic is amazing, providing a zip and delivering a respectful nod towards authentic Korean BBQ.

"Yesterday's soup" also caught my eye -- the name on the menu is meant to do that. The name will definitely solicit questions; maybe they should change it. But I enjoyed a bowl of chicken noodle, rich with flavor, as if my grandmother had been simmering a pot of chicken bones for hours. My only complaint is that the white meat in the soup was dry and flavorless. In the future, maybe the kitchen will learn that tender chicken meat in soup is welcome (either dark meat or white meat that's just perfectly cooked).

In any case, the service is wonderful, the space is lively and noisy, and the food is amazing. I'm looking forward to visiting again and seeing what a culinary dropout can do."}

I built a website for his restaurant WildFlower Grill when I used to work for the Arizona Daily Star.  Now his empire has vastly grown and includes Culinary Dropout.

With my first time being here, we met up with some friends here for lunch. My wife and I usually split entrees when we go out.  When we are on vacation, we don't really like to take "home" leftovers (i.e. back to the hotel).  We split the Shaved Prime Rib Dip sammich and it was honestly one of the best I have ever had.  The bread was soft, instead of hard and crunchy like most other places I've tried.

My friend had the Green Chile Stew.  The server really talked it up so he was expecting it to be amazing, but it was just good (which isn't bad).

My one gripe with these new, trendy restaurants is the choice is seating.  The metal chairs are painful to sit on...no padding whatsoever.  This is a big deal and factors in my decision to ever come back.  They do have couch-style seating which is much better.  Some of the couches surround fire-pits which is really nice to have when it's chilly.

A note on parking:  we parked in the "front" of what we thought was the restaurant.  It turns out the restaurant is in the far back of the building.  Park on the side where there is another entrance to CD.  

Also, this place goes by another name:  The Yard at Farmer's District.  I believe it's the outdoorsy area where you can play shuffle board, cornhole and other games.  There's also a bar behind the play area.  It even has it's own Yelp page, which curiously enough - also points to Culinary Dropout.

Overall, we had a good experience.  The beers were cold, service was prompt and the food delicious.  Just remember to bring  a seat pad with you if you decide to visit ;-)"}

I went with a recommended burger black and blue style and I had it wrapped in lettuce. Amazing taste. Loved the pickle and salad. I hope to come back next trip and experiment with the menu. Great service also."}

Truth be told, I was intrigued by the name of this place, but was even more impressed by the ambience and definitely the food.  

The space was huge and can be overwhelming, so we headed to the bar where full service and immediate access to cocktails await us.  To beat the heat, we immediately ordered a couple of refreshing cocktails and was completely satisfied by the pomegranate yuzu mule --- refreshing!  But what really did it for me was the "after school special" -  a concoction made with raspberry tea infused tequila, homemade ginger agave, lime, and modelo especial.  

The menu did not disappoint either.  We started with the prosciutto deviled eggs (delish), and the completely addicting cheddar cracklins!  My entree choice may appear to be plain but I can assure you there was nothing basic about the shrimp kale caesar salad that I completely inhaled, and my cannot-be-impressed husband said that the turkey pastrami sandwich was served on the best pretzel bread he'd ever had - [mic drop]!  

We loved it so much that we returned for brunch on our last day in AZ but at Phoenix location.  There are several locations in the area but you never forget your first love so it will have to be Tempe for me :)"}

But I thought I'd give this location another shot considering Fox restaurants usually have favorable reviews. So I was trying to book a party of 14 on a Saturday evening and called around all over the valley. I was denied several times (Thirsty Lion was incredibly rude on top of it. Uggg.) until I called Culinary Dropout. The hostess on the phone was great to work with and they were very accommodating with my party's size. Thankfully majority of my party arrived on time (we were here on 3/25/17). The food was great! We really enjoyed the soft pretzels and cheese and the pork belly nachos were amazing. Nobody in my party complained about their food and the prices were what we expected. So I'm dropping a star because of our server Megan. She did take our order and got our food delivered to us with no issues. The problem was she wanted nothing to do with us. We tried to make her laugh and we thanked her many times over. But never once did she make us feel welcome. Not one smile and super uptight. Everyone at our table kept saying "what's her deal?". It was a real downer to have her as our server other than getting our order right (btw ... I was a food server for many years back in the day and no stranger to customer service). But we did have a blast in the patio area playing cornhole. You just need to drop your ID off at the host stand for the bags. So thank you Culinary Dropout for taking us in, for the yummy food and for making it a fun night to celebrate. Please do me a favor and reevaluate your server staff."}

I tried to give this place a few different chances at different hours in order to really get a better understanding of what is going on with the service. It is always bad from what I have experienced, it did not matter the time of day or the day of the week it just is not good. I enjoy the food though so it did make me come back after having a few different bad experiences with the service. The food is always tasty with a lot of flavors and interesting menu.

The bartenders are so slow, heard the couple next to us saying that they were chatting with each other over taking orders for the last 3-5 minutes. Ordered a Whiskey/Coke and it took over 10 minutes to get it to me. The bartender was rather passive aggressive taking everyone's order. I never let one time dictate my overall opinion of an establishment but this has been over the course of 5 times going here. The food is not worth having to deal with this service so I would choose other places where the customers are appreciated more."}

We got seated quicker than 30 minutes and Wyatt our waiter was right there  getting our drink orders and explaining the menu. We were sitting at a round wooden table with really comfortable chairs. The atmosphere is very fun, but loud. What do you expect from a packed restaurant.  I could hear my husband so the noise level didn't interfere with our conversation.  Dinner OMG, we started with the pretzels and cheese. About 20 soft round pieces of pretzel which just about melted in your mouth.  I got the meatloaf which was the best meatloaf I have had in the Phoenix area.  My husband had a late lunch and he had the grinder. We really enjoyed ourselves.  They do have live music and other events.  I definitely want to go back with a whole group of friends. Good food, great services (thanks Wyatt) good times."}

I had: fried chicken entree 
Hubby: Korean beef entree
4 yr old: buttered noodles w/fries

Well we all finished our plates! We enjoyed our food so we will be back for sure. This time though I might have to bring my own hot sauce since their only options are tobacco cholula and sriracha, & you just Can't have fried chicken and Not have Louisiana hot sauce!! So that was disappointing but the chicken was still delicious. The batter is slightly sweet & im not a big fan of sweet entrees but this was subtle and the chicken was tender & juicy so I have to say that I liked it more than LoLo's. Which I'm sure is a big statement for some people. Lol my biscuit Was (I capitalize because I ate that $hit up!) fluffy, buttery, & sweet. 
4 year old daughter ate everything up which is rare so we are happy that money wasn't wasted! Shell type of noodles, a pretty good serving size & Parmesan was easy to eat. 
Hubby says his plate was amazingly tasty. Period. He was satisfied so overall we had a great experience. 
Service was good. He (Conner) had quite a few tables so I just had to make sure not to forget anything when he did come around."}

Atmosphere just as others described. From Moulin Rough light fixture to the bright red long 70's style couch & the hipster vibe. Kinda cool and unusual.
Menu has many offerings. The most popular appetizer has to be the Pretzel fondue! We weren't huge fans of the bread/ balsamic: pretty basic and the bread was to over done.

Our server was good, friendly personality. With that said, had a lot to deal with & only some support from other staff when presenting the meals.I would have to say it was very slow from start to finish, but I give her tons of credit. The assistance were attentive at refilling waters. The things that took "way to long" : our bar drinks, requests were forgotten ( like my side of ranch & husbands beer ) our main dishes from the kitchen, our bills were so slow to complete at the end of our dining experience!

I had the fried chicken, it was somewhat of a disappointment. Over cooked & dry. 3 pieces- breast, thigh & drum. The breast wasn't a full size (like 1/2) there was bones throughout. The honey drizzle: couldn't even find or really even taste. The biscuit- no butter slaw average, mashed potatoes creamy.
My son & daughter had the Sweet Corn Raviolis. That was " to die for". The BEST most divine pasta we've had in Arizona, thus far! That is a MUST have here! Absolutely Incredible!!
My B-day boy had requested the Rainbow Trout, but they'd run out. "Bummer", as it was his "Birthday choice". He ended up getting the Roasted Salmon, it was good.
My husband had the BBQ Pub Burger with an egg & really seemed to enjoy it.

This review with 3 stars was hard. I'd say we will be back again and we ALL plan to get the Raviolis "for sure".. Hoping for an all around better experience next time!"}

It is a quasi-outdoor warehouse with casual seating areas (apart from the restaurant seating) and outdoor games.  Aside from that, not much to recommend it.  The service is awful - slow, inattentive, amateurish, and uninterested, the drinks were weak and just so-so, and the food was bland and did not live up to the restaurant's self proclaimed "gastropub" moniker.  But then I'm probably spoiled by the Twin Cities' more sophisticated, maturely developed, and creative restaurant scene, which Phoenix just can't touch."}

As an extra (free) compliment, they surprised us with some sweet candied grapes which worked well with our small charcuterie board. We didn't have any alcohol, but I felt a bit buzzed after completing our meal, probably from all the tyramine, haha!

We finally settled on a veggie wrap and I jokingly said that you should add this to the menu so that I remember it the next time.

We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  This was our first time there and I was amazed at how loud it was inside at 4:30 in the afternoon.  When our waitress finally arrived, I asked for lots of water.  It's damned hot out in the summer!  I explained to her that I would like LOTS of water.  
Fast forward to the food... it was average.  We had the pretzel bites for an appetizer. Not horrible, but not spectacular.  He ordered the fried chicken, and I had the fish and chips.  His complaint was the chicken was over cooked and too crispy for him.  I thought it was cooked fine, but really lacked flavor.  The fish though, that was pretty tasty.  It was a lot of food.  Too bad I spent most of my meal with an empty glass that should have had water in it.  LOTS of water.
I had to ask the hostess for a refill as well as the food runner.  My waitress was very visible on the floor, but could not seem to be bothered by checking in on such a lowly two-top.  Will we go back? Probably not.  This place did not rank on my list of "must have again". And thanks for the migraine due to dehydration... That makes the visit even better!"}

My husband and I had been wanting to try CD, so for Fathers Day we made time. We showed up, many tables open, and it's definitely a great atmosphere. Then the waitress shows up, we literally JUST sat down-super rad promptness, but maybe give guests a moment to look at the menu? Then I ordered a drink, after she returned, she asked to see my ID (I left my purse at home). So we found a copy of my Drivers License in our email from recently sending to a realtor. Mind you; I'm 39 years old, with an 18 year old daughter. She asked her manager and he said that he couldn't accept seeing the license and couldn't serve me a drink. I get rules, I do, but I'm obviously over 21.. So! We left. If I'm being honest, I wasn't that impressed with the menu anyways and the "anti pasta" menu is cool, but the pricing is a bit much AND I never mind paying for good food. 

Needless to say; we won't return. I'm bitter about the carding situation and I sincerely feel the customer service is lacking in experience. This is a disappointment, since we're new to the area and we live and work close to this location."}

Made reservations then get there and told wait would be about 15 minutes (I hate when that happens, why make reservations then) We decided we'd just sit outside so that we could be seated right away. We get seated and ordered our food when we order drinks. While waiting for our food, I saw three times where food was brought out to the wrong table and I'm thinking how is that happening. After 42 minutes, our food finally arrived (we only ordered the kids mac n cheese, fish and chips and the roasted salmon). My husband's salmon was not cooked completely. After flagging down 1 of our 2 servers, she told us "yeah, it's normally medium. Let me get that fixed" and took my husband's plate. The second server had come by the table a few times, only to chat with my 2.5 year old (yeah, odd). So after we sent the salmon back, she comes by again to talk to my son, never asking how things are or even noticing my husband didn't have his food. I interrupted her conversation with my little guy to let her know things were ok but my husband wasn't happy with his salmon. She goes "oh, well they normally only cook it medium rare". So I ask well why did the other lady say it's medium? This chick just smiled at me and then started back talking to my son. The chef ends up bringing the salmon back out and apologized and it was to my husband's liking. While we were eating, another guy comes over to us with someone else's order asking if it was ours....i just shook my head and laughed. The service was ok. The place nice and trendy, reminded me of some east coast places i loved. Probably should've sat inside, outside was sooo noisy (but, i wasn't ok waiting when I'd already made reservations) This place is probably somewhere I'd come with girlfriends for happy hour or to have drinks and appetizers before going out but not family dinner again. The first server seemed busy and the second server.....
This place is huge and I feel like with it being that big, the kitchen should be able to accommodate large crowds. There's no reason our food should have taken so long (and neither server came by with updates about the wait or to let us know it would be out soon) and I'm still trying to figure out why they kept taking food to wrong tables. We only came here because we wanted to check it out before the one in Gilbert opens."}

So we had some errands to run in The Domain, and passed this place along the way.  It didn't look like our scene, so we kept walking.  After the errands, we were strolling, looking for noms and decided to stop.  We are SO GLAD WE DID!  There were so many plates we wanted to try, we just started with apps and a meat/cheese board and went from there.  

The meat was outstanding.  I have a New Yorker on my hands, who swears he can't find good "deli" meat and this met his standards and then some.  The cheese was also delicious and delightful!  I also had to add the deviled eggs because...deviled eggs.  Those did not disappoint either.

We shared the Soft Pretzels with Fondue and Pierogies.  I kinda wished we hadn't gotten the pretzels, simply because those are on a lot of menus around town, but they were good nonetheless.  We make pierogies at home, and these were definitely up to par too.  Both sauces for each plate were amazing.  Do you get it yet that we liked this place?!

Finally, we topped everything off with the monkey bread.  Warm, gooey, sweet monkey bread.  Served with fresh vanilla ice cream (yes, you could see the bean specs in it)!  Hot apples on the bottom, don't GET ME STARTED!

The drinks were delicious too.  I had a mule and my boo had one of their specialty drinks - I'm pretty sure it had 3 types of rum in it, but it literally just tasted like iced tea.  Mmmmhmmmm!  

Finally - the service.  Our waiter was so accommodating, made awesome recommendations, and was SO attentive.  We were thoroughly impressed.

We cannot WAIT to go again and try more goodness!!"}

This time our sever was Manu who was amazing! My overall theme in the original review was the food wasn't necessarily the freshest. This time I got the prime rib dip sandwich with mushrooms and jalapeños. The sand which was one of the best prime rib dips I've ever had.  The dip was super flavorful without being too salty. The prime rib was tender and delicious. My girl got the sweet corn ravioli with prosciutto, which was recommended by our waiter Manu and that turned out to be amazingly tender and so flavorful. I can't stress enough how gracious and attentive the staff was and how good the food was this time. I've updated my rating to reflect my new experience which is more in line with the recommendations I've previously gotten. I would definitely recommend this in the future and I will be back for that sandwich. 

------------------------------------------------

The restaurant itself is very nice. The staff was great and our server Kael was awesome. That's the good. Now the bad. We ate there on the last night of restaraunt week and decided to do their special. My girl ordered the steak tacos and I got the fried chicken. On the menu the chicken says it takes longer but is worth the wait. I'm not sure why I didn't take a pic of the chicken. I just didn't think about it. It did not take longer than her tacos and when it came out it was extra greasy and lukewarm. Additionally there were spots in the chicken where it wasn't battered at all. When I tried it besides being lukewarm it wasn't seasoned very well. The steak tacos we ordered were decent but again did not taste fresh, like maybe they had not been cooked fresh or something. The corn tortillas were brittle and dry and like the chicken lukewarm. I've had a lot of people tell me the food is great here but that wasn't our experience this time. As it is I could not recommend this place. Very trendy, kinda pricey and food wasn't great."}

Must have had at least 7 different waitstaff working our table and each meal that arrived needed to be sorted out.  Wasn't as much of a challenge as you might expect because the meals came at 3 different intervals.  As for drinks that was worse.  The first round only took 15-20 minuts, a second round ordered by a few took the same and one of our party never did receive his.

The food was creative and tasty, will grant them that.

This place might get better the more you visit... which I plan to do again!

My husband and I arrived and were greeted by a friendly hostess who gave us a sitting promptly. They were busy but can accommodate customers inside and out.

The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. I didn't hear any servers apologizing to nearby tables for mistakes and people genuinely appeared to be enjoying their time.

We didn't make it up to the bar or outside. I would like to do so on the next visit though. I'm not sure if the outside games are first come first serve or reserve but we are interested in returning to find out.

Now for the food! I had the BEST honey fried chicken and delicious coleslaw. My husband ordered tacos and they were also scrumptious. We both liked our meals so much that we decided to share half and half. We went here more than a week ago and he's still recommending to others to go try the fried chicken. He says, "It was the best fried chicken I have ever had!"

We started our meal with hummus and ended it with a baked apple desert. Everything we had was delicious and every drink was yummy. Our server, Manu, was very attentive and made sure we had whatever we needed. He managed to keep all his tables happy. He really did his best to keep us happy but balanced it well with allowing us privacy.

This visit has us wanting to return for more! As long as they keep that chicken filled with honey, I will definitely return for more."}

We had a pre-fixed three course menu set out for us, and the food was delicious. We were served cheesy bread, avocado salad, fried chicken, sweet corn pasta, and apple pie with ice cream.

I presume the other regular menu offerings are also great and would love to come back here for some more bites and drinks! 

What's cool about this spot is that at the back there's a cool "barn-esque area called The Yard, with ping pong and some other games. It gets humid back there in the summer though, but it's a great time and will be even better in the winter!

I cannot be more excited to write this review because everything about the Culinary Dropout was a successful bliss. I love the concept of this place-big, open space, high ceiling, warehouse with cool lighting and hipster servers left and right providing excellent service. 

If the ambience wasn't cool enough, just sit down and order something on the menu. My coworker got the meatloaf and he was swimming in it. I ordered the Steak and Potatoes and was drowning in it. Definitely going back with my hubby to try all of their yummy cocktails and other dishes for sure. Probably this weekend! lol

This place would be a great place to rent for company events or even weddings and parties! If the chef was a culinary dropout, thank goodness he dropped out to create The Culinary Dropout."}

I didn't actually like the Korean cap that much ‍ just not my fav flavors and it was pretty price. That's the only thing we wouldn't ever order again."}

Since the Cosmos aligned, thought we would try a place that doesn't have a slide or play place attached to it..
Culinary Dropout sort of hard to find yet well worth the hunt!  
After walking down a long, cement hallway, it opens up to an airy, hipster yet welcoming main area. 
We were quickly seated and quickly attended to. 
The food consisted of a variety of burgers etc with some culinary twists. We shared the roast beef dip and also had the pretzel bites to go.
Fantastic meal and the bites w/the cheese sauce are dangerously good.
Good craft beer selection of local favorites along with some non-local goodies. 
The server did give me the wrong beer yet I did not complain...it's beer!
All in all, great place to dine and if the Cosmos aligns again (or we get a sitter), we will head to Culinary Dropout!!"}

If you would like to have a wonderful hamburger sandwich or steak or a nice antipasti or even just had a cold beer this is the place for just about everyone the food is of an exceptional quality the wait staff were actually really super nice and there is a good selection of music

My aunt and uncle are h-u-g-e advocates of any Fox restaurant  and have been to the Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale. They were surprised at the decor and lack of an employee dress code compared to the Scottsdale location. I loved the hipster-y vibe and outdoor games! Perhaps no employee dress code because they've recently opened? We weren't sure. Some of the outfits we saw servers wearing we'd hardly call appropriate for a nice restaurant like Culinary Dropout. 
My family had reservations, so there was no wait once I arrived. We were seated in the main area with cool wooden tables. The metal chairs were cool but not comfy - my cousin and I were sad we didn't get the comfy-looking floral-patterned chairs. 
Service could have been better - our girl was hit or miss with us - I saw her pay more attention to her other tables. It kind of was one of those nights where we saw her when we needed to order drinks/food, and then once they were delivered. 
The food was amazing! Pretzel roll balls and the cheese sauce were great, ordered per my aunt and uncle. Everyone enjoyed their food, but the portion sizing seemed a bit off, comparing pricing/portion for my Ramen bowl to my mom's entree. 
Overall cool place but some kinks should be worked out."}

Poor TV layout - more needed everywhere esp in The Coop
Servers at bar are slow/self absorbed.

Busy even on a Wednesday evening. The staff was incredibly friendly. 

The fried chicken was probably the best or next to the best I've ever had, all time. It was amazing. Everyone else I was with loved their food. I also thought the grilled cheese sliders were great. They didn't try to over-fancify them. Just good, traditional grilled cheese. 

It is a bit overpriced for what it is, but oh well. The menu didn't note that it was grass-fed or organic or anything, so I am not sure what kind of chicken it is to be so pricey. 

It is a great atmosphere and delicious. I will definitely go back. Maybe next time 5 stars. I think they are still getting ramped up - I asked for a box and they threw away my food. They did make a completely full new meal for me and the waiter was super nice about it. The valet also took a pretty long time."}

I have been to the Scottsdale location and had delicious food and good service. My time spent at the Temp location did not live up to this. First, we asked the host to be sat near a heater outside, and he took us to the farthest coldest table that was very dark. We then decided to sit in the open seating next to the bar. We sat down and waited 20 minutes without anyone coming to serve us. I went to the bar to ask for a server and it took another 15 minutes to get water. By this time we had been there for 45 minutes. We finally ordered drinks which were not the drinks we ordered. Had asked for draft beers and got bottled. We ordered food, both of my friends food was good but my tomato soup was cold. It was also my friends birthday and they brought out his cake when he wasn't there and it was very uncomfortable and awkward. I feel so bad that we got such bad service on his birthday, I am so sad this location did not live up to my expectations because the staff was so inattentive, I really felt like I was bothering the restaurant staff by being there."}

The first part reminds me of a swanky apartment. There are plenty of tables and would be my pick if you were going out for dinner to enjoy the "gastro" part of this gastropub.
 
The second section is The Yard - a covered patio with plenty of patio couches, fire pits and backyard games. This is where I spent all my time so I'll tell you a bit more about it below!**

I believe the third part is called The Shed, or the Garage or something like that. It's a smaller, very rustic, barn-like building at the far end of The Yard and looks like it could be a whiskey bar or something to that extent. It was closed at the time so I didn't get a chance to check it out.

**I over heard a guy and a girl talking about how much they like corn hole.
I looked at them like a cow looks at an oncoming train. You could hear my eyelids blinking in confusion through the silence until another, more savvy Canadian at our table filled in the gaps for me...

"It's that bean bag game, Dale." Suddenly it all makes sense!

The Yard is awesome. It's like a gentrified version of cousin Cletus' famous family BBQ - Fried chicken, pretzels, fire pits and games galore, including (you guessed it) Corn Hole! Maybe I'm taking this a little far. The Yard is by no means redneck. It's relaxed and quite lovely - you could hang out here after work, bring the the kids, go on a date, or yell belligerently about your college football team late at night. I have no doubt that this place must draw quite the party crowd on weekend nights, but you don't need to be that crowd in order to have a good time here.

The food is and upscale version of American comfort classics. Even though I was pretty fooded-out by the time I arrived, I still suckered myself into the fried chicken and I regret nothing. So dang delicious and served with a sweet sauce and a slice of corn bread."}

Food: 3.5, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 5
Cost to worth it rating: 3.5 (brunch items and cocktails ~$10-12)
Opentableable: yes, kid's menu: yes
Return worthiness: yes

Highlights:
- Atmosphere: big and open, fun and welcoming. There's an area out back that is covered but feels like it's outside and games behind it (corn hole, ping pong, shuffleboard). Lots of TVs for game day
- Cocktails: unique offerings. For bubbly they had more than mimosas. I had one that had fig vodka and elderflowers and another with gun and strawberry.
- French dip: my hub really liked it. 4 stars
- Breakfast sandwich: as big as a burger with egg, bacon, and avocado on a bun. 4 stars
- Breakfast potatoes: little uneven squares of potato goodness cooked just right so they are tender inside and crispy outside. Bonus for the large sprinkles of salt to top it all off. 5 stars 
- Grilled cheese sliders: cute pair of squares of the sandwich. 
- Milk for kids: huge pint sized one in a plastic cup with a lid. Usually my lil guy guzzles down the tiny cup they give him and needs a refill.

Midlights:
- Breakfast burrito: not bad but bit boring with an omelette like egg and couldn't taste the chile apparently in it. 3 stars 
- No coloring menu for kids: don't expect this everywhere but would be fitting here since I saw a bunch of kids there.

Lowlights:
- Didn't have room to try the desserts which sounded yummy.

Enjoyed our brunch here and would come back for another meal."}

My go-to is the garden kale salad with chicken. I seriously don't know what it is about this salad, but it always tastes so fresh and it literally never gets old! I'm also a big fan of their sangria here. I think it might be the same sangria they serve at all Fox Restaurants, so I pretty much always get it! Not to mention the fact that the staff here is always so friendly and awesome in every way!

If you've never been, the pretzels and cheese fondue dip are a definite must order! Looking for an appetizer on the lighter side? The hummus + pita is really great too! As I'm writing this review, I can't help but to reminisce on all the times I've been in to Culinary recently. Whether it be drinks after work with a friend, a corporate work party, or simply a casual Monday night - Culinary is great on all occasions, which is what I love most about it. Dress it up or dress it down, there's no right or wrong here. This aspect shines through in what you order as well. A few of my other favorites: their Thai Chile chicken wings (which is not something I would usually go for) as well as their sweet corn ravioli! Order some appetizers or split a couple dishes among friends! My biggest advice is to explore the menu and branch out! Enjoy!"}

The food was okay. Really overpriced beer food. I wouldn't come here just to eat. The drinks were tasty but they weren't strong enough and pretty overpriced. 

Overall, you're paying for the atmosphere which was not what I wanted. Not sure if I will be back soon. Very gorgeous location and a funky atmosphere. Not for me though since the prices are a bit steep."}

It's quite pricey for what it is, probably going to run you about $20-25 for a lunch and drink and we went for happy hour and it was about $85, nothing happy about that. HOWEVER, it has a great ambiance to it (industrial decor) and it's definitely a younger crowd - college age. They have cornhole and some other games in the yard. It is an outside eatery so it will be too hot to be there during summer months. I'd highly recommend the pretzel and cheese appetizer, delish! Other than that, not worth the money. It is very much a bar so do everyone a favor and don't bring your kids....that is, if they're even allowed."}

I'd like to give more stars, but because I stood at the Host station for several minutes before anyone acknowledged my existence made me rate this establishment lower. Although the food increased the rating to the 3 Star because of the superb taste, I was left feeling hungry (I'm a size 2) after due to the small portions. 

This placed was packed on a Tuesday night so the wait was 30-45 minutes, but I was able to quickly find seating for 1 at the bar. There were about 5 guys working the massive bar, so no one acknowledged me for several minutes as well. Once I was greeted by a curly hair bearded gentleman he was nice and pleasant. I really wanted to try the Chicken because of all of the high reviews and it seemed hearty for my empty stomach but elected to try the Roasted Salmon instead. 

The Roasted Salmon came quick and right away I noticed the the proportions were really small for a $22 plate. Nonetheless, I'm aware that Salmon is costly. It was good in taste and satisfying. 

I'd like to give this place another try to improve in service and for the Chicken. A few others near my seat ordered the Chicken; it smelled and looked great plated and I felt that would've fill my stomach. 

I'm leaving to go spend money at a nearby eatery because again, I was left with a semi-full stomach.

UPDATE: I had to come back to my review and update all of the Yelp'ers with my Wow experience from Culinary Dropout. 

About 2 mins after leaving my initial review, I was politely approached by the GM. I had NO idea that this person was a General Manager as she was the one that helped me after I waited to be acknowledged by the hostess post. Anyway, she immediately apologized for the service I received (I'm still in shock that she even knew who I was, I do not have a picture of myself on my Yelp profile). She also mentioned my review and said she'd like an opportunity to make it right and didn't want me to leave without having an opportunity to make things right with me. She offered the Chicken entree AND another glass of Moscato since I spoke about wanting to try it, at first I declined but after a slight push from her I obliged to the offer. 

Not only did I receive the Chicken entree, but another young lady followed up and mentioned how I'm a valued customer and that they really appreciated me giving them the opportunity to make things right for me. Whoa!! I was MORE than taken care of. 

I travel a lot for work and this is my 4th time in Tempe in the last 6 months. From Orlando, Virginia, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Philadelphia and Texas to name a few places in the last few months I've never had this type of service!!! I do Trip Advisor reviews, Google reviews, Yelp and even BBB Reviews if it gets really serious and in my business as a Facilitator Consultant in Human Capital Management teaching about Branding is vital to the success on a business and personal level! They have truly branded their service in a newfound way for me. 

I will tell everyone and anyone about my experience and incorporate this scenario into my classes when training. I feel valued. I feel special and I feel like I'm more than a customer. All three people I interacted with tonight truly made my day! Shout out to Deven (my bartender)  who told me to "Pay my Experience" forward and I will do just that! Thanks Culinary Dropout! I won't forget how you made me feel.  

BTW: the Chicken was EVERYTHING! It was so good! I really enjoyed both plates - they were equally delicious!"}

Atmospherically speaking, it is dark.  The windows are blacked out with drapes, the ground is dark, the furnishing is dark, and with a tinge of yellow lighting throughout the place, you truly feel like you're in a medevil pub. 

The menu is filled with a decent variety of classic, vegetarian, and modern/fusion pasties.  As a newcomer from out of town, it was quite hard for me to decide which pasty to get.  Although I really wanted to try one of the 2 portobello mushroom varieties, I ended up getting a classic, the cottage pie.  To fulfill my fungi craving, I paired it with a very garlicky, and very flavorful mushroom spinach soup.

The cottage pie was decent, but after the blast of flavor concentrated soup, my mouth was just not amazed by their spot on authentication, of the bland British classic.  If you want the classic, you'll probably love the nostalgia of the pie.

If you want flavor and the experience you get from lots of aromatic compounds, the Cajun chicken and Mexican pasty smelled wonderful.  

I for one will be coming back for the balsamic portobello pasty next, which probably means tomorrow night since my trip here shall end the following day.  And I shall keep coming back with every subsequent Phx trip till I've satisfied my tastebud's curiosity.  I guess I'm a bit OCD when it comes to joints with a rainbow of the same type of dish."}

The restaurant is cool looking - lots of trestle tables where you can sit with a big group of friends, or join some not-yet-friends who are already there.  Indoor/outdoor bar (wrong time of year for the outdoor part, but good to bear in mind for when the weather gets back to perfect)."}

Did not know that they made the Tempe location dark on purpose to mimic a mine--thought it was to go along with the emo/Goth/lots of tattoos and face piercings crowd that appears to be in attendance--which is great if you're into that sort of thing (we're not).  The Mesa/Chandler location is a bit more open, lighted, and civilized (in terms of face piercings).

It's got it all. The pasties are what got me though. The inside is pretty dark but cozy. Not a place you'd have a meeting. They do have outdoor seating though. 
Happy Hour: $1 off drafts

Service: The bartender greets you when you sit down and checks in on you at the right time. He's good at knowing when to stop by.

Food: I've been here multiple times, but my favorite has to be the Lovely Bit of Salmon that I recently ordered. I think the dill sauce and salmon combo makes this pasty special. They don't skimp on the salmon. Lately, I've been looking for options somewhat on the healthier side and I would recommend this. You get your omega 3 and a flavorful meal.
The Oggie - plenty of meat for the meat lover, very delicious, recommend to dip in the red wine gravy sauce that comes out with the meal

If you live in Phoenix, you should try this place at least once. But that'll be enough because you'll be back for more!"}

I remember the first time we went after hearing about it here on Yelp, we ended up leaving with the 'ole "where have you been my whole life" feeling. This place is awesome. 
    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. 
The food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. 
    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks. You having nothing to lose."}

Our server was Sarah who was absolutely wonderful. She was really on the ball, a great server, and anticipated our needs in advance. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, my friend got the Porky pasty. Our food came in a rather timely fashion despite it being a very busy Friday dinner rush. I enjoyed the salad, the portion was huge. The chicken was tasty and there was plenty of tomatoes, cukes and dressing (on the side). My friend really enjoyed the Porky and even took some home, as it was quite a lot. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of this place when we first walked in. The darkness really didn't convey fun and friendly but the service was great and so was the food so it more than made up for the initial shock I felt upon arriving.

We found the Cornish Pasty Company on Yelp and glad to see they were nearby (and had all day Happy Hour on Sundays!)

The interior was surprising dark, but the outdoor patio was inviting - especially as we were heading back to the chilly midwest the next day. We grabbed a table on the patio and were greeted by our server shortly after.  We opted for a couple of beers as we reviewed the menu - lots of great options and hard to make a decision.

I went with the Greek Chicken Pasty and my husband decided on the Guiness Stew Pasty and a side of baked chips to share. The food was great, but unfortunately, the entire experience was overshadowed by the fact that staff refuses to enforce the "No Smoking on the Patio" rule. There was a patron at the table next to us smoking despite sitting right in front of a sign - staff obviously didn't care as nothing was said. I finally let one of the servers passing by know that someone was smoking and the response was pretty nonchalant; however, they did ask that person to step outside the patio. The group sharing our table was very appreciate especially considering there were several small children nearby.

Not even five minutes later, someone else was openly smoking right next to the patio door leading to the interior - multiple servers walked by and did nothing.

This probably would have been a four-star experience without the smoking!"}

The food is generally really good and this review is mostly in regards to to-go orders. This is the 2nd time I've ordered the food to go during my lunch and my order has been completely wrong when I get it back to work. 

Today I ordered a chicken ceasar salad. I was asked if I wanted it "mixed" together and I said, sure. So I get my order, get it back to my office and it's a salad in one box, dressing on the side...and a full, un-sliced chicken breast in another box. Okaaay....maybe "mixed" didn't mean what I thought it meant..oh well. So I pour the dressing on the salad and it's ranch, not ceasar. Not a huge deal..just not what I ordered. So then I go to cut up the chicken breast and it is definitely slathered in spaghetti sauce. So now I have a ranch salad and a spaghetti sauce covered chicken breast. Awkward.

Because my lunch hour was almost over and I was starving, I decided, fine..I'll just eat them separately and call it a meal. Both were awful. The chicken tasted like it had been reheated and the salad was wilted. This is a bummer because their food is good every time I eat there so it may just be a takeout issue. So for that reason, I recommend eating there - no takeout!"}

I never knew that this place was a Must-Do until looking it up afterwards! The only thing the guys in my volleyball group said we were "going to a place nearby [to Mitchell Park] for beer and food". I love beer. And I love food after a few hours of sand volleyball. Score points for them getting me to Cornish Pasty Co!

We walk in and I'm definitely taken back to some hipster dives and British pubs I've been to in my time. While it was a little too dark for my liking, I get the hipster feel they're going for since that's the majority of people I've seen there. The service has been wonderful - cheerful gals who consistently ask if they can help in any way and know their stuff. 

The beer list is small, and I like it! Within two weeks of my two visits, the beer menu had changed. There were a few breweries that hadn't changed, but the styles had. ALL THAT is what I call quality. Even better, the two servers were knowledgeable about the entire beer menu each time. They must do extreme taste-testing before the beer menu goes out [which I'd be totally jealous of!]. The food is even better - my fellow volleyballers love the soups, and we all agree on the pasty's. I love love the Bangers & Mash Pasty, and the Oggie looks delicious too. You just can't go wrong with them... unless they are sold out for the day. My next goal is to try their desserts which sound very appealing!"}

The oven chips and other potato option was also amazing! Great outdoor area with giant tables. Lovely beer list. Friendly service. Can't wait to go back!"}

I knew it was Not pronounced Paste-eee, (like what strippers wear over their nipples) but I said it that way anyway. Then one day someone eaves dropped on our convo, and corrected me. So now I say it right most of the time..

Anyway, this place is great.  Its cheap and its good.  The last time I came I had the Oggie.  Its one of their traditional pasties.  It has steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy.   I am always attempting different pasties everytime I come. And every single one has been great so far.  Hubby had the Cajun Chicken and that was good.

Their pasties run from $8-9.50.  You get a nice portion size and if you really feel like sharing you can do with one.  But I recommend getting your own and doing a nice switch with one half of your pasty.  Much more fun that way and worth the calories!

It has expanded since the last time I was there.  So if you walk in and see that cramped area where they do all the cooking; keep walking and you will see that it opens up to a nice spacious area.  We learned the hard way.  After sitting for awhile, we were watching the cooks take out pasty after pasty.  We kept looking around, wondering what the hell?!  We thought we were the only ones.  But I finally decided to see what was up, lo and behold!  A whole new section.

Overall a wonderful place"}

The Pasty may not look like much but that is because all the effort is spent preparing the delicious pockets of heaven. You can sit at the bar and watch them make the pasties right in front of you using all fresh ingredients. A few of my favorites are the bangers and mash served with red wine gravy and the carne adovada served with salsa and sour cream. They have just as many vegetarian options and use the brand Quorn which is great, I have had quite a few of their veggie patsies and they are all delicious.
This place is small so not recommended for big groups and if you go during lunch expect a wait - and trust me the wait is worth it!"}

First, I am reviewing a Delivery order that I placed.  (If you didn't know that they delivered... Now you do!)

You start by looking at their website, which is modest.  It's a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol.

*TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasn't even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food.

At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way.

Cornish Pasty's (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version.

Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS.

Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!"}

My friends have been telling me about this place for months and I haven't had the opportunity to try it. Yesterday I finally did and my tummy has never been happier.

I love the ambiance of the place. It's very small, though they are working on an extension. The employees are all tattooed and rugged, which made me feel right at home. Motorhead, System of the Down, and other older rock and roll and metal music pumped through the speakers, making my ears nearly as happy as my stomach.

They have an extensive beer collection with different options from all over the world.

I had the portobello chicken pasty, and it was wonderful. The insides were so delicious and the crust was decadent. It was a lot of food, but I was determined to finish it.

I've heard this place gets super busy at peak hours and I'm not surprised. I am already looking forward to going back and trying another one of their delicious concoctions.

You can also buy their pasties uncooked so you can make them at home!"}

My boyfriend and I walked in and went to the patio. It wasn't overwhelmingly busy, and we sat down at a table. It took 20 minutes to even grab the attention of a server to order drinks. Our server came back with the wrong beers (really?) and then a different server greeted us (45 min. after sitting down) and we told her we were being helped by someone else. So the original server comes back with our beers and takes our food order - by the way, they do not have anything gluten free here, despite what other reviews say. The server said they don't ever have gluten free dough or anything. So that was a huge bummer, because my boyfriend literally couldn't get anything on the menu other than a salad. We finally got our food and it was fantastic (I got the chicken pot pie pasty).

A pasty is a sort of like a gourmet hot pocket, that actually tastes really good, and was invented in England.

The Cornish Pasty Company has dozens of tasty options, with my favorites being "The Porky", "Bangers and Mash", and "Chicken Pot Pie". 

The Porky consists of pork, potatoes, apples, onion, and sage, with a side of red wine gravy.

The Bangers and Mash pasty consists of pork and sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, and comes with a side of gravy. 

The Chicken Pot Pie Pasty has chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery, with a thyme and chicken gravy.

They also have one of the best and most unique beer menus available with an awesome mix of domestic micro brews and great European options.

They also have a pretty good happy hour every day, even on weekends.

I was feeling quite sick and couldn't decide what would satisfy my soul when my roommate suggested we get some soup. Little did I know what a cool scene I was walking into or I would have probably changed out of my pajamas. In reality, NO ONE CARED about my attire, the lighting was dark and the seating was said to be from an old mine however it reminded me more of a church.  The people that work here are super chill, they were playing AC/DC's, "Let there be Rock" and the pasty's reminded me of an Australian pie. 

The soup was fabulous and they give you tons of bread which is delicious to dip or butter! They've got pasties on pasties on pasties to pick from as well. I decided on the vegan eggplant parmesan and although I was under the impression I specifically asked for no cheese, vegan or not, I received it. Hey, mistakes happen it was what it was and I wouldn't order that again but even if I wasn't going to eat, its a low key hipster bar scene for sure, and i'm all about that."}

Go for the vegetarian "chicken" tikka masala pasty with yogurt dipping sauce all the way!!

The food is last-meal-on-earth worthy.

I cannot, however, give Cornish Pasty Co. five stars, because the service is sooo hit or miss. I will deal with slow service for the food, but good gravy I wish they'd get a clue on this point. Sometimes I go there and it's wonderful--I get my booze, food and check in a time frame reasonable for human living. Other times, I convince people I know to try the place out and we're literally there for two and a half hours while the one server working at the time roams the entire place and spends half the time chatting. 

I read a lot of yelp reviews of places I love and think people are being entitled jerks about the service and they should never leave corporate franchise places. I would never, never complain about service if it was even mediocre. Just, from time to time, the service here is so bad I do question whether I should ever go back."}

At some point I'd like to try a dessert pasty, but that might have to be a special trip. 

The only small negative to this place is that the service can sometimes be slow. Also, note that it's pretty dark inside, so if you're with people who like a lot of light to read the menu this is not the place.

I would have never considered this place (because of its location and I had never heard about it before) if it weren't for my fiance who had read a review and decided that we should give it a try.  To my amazement, this place is actually very cool!  I can't think of another place like it anywhere.  I have tried about 4 or 5 of their pasties and they have all been excellent.  I can only describe them as "calzones filled with awesomeness".  There has to be at least 15 different ones to choose from and they are all probably very tasty.  I cannot vouch for how healthy the things are, but they are very good.  At about 7ish dollars for a pasty they are a good value because they fill you up quite nicely.

With my meal, I usually get a salad (their dressing is amazing), the mashed peas and the roasted potatoes.  Sometimes I can't help but have one (or more) of their $3 Irish car bombs.  The salad, peas and potatoes are enough to share with 2-3 people, but keep the car bombs for yourself!

My only complaint about this place is the seating.  If you have a party of 3 or more you just shouldn't go there.  Not only is the place tiny, the tables are only for 2 people.  I think they only have 1 or 2 tables that can accommodate more.  There is a bar area and that is where I dine because the tables are usually filled.

Our new thing is to pre-order a few pasties.  They have them ready in just a few minutes, you pick them up, then pop them in your own oven.  This way we don't have to worry about seating.  

Also, the service there is always friendly and fast, but always a bit frenzied because the place is always so busy."}

I have no idea why it needs to be so dark but it is hard to enjoy your meal.  I am all about a dive or a little hole in the wall but the decor and tables in this place are just too much to get over.  I mentioned to a friend that they must keep the lights out so you don't notice how bad everything is.  The waitress we had was just horrible.  She took forever to come by and when she did she was put off by our questions. She was able to offer a few recommendations as this was my fiends first time there.  When it comes to the food I loved it both times.  The three stars is based on the quality and taste of the food. Maybe next time we come by we will sit on the patio"}

its worth a try!  they enlarged the place and have a ton more seating, so that was helpful!"}

Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  

The main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1

The second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  

The crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. 

Give it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy."}

I first went to this restaurant in 2014 and there's no stopping since then. The place is very hipster, dark and packed. It definitely seems like a Sherlock holmes, batman night out. 

There are days when I crave for their Mushroom soup. Its one of the best soup i have had. They have creamy, walnut filled mushroom soup, served with house made bread and heaps of butter. You will never get tired of their bread. Cream of tomato with croutons is good too. We generally order Tandoori wings for our appetizer, which is cooked to perfection, not spicy and served with celery and ranch. When it comes to pasty, they are the boss. Their Lamb vidaloo, Chicken tikka masala brings out the complete flavor in a pasty form. The filling is delicious and their pasty, so soft made of complete butter just melts in the mouth, baked till crisp golden from the outside . One can eat just the plain pasty and crave for more. Spicy Asiago chicken and chicken pot pie are our next options. Please save room for desert, each ones unique but Apple caramel pasty you will not be disappointed.

They have a wide range of options and this place is definitely heaven for vegans too. The service is really good and you will find a lot of young hip crowd. The price is definitely reasonable and a great place to hangout with groups. I will keep visiting this place."}

They don't overload with fats or cheeses so the meal remains balanced and tasty.  Happy hour M-Sat until 6 just adds another reason to stop by."}

The food is absolutely killer here; I've tried four of the pasty's (pronounced liked nasty with a "p" not like tasty with a "p"-well at least that's what I've gathered from listening to the staff) and they've all been amazing. The best part is it isn't only the traditional meat cheese and potatoes. The options are all over the place and you can even bring your vegan friends. You can get a beer from the other side of the pond and the ambiance definitely feels like a good pub from across the Atlantic. 
The only reason they aren't getting five stars is because my most recent visit; the bartender eating his dinner at the bar was clearly more important than my dinner. It's ok; it's not like with a hot meal I'd like to chase it down with a beverage of sort. The kitchen guys have always been extremely helpful and I appreciate them. The food is amazing enough and diverse enough to where I'll be back frequently, just hopefully not during my bartender's dinner time."}

The seating was limited and tiny but we sat at the bar. There's PLENTY of setting outside but it was a little chilly. The dishes coming out of this TINY kitchen in the back is crazy good!!"}

I've never had a bad meal at any of their locations. My boyfriend and I love the pilgrim, the Italian, and the chicken pot pie pasty, but we're excited to try some of the others! I've never been to their happy hour, but drink prices are already pretty low and their deals on HH look amazing too. Even better, they serve 32 oz beers on draft!! The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the service is often slow, especially at Scottsdale location."}

Great bar and lots nice salads and apps. Try the oven chips.

I'm so glad a local friend recommended we check this spot out when I was visiting from Philly. The parameters I gave said friend were "I want good food in a lowkey dark bar that won't care if I'm in today's sweaty hiking gear." That's what I got, and then some. The place was described as divey but I'd say that none of the negative connotations of that term apply, and only the positive ones. We sat at the bar and enjoyed scotch egg, wings, and two pasties. The chicken parm and the chicken tikka masala were so good I ate until I was in pain..

My husband tried the Salmon with all the rave reviews on yelp, and it was so tasty!  The salad was fresh-loved the olives and cherry tomatoes.

Joking, obviously. 

I was here to celebrate a friend's birthday. They told us 20 people would fit at one of the long tables. Uh, no. Not unless we all sat shoulder-to-shoulder with our arms squeezed under the table. Oh well, all 20 people weren't there at the same time, and a few people stood, so the 14ish people that were sitting, were comfortable. But, being a looooooong bench at a table, it was kind of a pain when the person in the middle wanted to get out of their seat.

The pasty I had (some southwesternish thing, I think) was okay. I've never had a pasty before and if I ever return (which I have no objection to), I will order something different. The drink menu listed cider on tap. They didn't have any. I don't know if it was just that night, or permanently, but I was sad. Our server was great, though. For a busy night, he was pretty attentive."}

I don't eat around Tempe too often and when I do I'd like that experience to be unique.  I was looking for a place to grab some good food and a couple beers before a concert so I checked out Yelp and it did not lead me astray.

To me, a place like this is why Yelp needs to exist.  It was not in the most obvious location and when the group I was with went to walk in the front door we almost didn't know we were in the right place.  Let's just say their limited space is used very efficiently.  For what this place lacks in size, it makes up in character.

Inside it was kind of dark with some chairs lining the bar long the open kitchen and on the other wall a few small tables.  We found our spot in the back which was probably the only table big enough for 6 people.  The place was full and the noise level was just right; busy, but comfortable to have some lively dinner conversation. (Especially after some Irish Car Bombs.)

Their draft beer selection stuck to the UK theme with a lot of beers from that region.  I was especially surprised to see some Strongbow Cider.  They also had a few good micro brews from places like Firestone and Rogue.  Between that selection and the 32 oz. monster glasses they'd serve it in, this place was already a winner.

Most importantly, their food was excellent.  I had the TIki Masala pasty and my wife had the Chicken Greek.  The Tiki Masala would be a great dish served by itself in an Indian restaurant.  Put it in a pasty and it's game over.  I tasted my wife's Chicken Greek which I probably wouldn't have picked as one of my own top choices to order and it was awesome.

We unanimously agreed this place was great and we had a laugh about some review around here that compared it to a Hot Pocket.  LOL.  I'll have to save that one under, "Knowing about good food - FAIL!""}

Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.

While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!

The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was "effing delicious" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. 

Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the "Pilgrim" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.

Definitely put this on your "must see" list of places to eat (for lunch)!"}

Next, go ahead and get yourself a cup of one of their awesome soups. Personal favorite: Red Pepper. Spicy, fresh, and delicious. If soup isn't your thing, I would recommend the oven chips -- oven-cooked french fries with cracked pepper. Definitely add the jalapeno. 

For the main course, obviously a pasty is the way to go. My favorites include The Mexican (spiced steak strips, eggs, potatoes, jalapenos), The Royale with Cheese (hamburger, french fries, grilled onions, bacon, cheddar/swiss blend), and the Chicken Pot Pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery). 

Finish your meal off with a class Cornish Pasty desert: The Banoffee Pie. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel with bananas, and whipped cream... If you're not melting already you should get to a past shoppe ASAP. 

5/5 for incredible atmosphere, food, staff, and overall experience. HIGHLY recommend."}

But they do serve food and we weren't ordering Baby C car bombs or anything and he was behaved - so those people can go "Sit On It"!

J ordered a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup and an order oven chips with garlic.  
My Pasty - The Mexican
J's Pasty - Bangers and Mash

The soup was awesome - he shared a few spoonfuls with me and Baby C.  Baby C went crazy for it!  

My Pasty - Very tasty.  The right amount of spice.  Not oily.  Very filling!  I could only eat 1/2 of my pasty.  

J didn't like his pasty all that much.  He said it was extremely salty and heavy.  Wished he would have ordered something else instead of trying to go somewhat authentic.  

The oven chips were kind of a disappointment.  I wouldn't order them again due to a good portion of them being still on the raw side.    

So it was kind of a hit or miss depending on what you ordered.  Might be able to talk J into going back again and have him try a different pasty."}

As I said the guys doing the cooking and prep were more than willing to talk to us telling us about the different dishes even though they were very busy.
 
I ordered the 'bangers and mash' while my wife had the salmon both were very very good and for dessert we had the chocolate baked bread {that might not be the exact name but its close} good god it was soo damn good! Next time I'm getting one to take home.

- The atmosphere is great (outdoor patio for when its nice outside and a dark cozy inside when you are out in a date).

With that I went with the meatball pastie, that included fresh sliced meatballs, basil, fresh marinara and mozzarella. This pastie is one of many that they offer depending on your cravings.

My friend ordered the Lovely Bit a Salmon [$11], which had some kind weird herb to it and made it taste unpleasant. I don't think the accompanying sauce helped much. The pasty is also very filling. I ate half and I was pretty much set.

The interior is dark as all hell. I walked in and I nearly bumped into someone. It's probably the darkest restaurant I've ever seen. Each table gets this tiny light that comes down from the ceiling. I can't imagine eating inside.

So we ate outside on the awkwardly too big wooden tables and sat on the immobile seats that are placed too far from the table.

The waiter was very chill. Too chill? Like skater boy chill. 

I read that the other locations are better, so I would probably eat at one of those places rather than the tempe location."}

It's in an odd location at a strip-mall that's tucked around the corner from a decent Mexican restaurant and a sub-shop.  

I'm not sure if they're going for the feel of a mineshaft, but it was ridiculously cold in there.  I'm all for beating the heat, but to go from 104 to 62 degrees was a little much for me.  

I could talk more about the ambiance, which is mildly interesting, but the food is the most important thing.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red curry) which had chicken, potato, and the red curry sauce.  The chicken was dry, as well as the curry sauce.  Mere days before I'd had Chicken red curry at George and Dragon in Phoenix, which was really good.  The pasty was not on par with that.  I have to say it was one of the more bland curries I've ever had.  Perhaps I should have tried something like their Bangers and Mash or Shepherd's Pie.

As for the price, everything on the menu should cost about 20% less.  I think Cornish Pasty is WAY overpriced.  Some of the more traditional stuff is $7 to $7.50, while everything else is $8-9.  Beer is also a little on the pricey side (20 ounce drafts are $5-6) for this kind of place.  Two Boddington's and a pasty were $18 before tax and tip.  So if you absolutely have to have a pasty then I guess this is your place, otherwise there are some other fabulous places nearby that won't break the bank."}

They have a nice collection on tap and even more beers, I believe, in the bottle. I like that you can watch the food prep opera at the bar as they are continually putting together new pasties to keep up the supplies or, one of my new favorites, when the weather is nice, sit at the outside patio to enjoy the cool weather and the piped out music, which is audible but not overpowering.

My favorite pasties, which are a welsh savory pastry, are:

The Peppered Steak
The Greek (vegetarian)

I'm also a big fan of their incredibly fresh house salads with pesto dressing - a regular is good enough for two people or half works for a single serving. I understand there are now locations in Mesa and Old Town Scottsdale but this was the original location and dare I say it, still my favorite. Worth checking out if you are looking for a place with good food and good beer, and people watching is always fun due to the location close to the University, it has a significant bohemian vibe and though I'm not a hipster (too old and too fat), it is fun to mingle with the more visible members of the creative class that Richard Florida writes about."}

Maybe it's the Mesa place?  The Tempe location is tucked in the corner of a dingy mall far out of the Mill Ave nightlife.  There is barely a sign on the building, the windows are painted dark black with an old photo mural theme, the door leads into a narrow black corridor with no greeter.  It looks like a bar with a few 2-person tables and that's all ... until you accidentally discover that the bar (with barstools) is actually a "kitchen" with no alcohol and that if you wend your way around the end of the bar, passing the restrooms, you will find the actual dining room and drinking bar.  We ate in the kitchen/bar and only later happened upon that discovery and that there is second equally dark and foreboding door that goes to the main dining room.

The employees seemed to all guys, with a distinct aura of all being bikers, but they were super-friendly and acceptably attentive.  Assuming the food is made from scratch, the 20 - 30 minute wait to be served was also acceptable.  You can pass the time enjoying an excellent selection of draft and bottled beers.

At $6.50, my Oggie pasty was a good value.  The crust was tender and flakey and the meat was tasty.  I learned from this my first experience with rutabaga that I am not a fan of rutabaga, but that's not their fault. The amount of filling was roughly what you get in one of those tiny 99 cent pot pies in the frozen food section of the supermarket.  The brown-wine gravy was yummy.

The place sends a confusing message. It absolutely looks like a college dive (and I probably would be there all the time if I attended ASU) but it's quite a hike from campus. It's not Scottsdale funky (yea!!), and if you are wearing anything fancier than a tee shirt and jeans you would definitely feel out of place.  It's a curiously quiet place, none of the ribaldry you would find at an Irish pub (the canned music was mostly soft rock of the 70's and 80's).

Bottom line - it's rare to find a good pasty in this area, and these are good.  As the rating states, it's A-OK."}

Especially for a New Yorker, with no dining spot like this back home (but see below). Luckily, it's near the Airport, so it makes a great place to have your first and/or last meal on a trip to Phoenix.

Pasties are tasty meat or vegetable pies meant to be lowered to hungry miners in Cornwall. Fortunately for us, someone thought of  bringing them to the US, and particularly to the Phoenix area. I had the Lamb Vindaloo (probably not an import from Cornwall), and my brother had the Balsamic Portabello. Both were delicious; the Vindaloo was spicy, but not too spicy. Go ahead and order it - you won't be sorry.  Since this was sort of dinner, we then shared the Pilgrim, which incorporated turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and a side of cranberry sauce. This was OK, but could have used more turkey, and less stuffing. Pies ranged from $6.50-9.00.

Excellent selection of European draft beers in 14, 20, and 34 ounce mugs, the largest being a mere $8-9 bucks. Also many imported premium bottles, plus Tempe's own Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (6%) for only $3.50. What a deal.

For other New Yorkers reading this, I understand Myers of Keswick, a shop on Hudson Street, has Cornish Pasties and other meat pies. They're generally less than $4.00, so probably smaller and for takeout only. I'll give you an update on this next time I'm down in the Village."}

They will not molly coddle and treat you like you are some sort of special patron. They are just too busy providing some of the best pasties ever created. Service is not what you come here for, pasties are!

Be sure to ask them what the Vegan selections are, they are usually pretty amazing. Especially if you put gravy on them! (The gravy is totally not vegan, neither am I...having evolved as an omnivore). 

Now they have a patio, as well as more seating and a nice bike rack! Classing it up CP! Just kidding, this place is not classy, which is why it is so beautiful and amazing."}

I had bookmarked this as a place I wanted to try a while back and I wasn't disappointed.  Never before had I had a pasty.  Clearly, I've been missing out!  

This place is a dark, dimly lit british pub-style restaurant.  It was completely slammed, with loads of mostly college aged people.  Everyone seemed to be laughing, talking, and having a genuinely good time.  We sat at the best seats in the house, the bar, and got to watch the staff work their magic. From there, you could see most of the kitchen work as well as the bar work.  Always fun, and the staff were plenty entertaining, ha ha.

My wife and I each tried a pasty to share, me the Oggie, and Stacy had the shepherds pie.  The Oggie is their traditional pasty, with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. So good!  I also tried some of my wife's, which was very good as well.  In addition, we split an order of the chips (fries).  The food took a while, but it's all made fresh and baked, and very much worth the wait.  It was cooked to perfection!

We had a GREAT experience here, and can't wait to go back.  Do yourself a favor and go check them out!"}

The joy of eating such delicious and American adapted English cuisine makes me very emotional. Satisfying me mentally, physically and culturally.

In a world where people actually rate gross, breaded, stale fish patty's from Pete's fish & chips as legit British food I had given up on life. How could such basic and easy British cuisine be so poorly executed? Maybe it's the desert heat? Even Brit owned restaurants here are poor... until now.

There is no wonder they are spreading across the valley so quick. The parts here are incredible and they have approx 1 billion options. There is only one style of Cornish pasty in England but the owner has adapted a bunch different styles and flavours in order to keep hold the average Americans attention (this can be difficult).

Overall a great experience, even though this place feels a bit like a dungeon I'm really ok with this as the teriyaki pasty gives me life."}

The interior is like a dive bar with little to no lighting, not what you'd expect from a pasty place, and it looks closed from the outside. Don't let that put you off - the pasties are fantastic which is why it gets 5 starts from me! Extensive selection of vegetarian and even a few vegan choices, plus creative flavor combos. I've eaten many a Cornish pasty in my time, having frequented Cornwall quite a few times while growing up. These are really really good! The pastry is excellent and the fillings generous. My favorites are the Veggie "Chicken' Tikka Masala, Veggie Asiago "Chicken", and Veggie Mexican. They even ship...hmm, tempting!"}

Arrived right when they opened and was the first one to get served. Sweet!

This location is definitely set up with the college kids in mind. Inside is very dark with black painted ceiling tiles and walls. Looks like the basement of a really old bar or maybe even a coal mine. Great place to gather up with the crew and down a few pints and then chow down on some tasty grub.

Their west side entrance has a long sit down bar with a few small tables and is rather cramped. The east side entrance has more of a full seating area with additional bar seating. Recommend using the east side one unless you are going undercover and need a quick escape.

Started with a cup of Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton soup. It came with bread and butter and was very good. Ordered the Peppered Steak Pasty which is filled with Sirloin Steak, sautéed Portobello Mushrooms, Leeks, roasted Zucchini, and Stilton Bleu Cheese. It also came with a side of yummy Peppercorn Brandy Cream sauce.

Everything was very satisfying. There are so many different versions of what they can make. Lamb, Chicken, Pork, Beef, and Veggie are just some of the fillings. I suppose you could make a check list and try them all. Hmmm?

Don't forget some Dessert if you still have room. Can't wait to explore more of their delicious menu. Would probably go to the new Scottsdale location or the Mesa one on my next visit. Same great food with more lighting and better suited for a blind old fogey like me. PARTY ON TEMPE!

Strictly speaking Cornwall is far far away from Dublin, but it was close close to where I was working on St. Patty's this year, and I knew I wouldn't likely run into green beer. 

Bingo. I have often done delivery of CPC 'samazing grub, but shockingly have never been inside. I was impressed. Mid day darkness isn't my usual m.o. but I was diggin it. Narrow and cozy, it truly was like going back to Ireland. It was the closest thing to a pub I have seen in AZ.

I ordered my Manger's Cider at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the kitchen staff: friendly young guys who were enjoying life. I am a fan of enjoying life while you are working, and I am always sure to have a good meal when the staff is doing so. Got a chicken pot pie pasty, chips with malt vinegar. Good stick to your ribs lunch fare. Red wine gravy was two thumbs up caliber.

Expensive, came to 21 bucks with tip, more than my usual lunch budget allows, but ok for a splurge. 

I feel I did my Irish duty and definitely think this lunch counts for more than a green tie.

My husband got himself a peppered steak, I grabbed a salmon asparagus pocket and my daughter snagged a meats and cheese version. Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale. 
Right away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier.
I was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated.
I could bring my veggie friends/family here too.
I knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go!
Update: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy."}

Favorite: Rosemary chicken and always, always end with a banoffee. There have been many occasions I just called to get a dessert to go. And they have delicious iced teas! Always a perk.

He wanted to explain everything since it was my first visit.  This was not my first rodeo in a Que restaurant so I didn't need to hear how long the meat was smoked "longer than other places".  First, I ordered a frozen strawberry Margarita - I sent it back because there was barely a strawberry taste.  I then ordered the Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade.  They need to add more strawberries to their strawberry drinks.  Next, came the biscuits with apple butter - great but it is not your traditional southern apple butter.  I had the 7oz brisket - it was served in one inch rectangles and not slices.  It was good but it still had fat.  It was easy to remove.  However, I could not taste the smoke.  Maybe it should be smoked much longer than other other places.  On the table there are three types of sauces - Memphis, original, and hot & spicy.  Except for the Memphis, the other too were watery but good.  The bake beans were delicious.  For the price I was expecting much more.  I will try and find a Que joint instead of a Que restaurant next time."}

Tender with a rich smoky flavor which is really unique to Four Peaks. They serve it with black beans, rice (which I don't eat), sour cream and two big, soft, warm tortillas. It's not spicy but I add some additional kick with some AZ hot sauce. They recommend a Hop Knot which I love but I actually prefer the 8th street with this meal, just a bit lighter. 

Today's visit was very nice, our waiter was very attentive offering samples of the beer, water and checked on us often. Our food came out crazy fast. A woman who I think was the manager came by and checked on us. The bus boys removed our plates quickly. We walked around to look at the building and a gentleman from the back area came to speak with us and gave us a bit of history on the building.

Friday night (4/8/16) we yelped Tempe looking for a cool place to hang out and grab some beers with some friends . we decided to try Four Peaks Brewing Co.  We arrived around 9 pm and the place was packed but we managed to find a seat, the waitress was very nice and gave us the list of the specials. I was impressed with the beer flight, most places offer only 4 beers in a flight, not four peaks ... they gave us 8 to try and for 10 dollars we thought it was a great deal . we also tried the Odelay beer which was a Mexican chocolate beer, it was very smooth and delicious. We ordered the pretzels, they were nice and soft and salty just like a pretzel should be but the cheese that came with it was watery and very bland. Also, the waitress didn't tell his the cheese was extra and I was a little taken back realizing the watery cheese was not apart of the appetizer but was side order that cost 2.00. I wouldn't have mind the charge if maybe the cheese was actually tasty. I'm glad I got to try this place and I would go back for the beers."}

Having the bright tanks and the brewing equipment right where you sit and drink their beer, was a fantastic idea. It makes the space look much larger and if you are anything like me - I like to know how they make the brew, with this set up you can see it right before your eyes!

 I've recently made the AZ Peach my favorite summer time brew! It's so light and refreshing - you can taste the peach, but it's not overwhelming. If you don't believe me, Try it! You can most likely find it at one of your local restaurant and pubs. I frequent the Uncle Bears by our house they offer the tasty delight. AHH!!!

I haven't had much of the menu so I can't really say - but I really enjoyed the environment and I just can't believe I haven't been here before!!!

Don't wait! Check it out! I will update as soon as I have a proper meal, but their beer is so good, I expect the same!!

Until then Yelpers!"}

Since she has well trusted culinary instincts (in my book, at least), I insisted that we try it out the next time I was there...and we have been going every time since!

I don't like beer (even though I keep trying to convince myself), but will never stop me from coming here! The food is absolutely delish! My go-to is the chicken beer bread sandwich. While the beer bread is actually more like a flat bread and doesn't have a strong beer flavor, I cannot get enough of it! They should cut it up in triangles and serve it as an app!! They have enormous hearty salads and other really good dishes too, but I still can't veer from that sandwich- which is easily big enough for 2 to share.

Oh, and how could I forget about dessert? There is an oatmeal stout milkshake that is different, yet oh-so-good, even for those that despise beer (this has been tested out).

If you're ever around ASU- and even if you have to drive a half hour (or more) to get here, it is worth it. Sit on the patio to catch some rays while you eat/drink, or in the brewery to admire the beer being made while you guzzle some down yourself...."}

There's some parking in their private lot, but it fills up quickly, so you might be better off looking in the shopping plaza that abuts Casey Moore's or on the street.

Casey's is too smokey, too. But, if you avoid it Thursday - Saturday, it's a cool place to go in the early afternoon. My best friend and I chilled out here one sunny afternoon. It was very relaxing. Yet, I soon saw that even at 5 p.m., the place starts to fill up quickly. So, if you don't mind noise and you like commotion, this is a sure bet.

Quite the impressive-looking establishment, and as other reviews have stated, very busy. 

Sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and let me sample both the regular Kilt Lifter and the seasonal Bonehead Red. Both tasted very good and confirmed that they indeed still make very legit beer, and maybe the 6-pack I bought just went sour. It's traveling from 2-hours away after all. I also ordered some happy hour rib tips w/slaw. Both the BBQ glaze and slaw were very sweet, and I forgot how much more boney rib tips are. But it's a brewery after all, and the other food is probably good, but mostly serves to soak up the beer. 

A nice spot to try some very good beer, hang out with a group and watch some sports. Definitely worth a visit."}

Waitress took forEVER to come to our table. When she finally came around, she couldn't have acted more annoyed with helping us. She constantly looked over her shoulder or in a different direction the entire time I ordered. To the point of making me feel stupid. I couldn't even tell if she was listening to me.
Our drinks and appetizer came out fairly quick. Never did see said snotty waitress again (must've been bothering her at the end of her shift). Someone else started coming around even though she was never quite clear if she was our new waitress at that point. Sigh. Extremely horrible waitressing aside, the loaded nachos with beef (not really that spicy) were delicious. Beer samples were fun.
Waitress took so long to come around to ask if we were ready to order an entree, that by the time we were done with the nachos, we were getting full and decided to head out. Would've been nice to try something else,  but I was pretty done with the service at that point. What a turn off.
Even though the waitresses ruined my time, I'm still giving three stars because the food (what little I did have) was delicious and you can't go wrong with beer and outdoor patio seating. If I could rate the service itself, I'd give 1 star.
Would go back again either way. ;)"}

Tonight was much different. My party of 3 shared a pitcher of the Peach ale *mmm* and while they both had burgers, I had the chicken sandwich with cheddar on beer batter bread by request. I had no idea what the beer batter bread was, but I saw a lot of good reviews about it so I went for it. Got my sammy, it came with tomatoes and onions which did not please me, but was not a deal breaker. I got the chicken cajun though which definitely made the sandwich for me.

This experience def made Four Peaks a place worth visiting again for me. But beware! We came on a Fri. evening and there were HELLA people in line...so either come early, or be prepared for a wait."}

Four Peaks in Tempe is tucked just blocks from the ASU campus. There is ample parking and we came early in order to make it to a White Sox game that evening.

All were tasty. No slouch in the bunch.  Food was excellent. I had a slow roasted pork dish and my wife had a BBQ pizza. Both solid.  I asked for a taste of the Bourbon barrel aged Raj and that was the pick of the litter. An attentive manager stopped by to see how we were doing and also dropped by a couple of other barrel aged tastes (A very nice touch). The Imperial Russian Stout was good enough to bring a four pack back to Chicago.  A great place. Highly recommended for beer, food, service and ambiance."}

Whether you're there for happy hour and appetizers or you're there for a full meal with drinks, or heck...just drinks, you cannot go wrong with this place. If you live in Phoenix, and you haven't been there please do yourself a favor and stop by. You will not regret it.

Shortly afterward, a manager came over, told us how great their service is and how they work as a team and then took our order. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. Usually one of the best things about a bbq restaurant is that the food comes out quickly. Not here! It was at least a half hour before we got our food, sans one side that wasn't ready yet. We finished eating and then had to wait again for a to go box and our check. (Server was oblivious and never looked our way so we could get his attention.) And by the way, the prices are sky high. Especially for BBQ, though the food was pretty good. Biscuits were delicious. Kind of a cross between a scone and biscuit...a little sweet."}

I had the fried catfish...it was just ok. Too much batter and the fish and batter both needed salt. The portions are massive so I think if we go back we will most likely split something.

Fortunately we were seated right away. The service here is exceptional. Our waitress was very prompt with bringing our drinks and food, and even with clearing our table. We enjoyed the peach ale and the Mexican coffee stout. We also tried the hefe. We enjoyed them all. The  peach ale was very peachy. The stout was chocolate and coffee flavored. The hefe tasted as described, with a strong banana aroma and flavor. We kinda felt that the same yeast was used on the hefe and the stout, as the stout had clover and banana flavors as well. Never the less, both were quite enjoyable. The fries are amazing, thick and flaky. We had the southwest burger and the chicken beer bread. The chicken beer bread is listed under sandwiches, but is much closer to a wrap. Instead of a tortilla, it is wrapped in a thick fluffy gordita style wrap. The southwest burger was not too spicy with a jalapeño aloli, and we liked pouring chipotle ranch over it. The burger was a little dry, even though we ordered it medium rare. Over all, we enjoyed the food, drinks, and service. Wish we would have happened to come for happy hour! Looks like beer is a dollar off for happy hour."}

Local beers are awesome and this place does it best.

Usually I have a great service, but occasionally I've had terrible service (bad servers but still great food/beer).

Seriously, do it."}

I just moved here from SC and should probably move back if this is what AZ considers BBQ.  The grits I had were more like a soup made with cornmeal, terrible.  My beef rib was so sickly sweet I really didn't enjoy it.  The pulled pork was a total nightmare, it came in a pool of liquid making me think that it was recooked in a liquid to warm it back up, it lacked flavor and really had no smoke taste.  The tri-tip was boring.  The sweet tea was more like tea flavored simple syrup.  The thing that was supposed to be a sugar covered biscuit was hard and crispy, not like any biscuit I've ever had

This place was completely underwhelming.  I make better bbq at home in my oven.  I can certainly buy better in a prepackaged super market.  

Not to mention my lunch cost $20.  I will never eat here again"}

-Location: Close to ASU, Plenty of outside tables to enjoy the Arizona Sun and People Watch. I sat at the bar and watched all of the NCAA Conference Tournament Action. 

-Beer: All of their beers were really nice, I was especially impressed by these beers... 

-Kilt Lifter -Scottish Style Ale - Amazing, I rate it a 8.5! It is like drinking a New Castle on Steroids!! Very low carbonation, tons of malt and light hop flavor. 
-Hop Knot IPA -- Amazing, almost an Imperial IPA very Hop Forward without the bitter hops!! I rate it 9.3 Even better from the Cask. 
-8th Street Ale -- Pale Ale -- Very nice session able Pale Ale, I rate it at a 7.0 -- Very easy drinking with subtle hops. 

I did not eat a meal here so I won't comment, there menu looked amazing with a lot of variety. I ordered the Bavarian Soft Pretzels and they were perfect (I am a Soft Pretzel Connoisseur being from Philadelphia). They are so good with any beer at Four Peaks!!! 

Overall...Great Place to look at Beautiful Women, Drink Great Beer, Look at Beautiful Women, Eat Great Food, Look at Beautiful Women, and watch great sport's I mention the women?"}

I fell in love with 4 peaks back when I lived in Tempe and began my 10 year college career (I took my time :) / :( ).  My roommates and I heard the beer was delicious and they had a bunch of different kinds to try on happy hour, some beers with higher alcohol content which is really what got me interested.  The RAJ IPA was amazing and is one of my favorite beers there but after a few times of getting drunk faster than everyone else and going home early ( or falling asleep in, on, under or around tables)  I decided to branch out and try the other beers.  Being brewed here in AZ they are all superb, fresh and delicious, the food here is also good, not amazing its not gourmet by any means but its a little "different" than typical bar food (wings and sandwiches), think Zipps.  For example Four Peaks has beer bread, Zipps has focaccias which isn't like focaccia at all but its good and different, there's nothing like it anywhere else than these 2 restaurants, you will have to see it or try it to really understand.  Either way if you feel like beer, good beer look no where else, unless your in Flagstaff then you have to go to Beaver Street Brewery which is also an excellent brewery in AZ."}

I like this place a lot more when its on a dead night. Fridays & Saturdays there are just way too many people. I usually order whatever's on special, most of the times when I go it happens to be Kilt Lifter. Good beer. Service is not so great, never has been for me. Even dining there (inside) wasnt outstanding service. Although, the food was good. I cant remember what I even had since I rarely order food there. Try to go upstairs, I did once and no one was up there.. it was kind of creepy. Not too sure of the whole "haunted" thing, but it adds to the bar's charm.

I do like this bar, a lot of my friends are regulars and mostly can be found there on any given day. I do like the type of crowd that goes to Casey's, at least on the nights I've been. The place would be a hell of a lot better if they somehow found a way to expand because I literally get claustrophobic on the busier nights. In an bar thats outdoors that just seems odd. lol. Also, the parking situation sucks.. the ratio of parking spots to bar goers is not proportionate.

I didn't really believe anybody when they told me that I just had to find the beer that was right for me because I honestly thought at that point ALL BEER was disgusting...

But then I found my best friend - PEACH ALE! Man that stuff is SO GOOD and a pitcher b/w 3-4 friends makes for a great time.

Food is legit, people are awesome, and there are multiple environments in which to hang out in.
Large party? Get a table inside where it's a little louder.
Here casually w a friend? Check the bar out.
Trying to catch up over dinner and drinks w/ a small group? Try to sit outside.

This place is definitely a place to hit up even if you're in Tempe for just the weekend.

Believe it or not the oysters are pretty good. Personally, I'm not a fan of the raw oyster's but I love their rendition of Oyster's Rockafeller. I think there lunch specials are also another bright spot of this establishment. If you add them on their facebook, they sometimes post their specials.

Aside from their food, their drink selection is rather simple. They don't really offer anything that I can't get anywhere else. The happy hour is not really mind-blowing either. I think a dollar off drafts and specials on wells if I remember correctly.

Really, what you are paying for is the ambiance. I get that it's historic and it's got an irish pub type theme, but I didn't really think it was anything special.

Oh, I forgot to mention, if you do decide you visit (and if you are male) if you have to use the blarney stone restroom on the outside patio. It's basically a simulated rock fountain that you pee on. Now that I think about it, I guess it sounds more fun after a few pints..."}

It is one of Arizona's oldest microbreweries and since the demise of the historic A-1 brand, the closest thing we have to a state beer.  Many microbreweries these days seem to focus on bitter super-hopped beers with other varieties being a second-class after thought.  While Four Peaks does offer the hoppy Raj IPA and the even hoppier Hop-Knot, it also has a wide selection of other excellent award-winning offerings across the entire style spectrum including their flagship Kilt-Lifter Scottish amber ale, the mild SunBru and the creamy Oatmeal Stout (the closest thing to Guinness you will find this side of Ireland).  At the brew pub, they always have one or two special seasonals including the annual spicy Pumpkin Porter.  

One would expect that a brew pub would have good beer, but what really sets Four Peaks apart from the rest is the excellent food.  Most brew pubs may have one or two stand-out dishes with most other items being more mediocre and less tasty than they sound.  However it is clear that Four Peaks has a true chef in the kitchen who is as innovative and passionate about the food as the brew masters are about the beer.  The Four Peaks burgers are among the best in Phoenix - large, juicy and perfectly cooked to order.  The attention to details shows in the trimmings - always fresh, large slices of lettuce, tomato and onion on a large fresh bun.  Likewise even the side salads (which are often no more than lettuce in most places) include mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, green peppers and croutons (in addition to their excellent homemade sweet jalapeno dressing).  Other stand-out items include excellent enchiladas, carne adovada, fish-n-chips, beer-battered fries, and several excellent appetizers including Thai hummus, killer nachos, and Arizona Chicken Rolls (a long fried spicy chicken and cheese egg roll).  All served in generous portions and very reasonable prices.

What really shows the kitchen's innovation and artistry however are the daily dinner specials (usually 3) that are special custom creations that have ranged from fine dining to comfort food to off-the-wall inventive.  A few examples include duck manicotti in a cabernet sauce, a sandwich of fried chicken and gravy served between waffles instead of bread and (my sentimental favorite) homemade sloppy joes with tater tots.  Four Peaks is one of the few brew pubs I know that could be successful on its food alone even without the beer.

The brewery is located on a neighborhood side street (8th Ave) near ASU in a historic brick building that used to be a creamery.  The large open inside has a huge wrap-around bar and several large TVs for sporting events and can get loud when busy.  I prefer the nice outside patio.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the wait staff is consistency friendly and attentive.  On weekends, there can sometimes be a wait for a table and parking (on the street) can occasionally be a challenge.   I have eaten at probably over four dozen brew pubs around the US and would rank Four Peaks among the top three for overall beer, food, service, and atmosphere."}

Although a chain, they did have both from San Tan Brewery and Four Peaks on tap. Two of each. A solid plus to the usual bud, bud-light, coors, coors light sameness.

The server who we ordered them from left and never brought them but 10 minutes later someone else asked us if we wanted drinks so we reordered and they came in another 5 minutes. Then after awhile, another person took our order and I ordered a salad 1st and specifically asked for it 1st and it never came. When our meals came, I told the 4th person we spoke to to cancel my salad. My friend ordered the corn and asked for extra butter for it. It never came so we stopped a server (#5) and asked for melted butter. He said "no problem"! But....never returned. We flagged down a female manager who apologized and went to get it. By the time my friend got butter, the corn was cold. We were there for approximately 1hr and 30 min and I got burnt ends and iced t and my friend got a tri tip sandwich and an iced t. Simply ridiculous. Never was asked about appetizers, never asked if we wanted dessert and never were we checked on during the meal.

I really wanted to change things up a bit to keep things fun. My wife and I like many are partial to great beer and great food. Throw a different location on top thats not the usual food chain and sometimes you get lucky. I live in north Phoenix so this was about a 40 to 45 minute drive. Well after all said and done very worth it. Went on a Saturday night and expected a long wait.... I don't even know how long we ended up waiting. That's because we were able to hang out at the bar and try some beers. Next thing you know we were at a table ordering food. Staff was friendly and punctual. Food was out quick and very pleased with the quality. Here are the bads. Parking pretty limited and it's far from our house. My wife was commenting on how she wishes there was one closer. Wants to try more of the food! Me too."}

He was really knowledgeable and seemed like he was having fun with it as well. His well-timed jokes and enthusiasm for Four Peaks made the tour really enjoyable for me. At the beginning of the tour, he gave us two drink tickets. You could either get a beer flight (comes with 8 small but generous glasses) or 2 pints. Some beers are excluded, so make sure to check with your bartender.

The tour was great and the beers were tasty as well. My favorite was the peach ale. I would have gladly given Four Peaks a 5 star review, but after the tour we were able to redeem those drink tickets that Remy gave us; however, we weren't given any seating. Instead, we had to go back to the hostess and ask for a table. The bar was really crowded, and there was no way we could find a spot for six people. They told us it would be a 20 minute wait. I wish they would have let us known so that maybe we could have left the tour for a couple minutes to put our names down."}

I was one of the lucky ones who started going there the week they opened and what seemed like every week there-after until I moved about two years ago.  When I have been back, I've been saddened to see how hard it is just to get a table outside.  The service has always been so-so, but the food, beer and music have always been excellent.  Kiltlifter and 8th Street are my favorite beers and for some reason I love the garlic cheese beer bread as simple as it is.  

I've been to the one in Scottsdale and it is not nearly as cool as the original.

Somehow, with the disgusting 2-stall girls' restroom, no parking, high bar prices, no good waitresses, and pint-only beer options, this place maintains it's hipster popularity as "the place" to be in downtown Tempe. 

I honestly do not know why I go, but I say yes when my friends decide to invite me here. The only reason why I give it two stars is because of the ability to be a hot spot when everything on Mill is dying. This is due to sheer lack-of-caring about their customers, which college attendees and awkward single older men inside seem to be drawn to. 

Last time, the lack of caring was what threw me over the edge. I was waiting at the bar and I was almost next! So excited to finally pay over $4 for a pint of beer (which was their happy hour special), when a guy moved to the right of me and started up a conversation with the bartender. He obviously knew him, and the conversation continued, without the bartender helping anyone, for at least 4-5 minutes. I finally said to a waitress, "Can I get a drink or is this bartender just going to ignore me?" She replied, "Oh, these guys can talk all night. That's just how our bartenders are!"

You'd think by how much money Casey's is making, they'd improve their restrooms. One girls' restroom with only two toilets for a packed-bar is just unsanitary at the end of most nights.  

My husband says the oysters are good and fresh, but that's no reason to go back for us.   I am no whiney-40 year old- I'm an ASU student who does love the college bar scene- I just wish Casey's would take better care of the people who keep them in business."}

If your into shrimp they have a salad with 5 huge prawns and avocado that looks too good to be healthy!  Fresh greens, tomato and did I mention 5 huge prawns?  Very yummy looking.

Rustic charm with the comfort of a dependable chain.  Yummy food and very large portions.  The drinks are strong, and water comes in giant mason jars.  

Since I had already eaten at Lucille's in California twice that month before coming here, I decided to get some fish instead of my usual BBQ meat.  

I wanted to try the catfish but was told it would be spicy, so I went with the salmon instead.  You can get it smoked or grilled, and it's served with a generous portion of Creole rice and fresh vegetables and slathered with their New Orleans mustard cream sauce.  The food was really good and I was stuffed.  

I also tried Lucille's Spiced Rum Punch, which you can get a 16 oz carafe for two, and it's cheaper than ordering two individual drinks.  ;)  It was a pretty pink color and sweet and refreshing."}

Lucille's used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but they've changed. Either somebody picked off my plate before it got to me or I just paid $20 for 3 or 4 forkfulls of dry brisket. I think they were supposed to be slices. It was more like a handful of brisket chips. They were tough and tiny. No flavor to them whatsoever. No mop sauce. No smoke. No taste. I had to put salt on it. Side dishes should not dwarf your entree. There was more corn and potatoes than there was beef. There's no beef shortage that I'm aware of, and this wasn't Kobe beef, so I have to question. I doubt very much that was 7 oz even pre-cooked weight. Apparently it was $20 corn and potatoes, and I didn't get any biscuits like it says it comes with. I'm fluent in TX and Southern BBQ. This is just ridiculous. I'm just gonna go to Rudy's next time. If I'm gonna pay $20 for brisket, there better be some brisket on the plate!"}

The next day there was a hundred dollar fraudulent purchase on my account. Four peaks had been THE ONLY place i had used my card in months. Obviously a server snatched my info. My husband and i brought our six month old there recently and when they brought us our childs chair it was covered in food, a rather large piece of pretzel was laying right in it. I wipe down high chairs anyway, but someone could have at least attempted to make it presentable. Bringing me that filthy high chair for my baby is basically just flipping me the bird.

I have been here several times so I am surprised that I have not written a review yet.

Each time I have been here, the food has been very good.  I have tried a range of BBQ dishes including the Baby Backs, Tri-Tip, Brisket and Pulled Pork.  Each meat has been great.  Many sides to choose from.  Baked Beans, sweat potato mashed, regular and garlic mashed, etc.  The Mac and Cheese is probably not their best dish.  Biscuits are good as is the corn bread.  I also enjoy the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer. 

Service is usually very good and attentive.  This last visit, I was a little disappointed about the ability to keep drinks full. It seems anywhere I have been going lately wait staff has a very hard time paying attention to drinks.  This to me is a huge service error and likely to always cost a restaurant an extra star. 

I have also had desserts there although not this last time, Too Full!!  

It is a great location.  Parking is always available although on weekends you may have to walk from back lot a little as this location shares with Dave and Busters and Cadillac Ranch.

Overall, a very good dinner on Friday night!!"}

As for the stoutamisu - i'm a huge fan of traditional tiramisu, so wasn't sure if i'd like this version. Once again, Four Peaks has proven me wrong (and so did my brother who insisted I try both). In this version, the lady fingers are soaked in Oatmeal Stout and has the most incredible chocolate cream covering the outside along with chocolate shavings! This is an awesome twist on the classic, especially since I usually don't like stout, i happily ate this dessert :) As for the portion, it's huge - i think one slice was the length of my forearm and the width my forearms combined!"}

1.This is supposed to be THE place to go for oysters, fish, drinks, etc. The food was NOT impressive. Everything lacked flavor and at the same time everything tasted the same. no distinctive flavors. The fish didn't taste like fish, the fries didn't taste like fries, etc... I went simple thinking i'd better try something "safe" so I had the Fish & chips platter. the fish was mediocre... the batter was thin, not crispy at all. It had no salt, flavor, or seasoning whatsoever. I've actually had better fried fish @ Mimi's Cafe and Tom's BBQ, neither of which specialize in fish and it was 1000 times better. The side dishes were met with the same lack of seasoning. The fries were limp and had absolutely no salt. The coleslaw was dry, had no flavor and was hard for me to even get through one single bite.

2. I was NOT impressed at all with the property or location. The property is just "ok".  The only reason it's a big deal is because it is a historic house in the "downtown Tempe area" that has been converted into a bar/restaurant. It just has lots of busy posters, lights,and all the groovy stuff bars normally have. Nothing out of the ordinary... Location - It's not in the heart of Tempe at all..., it's in a neighborhood just around the corner from the "heart of Tempe". Like I mentioned before. It's a converted house, therefore as you can imagine, it is in a residential neighborhood. They have a patio, which is pretty much unbearable to sit out there 9 out of 12 months during the year, and the inside is small, dark and cramped. There isn't much to see outside anyway other than hippies, skateboarders and homeless people coming out of the alley way behind the circle K up the street.

3. The service is not spectacular either. I walked in and was greeted by NO ONE. Since the patio is the first thing you walk in to, you have no idea where to go when you're there! There are people sitting and drinking & eating all around, but no greeter, server or anyone to seat you are even tell you where to go. I did what seemed logical and walked IN to the actual house and you run right into the bar. The bartender pretty much just looked at me and said "grab a menu and sit anywhere"... WOW! It took about 5 minutes for a server to even notice I was there waiting to be attended to.

This was my first visit and needless to say my LAST!!!!"}

I also received a free beer for my birthday so I ordered one of their seasonal beers--the Pumpkin Porter--which was so delicious! We also got their salted pretzels which had too much salt for me, but the mustard it came with was the perfect dip. We paid extra for a jalapeno cheese dip that comes with the pretzels but I prefer the mustard as the cheese dip was too spicy. I ordered the veggie burger which was very yummy with the peach ale; Also, I LOVE how their food menu suggests a good beer that will go with each food item!

This was a lot of fun for me.

1) I have never seen so many different kinds of bar flies in one place. In Seattle, having 10 million bars means that each one can serve its own perfectly isolated niche (e.g., bearded heavy metal knitting enthusiasts). I guess living in a town that mainly has tumbleweeds and meth to offer means that on Friday night, everybody looking to party ends up in the same place.... soccer moms, goths (really? still?), bros, and yes, hipsters, all gettin' wasty in their own corner of this sprawling bar.

2) Property is pretty cheap in AZ, I guess - this place is huge!! That was fun.

3) MMMmm I ate the hummus and pita it was delicious.

4) I can't believe how absurdly freaking cheap it is to drink in this town!! God, why'd I ever move to the Pacific Northwest? I shoulda moved to Tempe!! Oh wait... this would be the *only* place I'd ever go."}

Yes. its a huge portion except majority of it looks like chips and pita bread. i would not mind all of it if the spinach artichoke dip was endless. ;) Now on the other hand i have tried their beer battered bread sandwiches and their popper burger which was not spicy to me what so ever. it was amazing as well do not get me wrong but just wasn't what i was expecting. 

Lets get to the beer. the kiltlifter is good but not Amazing. My absolute Favorite beer here of course has to be the seasonal Pumpkin Porter. The oatmeal stout is not bad either i still like guiness better than the oatmeal stout though.

Last but not least the customer service has always been amazing thank god. Only downside is when its a night of a game or weekend it is packed in there. id prefer to go during happy hour before the rush or during the day or as long as i'm not the driver i could really care less i just happen to be impatient and don't want to have to stand 30 minutes to wait for a table to clear up.

Also, I wish i got this younger girls name that is a bartender here because she was absolutely amazing!! Best One i have ever met randomly! As i have been sick for almost 3 months with a weird cough thing going on she offered me hot water and honey since my boyfriend and his friends were drinking.

I say this because while we were at other breweries in Arizona talking about where we were going, several people told us we could skip them because they're the big, mass produced brewery. 

While it may be true that smaller breweries can have more fun with their beer, it by no means says that this brewery isn't good. 

Though it has a large seating area for the restaurant, it also has about 20,000 barrels of brewing equipment visible. It is right near campus so it can either be a convenient place to go if you're staying on campus, or annoying if you dislike the college crowd. We were there during a home football game so it was filled with people, but was not rambunctious. 

We got a sample board and it was a pretty big sample board. I liked all of the beer I tasted. Their IPA and their Porter were both very good.

The staff is also very friendly and prompt. We got to talking about the brewery with our server and he brought over one of the brewery employees. After mentioning that I work in a brewery in Indy, he offered to give us a quick tour of the brewery, which was very nice.

If you're brewery hopping for the day or are just planning a visit to Tempe, don't let people sell you off Four Peaks just because they're the larger of the breweries."}

Our favorite day each year is St. Paddy's Day and a visit to Four Peaks for there Oatmeal Stout. I think the tradition in the upcoming year is about to change. The stout ain't like it use to be. Creamy , with that rich malty, chocolate, flavor. Now it has a more citrus tone to it. Why on earth would they mess in what was in my top 3 stouts of all time? Very disappointing. 
The food is still good but star of the show like a star in the sky that burns out in time, so has Four Peaks Brewing."}

All the beer is brewed on site which means everything is fresh -- they actually use the same water they serve at the tables in the brewing process, to give you an idea how pure the finished product is. 

No matter if you're there to eat or knock a few back Peaks is a must. You can't go wrong with virtually anything on the menu but anyone happening upon Peaks for the first time should absolutely order an entree or side of the fries, an undisputed favorite. I usually go with anything involving blackened chicken, be it salad or nachos.

The sampler trey is offered at a reasonable price and provides about 4 oz servings of each of the beers listed on the big board. If you're looking for something lighter I would suggest the Sunbru or Peach -- my personal favorite is doing a half & half of Oatmeal Stout with Peach. Get inventive.

Our server couldn't be bothered to smile or even make eye contact, let alone visit our table in any semblance of a timely fashion. We had to flag her down to place our order, after waiting fifteen minutes with the menus closed. She never visited our table to see if we might need more water or another drink. If it was only the server I would guess she was just having a bad day, but the front desk was also rude. There was a bouncer at the front who just stood there with his hand out and didn't say a word, I had to watch others to figure out I had to show him my ID. What's wrong, meathead, is the phrase, "hello sir may I see your ID" above your vocabulary level???

I had the eighth street ale with my meal, which was okay, but not worth any of the other rave reviews I've read here. For an ale, it was very simplistic and safe, basically tasted like any consistent ale you would get from a large mega-brewery such as Sam Adams. The best thing about the place is the music, which better be good because there is no way you are going to have a conversation in there without shouting your lungs out. Too bad that there is not much else to do while waiting, waiting, and waiting for someone to take your order, get around to bringing it to you, and eventually think about the concept of a check."}

It's probably one of the more unique bars I've ever seen & it fits right in with the cute Maple/Ash neighborhood.

The oysters are always really fresh; the drinks are strong (though the Bloody Marys have a weird taste to them... not sure what that's about) and everything non-oyster I've gotten has been good too. Happy Hour is great; half a dozen oysters for $7!

The whole place is a cool atmosphere to hang out with a friend and get toasted. I like that it's always reasonably busy, even at 10 pm on a Sunday (so I don't feel awkward being one of 3 tables in an empty restaurant, and the vibe stays upbeat) but not so busy you can't get a server to take notice of you. 
The inside is dark & cool and feels like an old bar in somewhere like Boston. The patio is dog-friendly, with tons of foliage & shade, and misters.

The only negative is some of the staff seem to have attitudes. 
- The door guy arbitrarily cards people; he'll let 5 frat dudes of questionable age in no problemo, but then makes me (at 26) dig out my ID & then scrutinizes it heavily. 
- The last 2 waitresses on the patio have turned their nose up when I ordered a water first while deciding on liquor/food & waiting for someone... then they disappeared for 15 minutes. Their attitudes magically change when you order a bunch of cocktails & food... Gosh, I wonder why."}

Stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon late,
I was rolling by myself, can't find a date,
I didn't order food but it all looked great,
Later I got on my board and went to go skate.

It's a cozy place on the inside and out,
Couldn't catch her eye but I didn't pout,
I don't mind cause she probably likes No Doubt,
That band sucks and Gwen Stefani has gout.

I sat at the bar and ordered Kilt Lifter,
It came in a pint and not in a snifter,
Slick, switch the 100 for a 10 like a grifter,
I got the chrome skull on my Jeep's shifter.

Going out on a limb to say best outside bar in Tempe,
Outside, on a wall is where the men go pee,

Full time single dad who's weekends are free.

Take the brewery tour. It's only $10 bucks, you learn about the family, the building and about the beer. It only takes 40 minutes and you get two free beer coupons. Win Win!
We were their on Saturday the 25th and after the tour we sat outside and had our complimentary beers and an edamame appetizer. We ordered the spicy chili and garlic. It wasn't too spicy, just right. And loaded with garlic. My wife and I can't get enough garlic so we were in heaven.
I have been here several times, had salmon, mac and cheese, and various other appetizers and meals. We have not been disappointed.
And their beer is some of the best around! Try ones you don't normally try, you'll be surprised."}

I really enjoyed hearing about the history of the building as well as learning about their brewing process. The $10 brewery tour comes with 2 drink tickets or 1 flight, which can be redeemed at the end of the tour. 

The only downside was that once the tour was over, we had to go back to the front, put our names down for a table, wait to get seated, and then order the drinks. It was really crowded, so our group of 6 ended up waiting more than 30 minutes for a table. I hope in the future, they would use that back space with tables for the tour guests. It was really inconvenient to have to wait for a table. 

The flight came with 8 (generous portions) glasses of different beers. My favorite was definitely the peach ale. It was light and refreshing, with the perfect amount of peach flavor. Our tour guide, Remy, also informed us about their water, which is super pure. And I can definitely agree with him that it was the best water I had in Arizona! It was tasteless and so clean. We also ordered a side of fries, which were amazing!! They were deliciously crispy, and I wish I can get some here in California!"}

good food to help your BAC:

Very funky and fun environment. The good news is that the fish and chips and fried clams were first rate and by themselves would justify many happy returns. So, good food, great ambience, and great service. 

The clam chowder was very good, but not world class. A little too creamy for my taste and a not enough chunky bits of clam and potato for my taste. Not bad, just had much better and tasty chowder. 

Did I mention that the drinks are cheap and the servers were all nice and in tune with our rhythms?  

So, the Oysters Rockefeller. I barely know what the say. We are somewhat experts in this cuisine having eaten Rockefeller in dozens of cities and several dozen restaurants.  These are the worst Oysters Rockefeller we have eaten in the last thirty years. I can't recall ever eating worse.  Almost inedible. If everything else wasn't so darn pleasant and my wife hates scenes, these would have been sent back charged guilty of tasting vile, not just suboptimal, but vile. 

Please chef, order the oysters Rockefeller at Durrants and contemplate the difference. Durrants downtown has some very good Rockefeller that bear zero resemblance to whatever it is they think they are serving here. 

I don't mean to be unpleasant but someone really has no clue."}

Good draft beer selection. Service at the bar was friendly and quick. Live music was good, not outstanding.
If you're a fan of good BBQ, then there are much better choices in Phoenix. Avoid Lucille's if you've ever had the opportunity to eat good Southern BBQ. This most definitely isn't it."}

Walking into here was not really what i expected looking at it from the outside as i notice these patio tables with older table clothes (don't quote me on that). My first impression was amazing the stuff was super busy and they where still able to say hello as we walk in. My first impression was comforting and as i sat down waiting for our server the smell of a smoker came to us and to notice there is really look like there is a smoker right behind us which i would have never have seen if it wasn't for the smell.

Now 30min have passed and no server. I really should have gave this 3 stars but once are sever came it change.

Server- Simone was our sever and me and my wife can say she turn it all around. Not looking tired or stress she greeted us with a smile.  She was very honest and recommended dishes that we will like. Fast with drinks and also recommended beer right off the bat. Thanks for selling me on the 5 beers i had. Overall Simone was what made our and made this 5 stars

Food- Per Simone she recommended we get the bbq two meat combo which was amazing. Came with two side dishes and two meats, the beef ribs and tri tip where to die for. The mac and cheeses was amazing and the sweet corn was the best the we ended up buying two more side dishes. If any of you do decided to come here get the two meat combo it will fill you guys both up


Next time I'm down here hope Simone is here and will sure be back with groups of friend. 

Ask for Simone best sever i have ever had."}

The beer is quite good.  I've tried most of their beers, and I think Raj IPA is my favorite.  The seasonal was the Pumpkin Porter and it fell a bit flat.  The flavor was too mellow and overall the beer seemed too light, almost watered down.

The real reason for 3 stars was the food.  Although we had some nice appetizers (pretzels with spicy cheese sauce were great, as was the Thai hummus and pita bread), but the pizzas we ordered were terrible. We ordered the margarita and the Italian.  The margarita had too much garlic powder, and the Italian tomato sauce was much too sweet and overpowered the toppings.

Service can be slow when they are busy, but our waitress was friendly and pretty attentive.  The dining area is enormous, and they also have some limited outdoor seating. But this is a college town dinner spot for sure, no pretensions of a high class brew-pub here.

I'll probably be back for the beer, but I hope I can find something on the menu better than those pizzas, which were truly awful!"}

It was crowded ...lots of people waiting around. But thankfully...for several reasons, we put our name down and waited for a table. I was very happy there was ample waiting area and the staff was very friendly. I went with my brother we waited less than 10 minutes for our table and this is on a Saturday at a busy dinner time . We were seated and immediately assisted by our waiter who was very attentive & explained the menu with any questions we had. Now if you've read any of my other reviews I am always a stickler for the menu explanations. there were some issues the wedge salad as the menu didn't state that it came with a lot of onions which I am NOT an onion fan but if you are then you will like the wedge salad. However the rest of our meal was delicious. I got the full rack of ribs with a baked potato and corn on the cob and this is just that little half corn on the cob you get the full  corn on the cob. My brother got the brisket which was delicious as well I wished I would have ordered that instead because I love brisket. the other wonderful thing is the food is not smothered in some sauces or even in the barbecue sauce itself.. The service was wonderful the food was delicious served hot and quickly and then we were on our way! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes to eat barbecue it's great for large groups. the only drawback which is why I didn't give it 5 stars is the waiting around is a little awkward in the front of the building where people are milling about and it's difficult to get through at times  people should be directed that they do not have to stand right in front to wait. I always find having to maneuver my way to put my name down for a table is always a pain. and with only one way in and one way out that's interesting during peak times. however we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the service was great we will be back!"}

Four Peaks is in the heart of Tempe and it's a great place to be. It has a good night scene, and during the day, it has the whole brunch atmosphere going on. It's relaxing without the dive look.

So whatever time during the day or night, Four Peaks is never a poor choice. The beer is good and the seasonal beers are even better. Food is good with fast and friendly staff too.

Love the burgers, the nachos and the chicken tenderloins. You should try the tiramisu dessert too!"}

It ended up working our perfectly so our table was ready right when we got there. It was extremely crowded with a lot of big parties. And despite all this, the service was incredible! Our waitress did a very good job of continually checking up on us and the food came out promptly after we ordered. And even if the service wasn't great, the food was exceptional! I got pulled pork and corn bread and both were delicious! I tried some of the food my family ordered and that too was very good. Plus, our table was in the bar so we were able to watch the baseball game and the golf tournament. Overall, my family and I had a very good experience at Lucille's!"}

All the food is freaking amazing!  They have daily specials which can be hit or miss based on principal alone (I'm semi-vegetarian and I ain't gonna eat beef), but unfortunately all the hits I've experienced I never again saw on the daily specials again.  They also have a beer float, but I'm just not that adventurous...  The Stoutimisu is excellent, but HUGE!

Great patio with both misters and heaters, depending on the season.

The bathrooms are notoriously crowded--desperate, I went into the men's bathroom, (I'm a girl), where I  shared a stall with some chick I didn't know--that was my second time to Casey's, but my first being hit on in a men's restroom. Also that night, a woman drunk to the point of crazed intensity, urinated herself and stumbled out onto the patio where--wet and googly eyed--she was accepted by the drunken and peaceful patrons. 

My third time to Casey's, I fell in love. Right there, under the Palm Tree whose white lights shine year round. 

My last time to Casey's,  a little over two years after we drank and laughed ourselves absolutely love sick under the night sky on the casually mooded patio,  even the chill Casey's vibe couldn't take away the uneasy chills and deep pitted anxiety of lost love. 

The drinks are strong, the patio's dreamy, the inside smells like beer rot, and Casey's usually leads to good conversation and an adventure."}

Pork Ribs-average.


The best item they have on the menu is their Beef ribs.  Oh my.  You cant get beef ribs at a lot of bbq joints, but Lucilles have the best in the valley.  They used to charge by half a rack or a full rack, now they charge by the bones.  (3,5,7)  The prices have gone up alot recently, but still you can't get beef ribs anywhere else that's close to theirs.

The sides are ok, nothing to rave about.  The biscuits are good with the cinnamon butter.

Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing.  It's like crack in a mason jar.  It's the best."}

I pretty much get this even though I know what I like cos it's good bang for your buck lol.

They do a really delicious vegetarian wrap-type of sandwich but I forget what it's called. However, what I REALLY want to highlight is that they have the MOST AMAZING Fish n Chips that I've had anywhere in Arizona so far! the batter is nice and crunchy but not too thick and it comes with fries/British style "chips" (not like Dave'n'Busters version of Fish n Chips where they actually give you chips) and tartar sauce...mmmmmmmmm! that's the way it should be!

The only thing that gets me down on this place a little bit is that there can be a pretty long wait sometimes so keep an eye out for spots opening up at the bar if your group isn't too big.

Went for my boyfriend's birthday with our whole family at the start of October. Our waiter was excellent and very friendly (he even gave my aunt a back massage when she jokingly asked for one when he asked if we needed anything else).

The food wasn't too expensive for what it is supposed to be. Pricing is reasonable.  Food quality was sub par for everyone in the party.

We ordered beef and pork ribs as well as a steak and some shrimp.   Appetizers were delicious, but the meats were very underwhelming.  Two of the people in our group left feeling queasy from the odd tasting sauce on their ribs.

The biscuits and butter were fantastic though, and I may go back just to have the spinach dip appetizer and biscuits one night.  Maybe we went on an off night."}

My down home girlie girl, who, bless her sweet heart and wonderbread palate, absolutely adores this joint. 

To start, the service was absolutely atrocious. Party of eight on a Friday night. Annoying? I can see how it could be. More annoying? Losing the reservation and shoving us into a corner designed to seat five, maybe six max. A bunch of elbow bumping, scantily clad chicks all dolled, sipping fruity ass hurricanes and the like. Probably pretty humorous to observe. Not so humorous to navigate.

Put on your woo-girl face though because this is a par-tay! Woo!

Bring out the mildly scandalous goodie bags filled with penis lollipops, dirty fortune cookies and flavored lube (i.e. the tame stuff). Just scandalous enough send your Great Aunt Esther into a conniption fit. Seriously, if this was the genuine highlight of this meal, it really does not speak highly of the hot garbage being slopped on a plate at Lucille's. Woo!

And we wait, and wait, and wait. 

Bread, finally! Woo!

Wait, are you sure you didn't confuse biscuits with hard tack? Because not even the scrumptious honey butter you've got is worth the dental bills incurred from teething this rock. 

Again we wait, and wait, and wait. 

Pulled pork! Woo!

Hold up. How does a pulled pork sandwich manage to be incredibly greasy and dry as a bone at the same time? Have I slipped into some alternative dimension? Is it opposite day? Because if so, this shit is finger-lickin' good. You best slop on that BBQ sauce to add some semblance of flavor to the sandwich and hope it doesn't soak through the bun in 2.5 seconds flat. Worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. Hands down. The garlicky mashed potatoes as a side were the only saving grace of the meal.

I seriously have no idea how this place stays in business. If it were not for the over abundance of low swingin' crotch fruit I brought to the party, dinner here would have tanked, hard and fast. It was awkward, drawn out (3 hours!) and ridiculously expensive. The best part about the experience was walking out the door. Woo!"}

I've never really liked the food all that much and I find it to be more of a hassle than it's often worth to go there and find parking and get a table. It's not always too busy, but most of the time it is. That's the price you pay when you're popular. 

The beer is good enough to be proud of if you're a local and you don't have to get it here since it's sold all over the valley. I wouldn't ever go out of my way to get it, but "good enough" is about the best compliment I can bestow. I'm not a huge fan of beer to begin with, but I like it enough to have an idea of what constitutes a good beer versus a bad or average one. Some of their beers I simply don't like - it's that stomach bile flavor that turns me away. Other brews are quite tolerable to actually good.

I see this mostly as a great place to take someone who is visiting from somewhere else. There's a bit of a 'wow' factor with Four Peaks. It's sorta neat to walk in through the back door past all the tanks and whatnot. In the summer, it's also a nice and chilly way to cool off. Beyond that, it's probably only barely worth it. I've found the service to be unpredictable... usually not good. It's probably a bad idea to take a date here unless you're in college. 

When my friends suggest going here, I usually suggest someplace else - not sure exactly why. There's just something about it that doesn't lend itself to an easy dining and drinking experience... it's complicated somehow. It's odd that a place you can wear flip flops to could feel complicated, but it is. Maybe it's that tiny bit of 'factory' vibe the building gives off. It's like we're visiting the building while it's working and we're not entirely welcome there, but it's just too polite to tell us to leave."}

With that out of the way, I really like this place. The service can be a little slow some days, but with those stairs, I can completely understand that. They do seafood right out here and I've only had better when I'm near a body of water. People who complain about seafood in AZ should stop and think about that for a second.

I admit that the smoke gets to me sometimes and it's annoying to stand through the door and wait for someone to wait on you. It seems like a crap shoot when someone will see you, but maybe I'm wrong and they have radios ready. 

Personally, I have really enjoyed their oysters, clam strips, fish and chips, etc. Hasn't made me sick and the prices for seafood isn't bad compared to the more upscale seafood places. 

If you're there for the food, go early. If you want drinks and maybe some food, go later."}

Sports on screens all around the cavernous place decorated with team flags hanging from high ceilings. Noisy in an energetic, college place way."}

Remy, our tour guide, gave us lots of fun facts and information on how to brew beer. He was friendly and I could tell that he had a lot of pride in the Four Peaks Brewery which is a positive thing and it says a lot about the company. I'm not usually a huge fan of beer so I wasn't able to enjoy the brews as much as others, but my favorite was the peach ale beer. 

I think a way that the tours can improve is if they give those who are doing the tour a designated area where we can sit down, relax, and enjoy our beers after the tour is over. After the tour was over, I didn't like how we had to go back to the front of the restaurant and wait for a table.. It was extremely crowded so we had to fight for a small spot at the bar before waiting 20 minutes to be seated with the rest of my group. We all ordered the beer flights which used up all the two drink tickets per person that they gave us for the tour. The beer flight is a good idea because of the variety. 

Their beer battered fries were EXCELLENT! My friends and I couldn't stop talking about how delicious and crispy they were.. I think i enjoyed the fries even more than the beer... haha."}

Sure you waited 25 minutes for a table when you see plenty open. But I had always chalked that up as one of those service industry niceties. 

Unfortunately stars aligned and I found myself in a shouting match with a doorman.  From what I know about doormen you want one thing. A guy who loses his temper and sends rational thought to the wind. Rather than refusing me service upon inspection of my perfectly valid drivers license with which I have been out happily drinking for 4 years and sending me on my merry way, my ID was held as a sort of ransom. Minutes flew as we argued there street-side. I  jumped through so many hoops trying to get my ID back I could have won a ribbon at the Eukenuba dog show. I recited my birthday, over and over. Yes maybe the tenth time I will slip. Or maybe I want my ID back to leave. I recited it so many times everyone in line knew my date of birth. I wrote down my address, phone number, date of birth. Still he was unsatisfied. 

It seemed to sink in that I was who I claimed when my accompanying party was able to tell him my address and my birthday. But this only further raised his suspicions. He stumbled on a thought of pure cunning, like Archimedes shouting in the street naked proclaiming his epiphany.

"Why would they all know where he lives?"

Yes, very fishy. By now it was clear. He believed it was an elaborate ruse. For what though? To infiltrate the mecca of gentrification? Or just to get a couple beers? And yes whenever I go out I make sure everyone know my address it's the only way I can get into any overrated restaurant.  It was easier to get through TSA when I came back from Mogadishu with a suitcase full of Qurans.

 By now he is flustered. He calls out again. 

"You didn't exactly make my job easier."

Yes, that is the role of a customer at a business that is in the service industry after all. Maybe I will wash dishes after I am done to save everyone from doing their job.

It took a manager to pry the ID from him and finally the refusal of service came. It was sort of like when you know someone is going to dump you so you spring into action to dump them first. 

The second star goes to the only thing they are able to get right. The beer."}

I still had the receipt and the bank statement which I was quite willing to show them in order to have the error corrected.  I spoke with one of the owners and she was so gracious.  Today I received a check in the mail to correct the error.  Ask me what I ate at Casey Moores.  Ask me how it tasted.  I couldn't tell you.

I mean, there were still a lot of people here...we were just lucky enough to snag a spot out front.

We were seated at a tall table on the patio, somewhat near a heater and ohmygosh, it was perfect outside. Our server was friendly and attentive, the food came out quickly, and I'm in love with their peach beer! Just like other Yelpers mentioned, the FRIES. They're really good, as was the Garden Burger which had melted pepperjack cheese, roasted red peppers, spinach, lettuce, and tomato. The sweet jalapeño sauce was too spicy for me on its own but tasted awesome on the burger. I like that you have to option to substitute the veggie burger patty in place of one of the other burger versions but lets be real - the Garden Burger has the best topping choices already.

Apparently their chicken tenders are amazing! The chicken egg rolls (umm, not sure what their official title is) weren't exactly what my sister was expecting and she'd probably order something different next time (this brings me back to the chicken tenders), but she still thought they were good and liked the jalapeño sauce and chipotle ranch to dip them in.

It was very busy, with a lot of the frat-house college crowd here for the game. We had a large party, and the person organizing our get-together tried to call an hour before we arrived to put our name on the list, but no one answered the phone after repeated attempts.  So, when we got here we waited for a bit outside while some tables cleared out.  When we finally got a table, they gave us a table that couldn't seat all of us, for they wrote down the wrong number of people for our party.  

After some more shuffling and rearranging of chairs and tables, we finally got seated.  I tried a sample of the pumpkin porter, and had the portabella-veggie beer bread.  The pumpkin porter was decent, and had a nice pumpkin-spice taste to it.  I wasn't a big fan of the veggie beer bread.  I was expecting more of a loaf-type bread instead of the flatbread that actually came out.  As a result, the dish was more of a wrap than a sandwich.  The interior of the wrap was filled with lots of fresh veggies, but I was hoping to find more portabella mushroom in it.  In addition, the veggies themselves were bland, and so overwhelmingly garlicky that I felt like I could ward vampires away for a mile with my breath.  

Despite having a large party, service, once we were seated, was good.  The waitress had no problem splitting our checks, and she refilled our drinks promptly as needed.

Another thing to note is that there isn't any A/C in the building, just overhead fans, so if you come on a hot day you might be sweating a bit!"}

Visited Four Peaks last night for Football Monday, A.K.A. Man Monday.  Literally spent like 6 hours at the bar.  It's the kind of place you can do that.  The food is above average for bar food... note, I said for bar food.  I'm admittedly a vodka and wine drinker, so my opinion holds little weight with beer.

Litterly full every single night of the week, the most amazing thing about this place is that the food is better than the beer. That isn't to say the beer isn't good, because some of it is great. Because it has become so large and so popular my only negative about this place is the fact that their seasonals and limited release list are so small and far apart. Then again they didn't become so popular by not having great beers. I'm a hop knot fan and if I'm at a restuarant that doesn't have a beer I haven't had or something I think is better it's my fall back favorite. All the beers are of great quality and while service can be slow at time (because of the massive amount of people there) it's absolutely worth the wait."}

And that they have bomb oysters and various plates of fried fishy goodness. So we had to check out this "staple" bar.

The atmosphere is casual and laid back. You can grab seating at the patio (recommended if the weather is bearable) or at the cozy wood-themed indoor bar. The place was quite empty, but we visited on a Wednesday night so that was expected.

The food was okay. Oysters were fresh but the flavor was a bit off. One of the oysters in our plate was spoiled and that ruined the plate for us. Luckily, the waiters were glad to replace it for us. The fried bar food selection includes fried mushrooms, fried oysters, and fish n chips, among others.  None of the plates were remarkable, except for the Oyster Rockefeller, which I highly recommend.

Wide selection of local beers on tap. And I hear this place is happening during happy hours.

Distinguishing factor: Warm and cozy bar with a lively local college scene and fresh selection of oysters and fried goodies."}

Brewery right? So, this means "bar food"? WRONG. The food is to die for. I get the Salmon BLT religiously, the BBQ Chicken Pizza is awesome, the Nachos are HUGE (add the blackened chicken and thank me later), and the specials are usually damn good also. 

I've probably been here 40 times (conservative number) and while the service can be lackluster, I cannot give them less than 5*. When I say the service is "iffy" it really depends on the server. Some are amazing. One guy I've had multiple times frankly does not give a $hit. And other times, they can just get overwhelmed (this place get packed wall-to-wall, so I can understand some lapses). 

The beers...AMAZING. If you want to get tipsy, go straight for the Raj IPA. A tasty, hoppy beer that will get the job done. I tend to like bitter beers like IPAs, so I stick to the Raj, HopKnot, and 8th Street. I do like Kiltlifter (probably their most popular beer) but it can start to get too sweet after a few. 

One thing many people fail to mention; order a glass of water. I know water doesn't sound impressive, but they pour the same distilled H20 they use in their beers and it is the best water in Arizona. Just a thought."}

They don't take reservations but they do accommodate large parties with minimal wait. 

Not only is the location huge, so are the portions... I had no idea. We started with an order of spicy Thai hummus with pita bread.  It was pretty tasty, the bread was soft and fresh and the hummus had a nice kick.  Other appetizers at the table where the spinach and artichoke dip, and the giant nachos.... Every appetizer was plenty for 3 to 4 people to share.  

For my entrée I went with the vegetable beer bread sandwich and fries.  The sandwich was okay, the bread was very thin and made into a wrap which I thought was interesting, but it got soggy fast so I ended up not eating the bread and just eating the vegetables out of the inside.  The fries on the other hand, beer battered and crispy...just the way I like them. 

I saw some pizzas floating around the restaurant too, next time I think that's definitely what I'm going to go for they looked amazing.

One of their bouncers, who refers to himself as "G", decided that it would be completely acceptable to let some transphobic words escape his mouth.  Now, in no way am I a transgender individual, but I do have much respect for the trans community and I can't believe this place would keep this dude around.  

So, my girlfriend had to use the restroom and there was a huge line, so she peeked around to see if there was the same traffic jam by the guys bathroom and this dude just comes at her all aggressive like telling her she needed to get away and all that...which she was quick to move and apologize.  But then she asked him, "What if I was a transgender person?" To which this guy replied "Well then you can get out."  Really dude?  So, she informs the manager of this and he was on her side for sure.  The bouncer then began harassing her again and was trying to kick her out of the bar (for what?! Right...he didn't say) and she called to the manager that he was still being aggressive with her.  The three of them went to have a talk and the bouncer was trying to say that she called him the "N" word...UM MY GIRLFRIEND IS BLACK TOO JACKASS!  She never uses that word and would NEVER call someone that because she actually is a respectable person and isn't ignorant.  Did the manager say anything to the bouncer about his transphobic comment??  Did he?! NO!! I later called to ask what the manager's name was, and found out that not only is Gavin a manager but he's also part owner...you've got to be kidding me.

It's a real shame when you let your employee harass a guest who didn't do anything but try to go pee.  Yelp folk, whether you're gay, straight, bi, queer, trans, a straight ally or something of the like, I strongly urge you to steer clear of this establishment and spend your money where this kind of behavior is not tolerated."}

For not liking the uni crowd...i had tons of fun this time!  Our server had the timing of a Swiss watch, up to the second accurate as to when the next round had to be ordered, and never skipped a beat!  I drank 10 London pubs worth of gin and tonics and had a happy buzz going.  I was kinda hoping that this crazy guy sitting with us was gonna start shit cuz I was feeling good and numb I could've gone a full 10 rounds with him, but I maintained and circulated instead.

I am giving Casey Moore's another star for our stellar server!  If the management reads this I hope that they believe in merit raises and employee rewards and utilize these incentives.

Being the adventurous one, ordered the fried pickles.. ya know you had to order at least once to say you tried them.. well, I wouldn't order those again.. let's just say I like my pickles firm! I ordered the trip tip salad for my lunch.. not much to say about it.. it was what it was.. overly sweet bbq ranch dressing with a few pieces of tri tip (was very tender) all covered in cubes of cheese. In fact none of us even ordered the ribs *sigh*. 

The service was super slow though food is priced well and the portions very large. Typical corporate experience not to good, not to bad just ho hum.. will probably not return. Prefer Joe's BBQ for the time being."}

So far, it has been the only consistently great bar I've found in Tempe, in part due to the fact that the crowd is so chill and not too clicky. It is true that it's predominantly ASU students, but a pretty wide spectrum of them, and it seems so laid-back I would think it would be hard for most to feel too out of place. I don't feel like I've walked into someone's private party at Casey's, and I very much appreciate that. 

I've also got to give props to the well-made drinks, decent beer selection, friendly bouncers, and a surprisingly good bar menu. I've had excellent sandwiches here on a couple of occassions.

Of course, Casey Moore's wouldn't be Casey Moore's if it wasn't for that fantastic huge patio that is a huge reason why bars out here can be so much for relaxing than in other climates. It doesn't matter how crowded it is or whether or not I can get a seat, I just love to walk around out there with my beer or martini, people watch (or fish watch), and lounge. No matter how crowded it gets though, the vibe stays easy and friendly, and in the winter hot and toasty as you (and sometimes some cool lizards) huddle around the heat lamps.  Always a good time."}

My wife ordered the shrimp scampi and for some reason it came out with a heavy cream sauce, no complaints because it was good but it was not scampi.  Tuna was perfect I had a chance to taste it  and that cooked perfect and I did notice a co- worker leave the 1/2 of the fish and chips on there plate no a good sign.  Clam chowder was good as a few friends did say they enjoyed it.  Calamari was off the chain "Perfect".  The server was warm,  friendly and polite and had some great suggestions for dinner and was very patient and waited for us to have  few rounds before we ordered dinner.  The place is pretty big and it seems that if you would come and sit in a different place each time it would be like going to a different place.  Music was jamming something for everyone. Folks were friendly and the place was packed.   

Now, cleanliness it  seems like it could use a wipe down, moping an a power wash in a few spots but I guess after a few cold ones you don't see it anymore.  Will I go back?  Yes, I would, affordable food, good music and  folks all in a good mood I'm there.

4 stars due to they are still a littler ruff around the edges.

The food is great.  I had chicken and pulled pork.  We also had the fried pickles which are excellent.  They do fried pickle spears here.  In other places I've only had pickle chips.

I didn't care for their regular unsweetened iced tea.  It had an odd/off flavor to it.

I'm a lightweight & even mixed drinks that have too many types of alcohol tend to drop me, but this one was PERFECT. Vodka, triple sec, strawberry lemonade & a splash of soda (I'm guessing Sprite). The first sip packed a little punch, but after that every drink tasted better than the last! I like that :D 

For appetizers our group ordered Fried Green Tomatoes & Fried Pickles to share, both were yummy!  

As a main dish I got a small plate of Gumbo with Cornbread. The cornbread had a cake texture, not my fav. The gumbo was good, nice texture, perfect amount and combination of meats (sausage, chicken, shrimp), but it was a bit on the salty side. It seems that to even out the saltiness they used pepper. I smelled it before I tasted, so it was quite a bit of pepper. I've pretty much spent the rest of the day trying to hydrate, lol! But it did clear my sinuses right up! I think I'll try something different next time :)

For months I had been looking forward to dining at this place, since laying eyes on an invitation to take place here. So, needless to say, after a doctor's appointment located a few blocks away, I jumped on the opportunity to eat some Oysters Rockafeller.

When I arrived, I thought the outer appearance of the establishment was quaint, quirky and certainly unique. The "casual" vibe screams out to you, as if anything other than flip flops and a tan are overdressing. 

Once I opened the doors, I found the inside to be completely dark and drab.... sort of like Cheers Neighborhood Bar's illegitimate cousin. The bartender looked up but failed to greet us because his current conversation was more important. We then seated ourselves and the hostess came by 2 minutes later only to say "You need some menus or something?" We of course said yes and she proceeded to retrieve them. 

The waiter was prompt and pretty pleasant. I was a little disappointed that after we ordered our drinks and food, we found out that happy hour was in a couple minutes. That would have been nice to know! 

I will say that we were thoroughly entertained by the patrons of the pub as we waited for our food. The bartender drank while on the clock and one guy continued to throw the F bomb and other four letter words. And to my surprise he let us know that women have vaginas and that he is currently receiving government cheese. I'm not sure why we all needed the lesson in anatomy and economics however, I didn't know whether to laugh or smack him.... lucky for him I didn't choose the latter. 

My husband's food was delivered to the table 10 minutes before mine which in and of itself was rude. However, this is not the final straw for me. 

THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE
I must say I was reluctant to use the restroom and for good reason. On my way to the restroom in the hallway was a pungent foul order which I assumed came from the men's room because 9 times out of 10, that is the case. When I opened the door to the ladies room I found the culprit. Naturally, I thought someone had let it fly in there, sadly I was sort of right. One stall had toilet paper all over the floor and seat so I went to the other and the sight will FOREVER haunt me. The toilet was not only filled with poo but some was smeared on the front. There is no way that all of that came from one person and if the "regular" culprit felt it was not necessary to flush, why should I for them? I held my water, washed my hands for fear of catching anything by way of touching knobs and hurried out of there only to find my Oysters Rockerfeller waiting for me at the table.... as if I wanted to eat after that site. 

The only reason this place even gets one star is because the waiter comped a beer from our tab... I think he felt bad for us. LOL 

My husband and I vowed to never return and I think I will take the advice of a previous commenter, Mark S. and try the House of Tricks down the road. So long Casey Moore's."}

It gives you that slightly dirty college feel. After I picked up a friend from the airport, we headed straight here and ate their oysters a dozen for $12 ($1/oyster). Its a pretty good deal considering at most places that's happy hour prices! Oysters are fresh and taste best with horse radish added on top! The only thing that would make this even better is making your own oyster sauce out of lemons, lime, sugar, etc. We also ordered their Fish sandwich which was titled the "Best in Town!". However, I thought it was just A-OK. I'd definitely come back for their oysters though! The ambiance is awesome. People wearing whatever they want and a very causal place. Their lights on the trees and on the open patio is a nice touch."}

I went there yesterday for the first and last time.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly, but was in that too friendly mode.  I don't know if you know what I am talking about, but it seemed like he was so overly friendly that it was insincere.  And he was one of those type of waiters who was there every 5 minutes at the start of the meal, and no where near at the end of the meal.

We started our meal with their signature biscuits.  We are in AZ so I am sure the cooks do not really now how to cook a good biscuit.  Our nice flakey biscuit was hard and crunchy on the outside, and warm and not flakey on the inside.  The honey butter was marginal.

The onion straw appetizer was good, the best part of the meal.

I had a baby back rib combo with hot links and my friend had the chicken and rib lunch combo.  Same kind of ribs.  The ribs were dry and not very tender.  She said her chicken was good, and my sausage was cooked fine.  No real flavor to the sausage, just spicy.

Overall, as BBQ joints go, I wont be back.  Its hard to create the hole in the wall BBQ joint with a chain, and Lucille's has not done it."}

I thought at the time that any drinking venue near ASU would be all the same - meatmarket bars full of interchangeable guys with too much gel in their hair and interchangeable girls with too much boob under their, uh, boobs. 

But Casey's was chill. Sure, I was older than everyone else probably by a decade or more, but it didn't matter. Everyone was hanging out at tables in the massive patio just enjoying time with their friends. No Usher's"Yeah" blasting out of the speakers for the 5 billionth time.

First off I love the atmosphere in this place. Such a cute, southern, home-like, relaxing feel. Mismatched lamps FTW!! There's plenty of room on the inside and various different areas to sit in, which makes it interesting each time you visit. 

I've never had slow or bad service here. The server my first time there not only was speedy and attentive but as I finished their version of an arnold palmer I was asked if I wanted to try a variation of it next. It was incredible. The food was also amazingly delicious. Their fried pickles are pretty authentic in my opinion. Our waitress this time was just as fantastic. She had a conversation with us, she was extremely knowledgeable and put up with our crazy table. 

The barbeque always good. I have had better luck with the garlic mashed potatoes than the mashed sweet potatoes. As far as drinks the Muddy Waters (non-alcoholic) is fantastic as is a drink I had today that actually involved a sweet tea vodka. Unbelievable.

The only downside to Lucille's is that since it's mainly barbeque it has a limited menu."}

My wife and I live next door and love strolling over for a relaxing dinner, drinks and great people watching.

When I head over with friends, the bartenders will support the cause provide us with some of the stiffest cocktails ever.  My advice is to call a taxi and have it waiting before you order a double.  I can stumble home.

Bottom line:  decent food and best chill bar in the Valley."}

I hope to provide some detailed information to help you get the best experience you can when coming to this neighborhood bar.

First off, there are beer specials every day. If a review states that the beer was $3.50 it was either on happy hour or was the beer of the day. Most of the beers on draft are regularly $4-$4.50. They also have a decent selection of bottled beers (and Boddington's in the can).

They have a board inside at the end of the main bar that has daily specials, this will usually consist of a higher dollar specialty item and desert along with a lower cost lunch type item. Just ask your server and they will give you the run down.

If you are in the mood for a very fast appetizer, the clams or shrimp will arrive in usually less than 5 minutes. Other apps come out as usual 10-15 minutes. Sandwiches and salads run about the same time depending on what needs to be cooked. I personally recommend the Hippy Sandwich with Blackened Chicken.

If you are looking for less of a crowd avoid Thursday-Saturday, as said before the bar is very popular and the weekend warriors come out in packs. Tuesday is a great day to come out, the special is Black and Tans but you can get either Bass or Guinness for $3.50 all day/night. 

A good place to park is the alleyway behind Buffalo Exchange or the parking lot to the east of it. If it's a busy night don't even try to get in the main parking lot.

Sunday's a bartender named Tyler works the outside bar and he makes a seriously spicy Bloody Mary. He also loves to high five, don't let him down.

Hope this info helps you have a good time at this great neighborhood spot, see you at the bar."}

Casey Moore's is easily one of the best - if not most beloved - bars in the Phoenix area, hands down. I've now been going to the downtown Tempe classic for nearly 10-plus years on a routine basis. The food is okay, sure, but it's the atmosphere and clientele that makes the place so charismatic and inviting. Whether for a low-key evening, a bender, or a quintessential day-drinking getaway, Casey Moore's usually fits the bill. Even on busy nights the service is friendly and personable. The inside is dark and cushy, but it's the spacious, wrap-around outdoor patio area is what seals the deal for me. It's practically peaceful. Greenery and brick everywhere, the place oozes with un-Phoenix like character.

Though the crowd at Casey Moore's is often just as image-conscious (respectively and respectfully), it's never as obvious or boorish as say, a lounge in downtown Scottsdale. From low-key urban hipsters and college intellectuals, to artists, writers, and musicians, the vibe is always unpretentious and welcoming.

And yes, because of Casey's crowds, their parking lot is usually packed. However, with the amount of street parking allowed in the immediate area around it, it's actually not a headache at all."}

Food: everything we ordered was amazing. Finger licking good. Started with the burnt end pieces (can't remember the name but it's from the appetizers) and it was so so so good. Also got the friend okra which was also delicious. I ordered the blackened catfish with mashed potatoes and veggies and I loved it. It was blackened perfectly! I had them out the sauce in the side in case I didn't care for it. My bf ordered the backyard favorite (not sure if that was the exact name) which came with ribs, chicken and some other meat. I tasted all three and they were awesome!! 
I don't think you can go wrong with any of the items on their menu. Would love to go back especially since it is too hot here to BBQ yourself."}

Most of my friends stayed home and went to ASU (eventually after going the junior college route). Luckily I graduated in 4 years. Most of my friends did the 5 year plan so when I moved back after graduation it was like I had another year socially (which was interesting with the whole job thing, and all). Anyway, during that "social" year I spent a LOT of time at Casey Moore's and really liked it. I continued to go every now and then over the years, but it seemed like as we got older (and the crowd here stayed younger) we just kind of stopped going. 

I went to a show at Gammage recently w/my mom and I randomly suggested we come here for happy hour beforehand since it's close by. We both loved it (she got a real kick out of having to show her ID when we walked in)! It pretty much looked the same as I remember it. Most of the seating is on the large patio. There's a bar on what I would consider the back of Casey Moore's surrounded by wooden booths and a coy pond. There's plenty of additional outdoor seating near the front of the restaurant. The inside isn't huge. There's a couple of smaller dining rooms and of course, a bar. 

I sat inside with my mom (luckily there was a table available). Honestly, in all my years coming here I don't remember having food (I probably did at some point). We ordered a half dozen oysters, fried calamari & escargot. Everything was delicious! I loved the butter sauce the escargot came in & the calamari portion was HUGE. During HH all apps are $2 off. I ordered a couple beers and I believe they're a $1 off during HH.

Service was friendly. This is a fun place to come to with a group. Honestly, even though Casey Moore's is close to ASU since it's a little off Mill Ave. I think it attracts some Tempe locals (not just students) so it's a fun mix of people. 

I'll be back."}

This hipster haven not only offers the perfect cool, aesthetically-pleasing and relaxing environment, but they also serve tasty food and awesome drinks. Service is also standard, though sometimes I do get extra friendly and attentive servers.

My favorites about this place are the green twinkle starry lights in the trees, fried zucchini, clams chowder, and drinks. 
 
In short, I only have great things to say about this place. The one reason I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because there's a lot of smoking going on during my dining/drinking experience. But then again, I guess it won't be a hipster haven after all, if it's not smoking-friendly. So be prepared to do tons of secondhand smoking if you like me - a non-smoker who can seriously care less for cigarettes smoke. 

Nonetheless, it definitely worth a try!"}

We liked that it was slightly outside the main area of Tempe and more in a residential district.  The surrounding houses have some nice character. I had some oysters as an appetizer and the 18 Jumbo Shrimp for my meal.  Both were great.

Drinks - I had a nice white wine I cannot remember the name of, but it did the job.
Food - I had maybe two bites due to chatting with my pals, but ended up leaving the leftovers on the table since it didn't really do much for me. Maybe I order poorly, but my pasta was lame.
Service - Waitress with an attitude and waiter that walked around with an aloof expression on his face. Neither were very attentive to our group of 13+.
Ambiance - I'm confused... We're in Tempe... a land-locked state, correct? Oysters? At an Irish pub? Really? Like I said, confusing!"}

I chose a hot turkey open faced sandwich with stuffing and mashed potatoes, and gravy. I asked for the gravy on the side. When they brought it to the table, I could tell it was not going to be great. The gravy was extremely thick, like custard. I put a spoonful on top of my turkey, and it sat there in a lump on top of it. I tried to spread it around on top, and gave up.  The turkey was room temperature, on top of a slice of plain white bread and a large pile of stuffing. It looked like it was all dried out, and I could hardly swallow it. The potatoes had a lot of garlic in them, and that didn't go very well with the stuffing. I asked if I could try a different gravy. They brought a brown gravy, and it had some kind of herb in it. It tasted terrible to me. 
I have a rule that I only order what the restaurant is famous for. I should have ordered BBQ."}

Daily specials: 
Monday - Newcastle 
Tuesday - Black and Tan (Guinness and Bass, either together or separately) 
Wednesday - Stella Artois 
Thursday - Four Peaks Kiltlifter 
Friday - Smithwicks 
Saturday - Fat Tire 
Sunday - Sierra Nevada 

There are five total televisions; four in the main bar (two LCD big screens) and one small TV at the back bar. Sports is usually a safe bet, assuming there is something worthwhile/local to watch. If it's slow and nothing is interesting, ask for a channel change. Wait a minute, why are you here watching random things on TV? 

The dining rooms ARE handicap accessible, you will need to speak to a staff member to have them open the back door and then go around the south side of the building to access the ramp. Handicap bathrooms are also available, again ask a staff member. 

The main bar has a "classic" dartboard and a chalkboard to keep score. Ask the bartender for the darts."}

The bar is nice, right off of Mill Ave/University but a bit tucked away from the Mill crowd.  You will definitely get a unique people watching experience, as the crowd is diverse from college co-eds, to hipsters to punk...you get my point.

The alcohol selection is great, my fave being Ace Pear Cider, they also have Stella Artois, which I have found to be quite difficult to find on tap in other locations.

Added bonus, men get to use the "stone" outside restroom, where you pee, well on a stone outside. Kinda jealous considering there is always a wait for the 2 stall women's bathroom.

This place is always crowded, on this occasion I went on a Wednesday night and it was packed.  Service is always good and friendly, though they could afford to hire more people as the wait for drinks when being served is usually long.  It beats going up to the bar inside though, as that wait is usually just as long.

The parking is a mess, as the lot is small and well, it's always crowded.  Be wary of parking in nearby apartments, as your car will be towed."}

On recent visits since my last review you will realize we are creatures of habit on our food choices. I'm a oyster lover any which way, the regular soups are always good  and when they have Italian Wedding soup, it's delish. Burgers are fantastic, even if you opt for a Chicken Burger, still good. The Salads are excellent too, the Taco Salad, Cesar Salad with Salmon and or either Blacken Chicken or Shrimp added. I've also recently tried the Hippy Sandwich which I loved. Beers are always cold, drinks are always made perfectly.

You just gotta Love this place!"}

Casey's is supposed to be haunted as the bar is actually an old house that was built in 1910.  I've never had any spooky experiences, but that's the word on the street anyhow."}

I called ahead and made a reservation for my family, letting them know it was a special occasion and that I'd be bringing my whole family, kids included.  They said it was no problem and that with her ID she could order her first legal drink at dinner that night.

We showed up and the place was packed to the gills due to the 'Tour de Fat' being the same night in Tempe.  We finally found parking and my family and I weaved through the crowd to find the entrance where the bouncer was checking IDs at the gate.  Now I understand his job, but I had reservations in the restaurant for the whole family and it was a bit of mess explaining to him that we were ALL going to dinner and we all didn't come prepared to produce IDs, including my 10 year old son who was with me.  He eventually understood and let us by so we could get to dinner.

Inside everything else went much more smoothly.  All of our dishes were fine.  And as a birthday gift the manager bought my daughter her first drink on the house, which I thought was really sweet.   They allowed me to bring in my own cake without an upcharge, and lent me a sharp knife to cut it and plates to serve it, we had a really nice time for her birthday!

tl/dr  This is a great place to celebrate a special event like a 21st birthday!"}

The food was ok, not great and I thought the entrees were a bit pricey.  All in all it was ok, until we went to pay the check.  We were a large group and paid with cash and a credit card.  When we got the bill to sign, we realized he did not apply the full $100 in cash that we gave along with the credit card.  When we questioned the waiter, he got very defensive and pulled $40 out of his POCKET and said we only gave $40.  WTH? Why is it in his pocket and not the register??  We were adamant that we gave $100, he went inside and came back 10 min later with his Manager and apologized for the mix up.  The waiter said someone found it on the floor, while the Mgr said another waiter found it in the bill folder.  So which is it?  We thought we had the bill squared away until we checked our credit card online and we were charged the full amount 2x and now they won't provide a credit.  This really soured our experience, I've never seen anything like this before.  The food was ok but after this business with the check, I don't think we can go back.

Moved to Phoenix from Seattle for school and this was the only place I felt I could really kick back and relax. Reminded me of a few of my favorite spots back home on The Hill.

Pros:

-Yummy Seafood selection.

-Plenty of choices for people of all food preferences- meat lovers, pescatarians, vegans, etc.
I'd recommend the Caim Chowder, the Hippie Sandwich (YUM!), and the Hummus platter is a great share along with the Calamari. In Arizona good quality Calamari has proved to be hard to come by, but not here!

- My favorite characteristic about this place is the resident kitty that you can find lounging around no matter the size of the crowd :)

- One of the most diverse crowds of people i've seen at one place in Arizona.

- Friendly people and staff; if ever a busy night people will gladly share a table with you. Always made a new friend :)

Cons:

-Staff can be a bit impatient with placing orders and at times I've had to go up to the bar from my table to order drinks because the waiter didn't come by and check up for over 20mins...

Other than that, its a great place to go if you want to meet some kick ass people and avoid the drama of mill and sky rocket prices of old town."}

Oh, and I'm tired of everyone on this site calling it apple butter.  Anyone from the south knows what apple butter is, and this is not apple butter.    What they give you is butter with cinnamon and sugar in it, NOT apple butter (so don't go here expecting apple butter)."}

I love the oysters and we mostly came here to enjoy the day with some appetizers and enjoy some beverages. We ate outside, which was beautiful. They had a koi pond with a tiny waterfall.

I just recommend eating inside or spritz yourself with a bottle of bug spray."}

If your visiting the city or for some reason live here but have never been you really do need to check it out. Hipster joint for sure haha but even if your not one your self its still a good time. You will find a busy crowd every day of the week . but most the time its a good busy where you can mingle and meet some new friends. It has amazing food. Decent drink prices esp for being so close to mill ave. And some of the best ambiance in the city with it being an old converted house. Best patio in Tempe for sure."}

Tucked a few feet away from the chaos of Mill Ave, it's a perfect place for delicious food and solid drinks. Almost always crowded, the old historic home is full of character and is perfect for people watching. The place is mainly patio, with a small amount of indoor seating as well. 

The staff is friendly and the location is perfect if you're looking for something different. Don't miss the chance to head upstairs and check out why Casey's is rumored to be haunted. I've heard about 100 varying versions of the story, but it's the small quirks like this that really make Casey's a local standout."}

The oysters on the half shell were exceptional, especially with the house-made fresh (and potent!) horseradish. Kinda wakes up your sinuses and makes you say "Boy... Howdy!" This is Japanese wasabi's American cousin driving a monster truck through your uvula!

However, there were some misses with the food on the rest of our order. The chipotle hot wings were way too subdued, although the texture was decent. I was hoping for a spicy wing that would grab me by the gooch--alas, these did not. The fried mushrooms were a tragedy. Crispy and breaded on the outside, but when you bit into them they turned to mush.

I'd come back for the beer, the interesting crowd, the great outdoor patio or rustic bar interior. I'm advising you order carefully though. Maybe their sandwiches are the big draw (besides the face-smacking, face-hugging oysters)."}

Casey's is mostly outdoor patio with a small indoor area with a bar and some tables and (of course) restrooms. Much of the patio is shaded and they turn on the water misters in the summer to help cool things down.  In the winter when it gets chilly, they have plenty of heat lamps to warm it up a bit.

When they get busy on weekend nights, you may be searching for a table for a while and you may not get your drinks/food as quickly as you would like.  Be patient!  It is worth the wait.  

Bathrooms are clean and well kept, as is everything else.  You will not see leftover plates of food laying around on tables or trash on the floor/ground.  Everyone does a really great job of keeping things tidy.  

Four stars because I think they could hire a couple more servers for busy times so that no one is overwhelmed with too many tables.  Other than that, this is my regular watering hole and will continue to be as long as I'm living in the Phoenix area!"}

I really don't know what they see in the place other than "hey we've been going here every week for the better part of 10 years now...why would we do anything else?"

Pros: It's uh. It's a bar? With an outdoor bathroom that lets you pee on the wall? I dunno. I digress. There are some good parts.

1. Management and Bartenders: Awesome folks. Very personable. If you have any issue with the place at all, the manager will do his best to make sure you're happy, even if there's not much he can do. 

2. Aside from the people who drink here(which I'll touch on below), the actual physical atmosphere is nice. I like patio bars.

Cons:

1. Door staff are assholes. This is the first place I've ever had a security person anywhere ever lay their hands on me. I walked out the side entrance to make a phone call in a quieter area and told the guy I'd be right back in. Finished my very short phone call within eyesight of the guy making eye contact with him a few times during the call. I walked back into the bar past him. He followed me 50 feet into the bar and grabbed me by the back of my neck and started screaming at me about showing ID every time you walk into the place. I literally talked to the guy not 5 minutes before in order to avoid having to go through the ID process all over again. If it ever happens again I'm calling the police and filing a battery charge. 

2. Food is garbage. With the exception of the potato skins, everything on the menu sucks. But it's REALLY hard to make lousy potato skins.

3. Beer menu is small/not really listed anywhere. Ask the waitress which beers they have and she'll tell you a few random ones that she can think of off of the top of her head and say "and we have others I guess". If you want Kiltlifter or Fat Tire, you're set. If you want anything else, it's a 50/50 shot on whether or not they have it.

4. Hipster. Central. Seriously the clientele here is atrocious. I've literally been verbally assaulted here for eating potato skins by a waifish, meth-mouthed denizen who was the human embodiment of the lyrics of Macklemore's "Thrift Shop" because there was cheese and bacon on my food. He went off on me for being offensive to animals or some such. Telling me I would be a vegetarian if I had to kill the animal myself. On a friday night, the place is packed wall-to-wall with the whiniest, heroin-chic douchebags you will ever meet. I feel like this is the case because they don't like the loud music of the bars on mill so they walk around the corner and park themselves at Casey's.

5. Cops. Lots and lots and lots of cops. If you go here on a semi-regular basis(once or twice a month or more) for a long enough period of time, you WILL be stopped immediately after leaving the bar. The Tempe PD are for the most part nice folks, but the ones who patrol looking to catch a DUI coming out of Casey's are all assholes. Not really the bar's fault at all, but it's part of the experience of going there.

6. Pricing. Two drinks and a plate of aforementioned potato skins? 20 dollars plus tip. Look to spend at least 5 dollars(tip included) for a pint of beer here unless it's on special/happy hour. 7 to 10 dollars for a mixed drink with well liquor(tip included). 

7. Parking. 10-15 parking spots in their lot. Yeah. 10 to 15 spots. For a bar that is usually packed to the brim with people. After the stores close down, you can park in the little strip mall parking lot around the corner. But again, there's always a cop car or motorcycle cop just sitting in that lot waiting for you to look like you're walking toward a car. 

8. Wait staff sucks. It's always sucked. It's not really their attitude all the time(though it is sometimes). They hire like 3 or 4 girls(I'm not being sexist, they only hire females to do wait staff) to cover what's usually close to 1,000 people(maybe more? I'm not a good judge of actual numbers of people) all asking for booze at the same time. Don't even bother placing drink orders with them. Just walk up to the bar and pay with cash and then go back to your seat.  

9. Bathrooms are horrendous. It's really hard to use the bathroom when there are 2 urinals and one stall for guys. Especially once 10pm rolls around and the holocaust-skinny hipster kids I mentioned above start vomiting in the stall and sink because they can't hold their booze and drinking in a college town means DRINK UNTIL YOU DIE. The blarney stone is all well and good until a dude takes a dump in there. 

10. Climate control. Because of the patio setup, it's always too hot or too cold to be really comfortable, save for the few months per year here in the valley that the weather is really nice. It's still 90+ degrees at 11pm here 6 months out of the year. 

If you haven't been here? Don't bother going. You'll get suckered into meeting your friends for drinks for the next 6 years."}

The side of fries (shoestring) potatoes was not hot at all, barely warm but just OK.

I probably would try this again to see if I had a better experience.
Service was SLOW, but good.

We started off with an order of fried pickles. Different than your Hooters variety, but good nonetheless. The biscuits were meh, a little too dry for me, even with the apple butter. I had to choose between a messy tri tip sandwich, or what I thought would be the less messy bbq chicken sandwich (I don't know why I didn't think all of the food would be messy). I settled on the bbq chicken sandwich and it was pretty huge when it arrived. I got it with fries as a side. 

I really wanted to try the red velvet, but alas, next time. I give Lucille's 4-stars because I think it has promise for the next time I visit and have some "real" bbq."}

I adore this joint as both a bar and a restaurant. It has the best patio in all of Tempe, nay all of Phoenix, no--history. Alright, probably not history. I mean, if there were a bar in the middle of some wicked beautiful natural reserve, I'm sure it would trump Casey's. But I'm not qualifying their worth based on beauty. (Sorry, dearest. I'll make sure to spend freely this weekend to make up for that slight.) The five stars it gets is based on the general relaxing vibe it exudes.

It's far enough off the Mill Avenue strip that the douchebaggery of those bars rarely flows over into Casey's. I've seen that the only gripe most people have with this bar is the occasional frat boy that wanders onto the patio, but even though these specimens in their natural environment are prone to swinging their dicks and strutting with impunity, they act different once they're surrounded by the regular clientele. The regulars could care less that you're the beer pong champion or top sorority sex kitten, can you engage in a meaningful conversation? No? Then kindly take your bulging biceps and stilettos to Scottsdale, where you're sure to be appreciated.

I love the fact that this bar attracts such a broad range of people, all of whom coexist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and happy drunkenness. The elderly come here for the oysters, the hipsters come here to show off their newest tattoo. ASU professors coexist with high school dropouts. Professional bar hoppers chit chat with weekend warriors. The food's pretty wicked as well. 

French onion soup, the Hippie Sandwich, the Tuna Bacon Melt, the Fishwich (without bread it just becomes fish and chips, but way cheaper), the Oysters Rockefeller, the Chipotle Chicken Wings, the Clamstrip basket at 5 bucks a pop...it's greasy and divine. The prices aren't absurd, but are a little on the steep side for bar food, but it's totally worth it. And if you go for happy hour, there are free munchies inside near the dart board.

It's a lovely little pub with a great patio, friendly servers and decent drink prices. Go there often enough and I'm sure its subtle charm will capture your fancy (and your wallet), just as it has countless others.

Dearest Casey Moore, you hold a place in my heart and although my liver denies it, she thinks you're pretty cool too."}

As a place to go drinking with friends-4 stars.  Great atmosphere, diverse crowd, good stuff on tap (my favorite is the Four Peaks Scottish Amber), great outdoor seating area.

For dining they get 3 stars.  It has been several months since I left New England and Casey Moore's is my first venture out for seafood, albeit with diminished expectations.  That being said, my Fish & Chips ($11.00, Cod, not the Haddock overhanging the plate I had grown accustomed to) was pretty good.  The fish was lightly battered and done just right-moist, tender, soft and juicy.  The chips were skin -on fries.

My wife had Salmon Oscar.  The salmon was slightly overdone, and the crab and hollandaise sauce was a little too fishy.  She ordered a double cooked baked potato that looked and tasted exactly like the prefab twice baked potato's that came with some Omaha Steaks I received from my boss last Christmas.  There were also slices of zucchini and yellow squash which were sauteed with mild seasoning.

The waitress was outstanding and gave us unbiased recommendations such as: "I would stay away from the Surf & Turf.  We just don't go through enough lobster and the kitchen doesn't always do a great job with it.  It gets sent back sometimes."  Good to know.  She also recommended the Salt Cellar for great Fish & Chips. 

Overall, I would give them 3 stars and I would return for Fish & Chips and drinking."}

But it seems like a happening place so that's a plus. Food wise, it's ok. I see it as pretty much bar food they fry up in the back although they do have sandwiches and raw oysters.

I would probably say come here in the day for food. At night, you come for the drinks and to look cool."}

Located right in Tempe Marketplace, it's a huge restaurant, we different themed dining areas. They are great for large groups. 

Service here each time has been friendly. Our beverages (in HUGE mason jars) and food (huge portions), all brought to us within good time frames... 

You get complimentary biscuits that come warm in a basket with their Apple butter, a good way to start! 

Last night, I ordered one of their platters (chicken + 2 other meats + 2 sides). The chicken and brisket was tender, no knife needed. But the tri tip ends were just a bit tough in comparison, so I didn't eat much of that.... Corn was standard... I also got their peanut slaw, it was a greasy because of its oil/vinegar base. I wasn't a huge fan, but it's all in preference. Their cornbread with lots of honey and butter though, yummy! I tried a piece of their baby back ribs off my husband's plate, pretty good too... Everything was lathered in BBQ sauce. And like said earlier, huge portions, between hubby and I, we probably took home 5 lbs worth of leftovers! 

So in conclusion, maybe not the highest quality BBQ, but this place is a fun spot to eat at. Food and ambience is good. You can also walk around after, which is what we have been doing... 

I also have to mention the huge basket of tootsie pops at the take out counter in the front, cute!... And the fact that we were given warm wet hand towels after our meal.. Nice details!...

Ps, I see a lot of reviews complaining that this place is too expensive... I guess coming from out of town where this is the normal price range, I didn't really notice! And also, for the third time, portions of enormous!"}

 I read so much about Casey Moore's on Yelp that I asked my bro about it, so we headed over there this past weekend night. I couldn't believe how HUGE it was! Or how I didn't know about it on my previous visits to Buffalo Exchange and the general college area-us East Coasters aren't used to parking lots I guess...? But anyway, the bouncers were nice, and I couldn't believe how much we kept walking around outside. There were all kinds of seating arrangements to bascially accomidate any kind of group-from tables with umbrellas, to benches, to regular four person tables, to chairs arranged in a circle to even ladies lounging on these kind of upraised curb thingies, I was impressed with the variety. I felt I had stumbled onto a crazy backyard house party! The crowd was def. younger, but the huge groups of guys were polite when they bumped against you (your clue that this place is PACKED). Although there was tons of seating, there still weren't really any seats. We went in for the beers, but I saw another secret door at the bar and two guys walk in so my bar scene spidey sense went off and behold-two chairs at a table open! I gestured to my bro and snagged it, and lit up a horrible vice and people watched on the porch. It is def. a scene here, but it is pretty relaxed-I def. agree with that. He got me a guiness, which was fine (one gets spoiled by the countless irish pubs in Boston), and then the porch filled up. It is a little difficult to catch bartenders attention since the bar can go three people deep wanting drinks! I want to try the food, but the prices are def. steeper than I am used to...so I will have to let go of my east coast cheap oysters, I guess! But still looking forward to frequenting here repeatedly, trying the food and brining my out of state friends here to relax.

6,730th Impression:

One cannot have "just a beer, I guess, couldn't hurt" at Casey Moore's. This has become such a main stay in my life, as it does everyone else that loves it. Where else can you feel relaxed reading a book with a beer, running into your boss or cruising around all hot and sauced lookin' for hotties to seduce with slurred dictation? You can even bring your MOM here in the afternoons and eat their delish avocado and shrimp salad (may be one of the most perfect salads on earth). It really does feel like a permenant house party where you can strike up a conversation with anyone. I have to admit that on St. Pattys day I came here and shamefully peed on the Blarney Stone while guys stood guarded-it was like a rite of passage. Oh Caseys...I might even visit you tonight!"}

The ambience is nice. Historic haunted house a few steps away from Mill.  I've only been here on weekends, and it's especially hard to get seats when ASU is in session.  Parking also can be difficult.  The food has always been OK.  They do have non-seafood items for people like me.  Service can be spotty.  My last visit, however, really changed my perspective on this place.  I would have rated this place 3 stars, but they failed in a couple of key areas.  It took over one and a half HOURS for us to get our entrees.  We did get appetizers and soup/salad for those who ordered them, but the gap between those and the entrees was noticeably long.  I understood that since we were a somewhat large party that it may take longer but still, that long?  I was starting to wonder if they just wanted us to keep the alcohol flowing and that we wouldn't notice how long the actual food took.  When I finally got my turkey croissant sandwich, there was very little turkey, as in 2 thin slices, and I couldn't detect the avocado, lettuce, or tomato.  I could definitely taste the bacon, though, since there seemed to be more bacon than anything else.  The balance of the whole sandwich was lost.  Everyone else was happy with their food.  At least the servers acknowledged at the end that it took a while and comped a few items.  Since it was a large party, they included the 18% tip in the bill despite the somewhat crappy service.  Since people were more interested in the movie afterwards, I wasn't going to contest that.  I'll reluctantly come here again which is why I rate it two stars.  Luckily, this isn't a place near the top of my friends' go-to list.  And I will try to talk people out of this place if it comes up."}

Our waitress was monotone when talking to us, she asked us if we had been there before and said "welcome back" so depressing. When we had questions about the menu answers were short and the service, especially when most people are in a hurry at lunch time, it was really slow here so it prevented us from wanting to get items we would have normally ordered or wanted to. I just ended up getting the spinach dip and it was swimming in oil. Tried pouring some out but it kept accumulating, I could t even finish it and my fingers felt so greasy after every chip. Love their apple butter, sweet tea, and beef ribs and generally having dinner here goes well, service has always been pretty slow since I first came here, still is, but lunch the other day they were not at their best all the way around, more disappointed in the food quality than anything."}

The iced tea and strawberry limeade are pretty great, too.

Setting is nice, and I do like the service. Friendly people, even on crowded peak times. One time, I was asking a server his opinion between two items on the menu.

We ate at Lucille's last week for a late dinner, and everything tasted good, however, my 2 year old ended up with a slight case of food poisoning. She was up the entire night throwing up after we got home from dinner. I had found 2 hairs (after finding the 2nd hair UNDER my food, I came to the conclusion that they were not mine) on my plate and within my burger. I was only a two bites away from finishing my food when I made the realization that the hairs did not belong to me so I was mostly embarrassed that I ate the whole thing, luckily, I did not end up sick like my daughter. It seems that their kitchen may not be managed very well, or maybe it's just that it was 9pm and they didn't care. We had to take to my toddler to urgent care because she threw up well into the next day. So of course, there were co-pay fees and prescriptions we had to pay for. I wrote to Lucille's that very same day that we took her to urgent care which was 12/14 and still have not received any sort of acknowledgement from them. Also, I posted on their Facebook page and the same thing, no response. I guess it's the same upkeep of their kitchen, THEY DON'T CARE!"}

It was Thursday night in which they have a special on Kiltlifter (sp?) and I was pretty excited.  The music was not that good.  I wish that they would have a DJ there on busy THursday nights.  That would really enhance the atmosphere and probably their people traffic as well.

To be fair, Shula's is a fine dining restaurant and Casey Moore's is an Oyster House. You pay a premium for the ambiance and the aged beef. To be honest, the food is far better at Casey Moore's. I don't remember the wine choice but the retail of both wines were around the same. Just more than twice the price per glass."}

I came here on 10/14/14 and got the Quarter pound chicken lunch special with brisket burnt ends. My boyfriend got the regular brisket plate with macaroni and fries. We also got half order of friend pickles as an appetizer (best ones yet)

The chicken was amazing, nice smokey flavor and juicy! Brisket burnt ends were good no complaints here. My boyfriends brisket were good but the macaroni was average nothing too special; fries were the worst, it was skinny like straw fries and super stale! I thought I had picked up a bad one but they were like fries that had been left out for too long. 

This place is also a little pricey but you pay for what you get. Our total bill came out to 40$. I would probably choose this place over Famous Dave's the BBQ restaurant chain.  

BTW, the free biscuits are to die for with cinnamon sugar butter!"}

If you are new to BBQ you will find it okay. We went for lunch on a Saturday only to find that you CAN'T get lunch on a Saturday, only dinner. We were interested in a sampler platter. They are almost double the lunch price on the dinner menu. When I asked the waitress about the lunch menu she said "not on the weekend". I told her that I didn't plan on spending $30 for a lunch plate and she just shrugged her shoulders and smiled - very rude. The biscuits she brought were hard. We switched to sandwiches due to the high cost of things on the dinner menu. The bun was very thick and hard and I kept tearing pieces off to avoid a mouth full of bread. The cole slaw was very dry and had no flavor at all. My husband said the BBQ beans were very spicy and he likes spicy food so they must've been really spicy. Also there were only 3 types of BBQ sauces to choose from. Most BBQ paces have a greater variety of sauces. Overall the place did NOT live up to its smell. I don't understand all the people waiting to get in there. I suggest Honey Bears BBQ. It's not far away, has zero atmosphere but GREAT BBQ at a reasonable price."}

We got there a little after 5 and it was busy but still got a table (booth).  Parking is always a bit hairy down there but after circling the lot a few times a few spots opened up.  We had a bunch of oysters and were extremely happy.  I haven't had good oysters in AZ so I was very happy to taste freshness and get real horseradish to put on them.  We ordered a couple more apps and took full advantage of the happy hour $2 off apps.  We do like fried pickles but these ones are spears and we both prefer the fried pickle wheels.

Now the reasons you may want to reconsider:

-- Extreme Portions.  This may be a good thing for some, but I found myself feeling very wasteful about half-way through the meal.  There was simply no way I was going to finish, and since I was planning to walk around the Marketplace afterwords - I knew the food wouldn't keep.

-- Extreme Prices.  We dropped in with the kids, because we thought it would be family friendly and moderately priced.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu.  All the entree's were $20+  Even kids meals were $8 dollars... better mortgage the house if you want to get drinks too!

-- Better Options.  Yes, this place is great.  But for the price, I could find comparable spots to eat.  The main advantage to Lucille's is that it is barbecue in the right location (Tempe Marketplace)."}

Being in town for work I sometimes eat alone and sit at the bar...the real mark of a top notch establishment is a good bar staff. This place has it for sure. They were quick to get drinks, got my food orders spot on, and were fun to talk to. It was especially hilarious when some foreign students came in (I believe french) and began to hit on one of the regulars. Considering how drunk they already were they got cut off after one drink...and of course left shortly after. 

The restaurant is a bit off on a side street in what looks like a converted over house...so it has a very relaxed and cozy feel. They also have a huge outdoor patio area. On top of the amazing oysters I had I also had a tuna melt sandwich. It was very good, but was open faced...I expected two slices of bread to make it into a full sandwich. Not a big deal but a little odd."}

Tried the lunch two meat platter with baby back ribs and tri tip and cheesy grits as a side.  Meat was extremely tender, great smoked favor and the bbq sauce and the mop sauce were really good. Loved the cheesy grits! Biscuits were great too.

Went back  Saturday for lunch and was disappointed to find no lunch specials on the weekend. Due to the price of two items at regular pricing I chose only the baby back ribs. For sides I chose potato salad  and the honey peanut slaw. Potato salad was o.k., but the peanut  slaw was great! It's a vinegar based slaw and reminds me of an Asian type slaw with a little sweet and a little sour.

I've had a lot of BBQ around the states and this is one of my favorites.

For the fellas, if you gotta take a leak and don't want to go all the way into the bar to hit the bathroom, you can just go to the Blarney Stone (that is tucked in away from the partons dining on oysters) and release.

The food is tasty and comparably priced to other dive bars in the area - not cheap, but fair quality. Casey Moore's does include an appetizer discount during their happy hour which saves you a couple bucks. Honestly if you're coming just for drinks, an appetizer plate will do a fine job as an add-on since they're really entrees in my eyes. 

Speaking of drinks, there are plenty of standards as well as microbrews on tap. The service on refills is speedy too. As a bonus, if you're like me and can't have gluten (or if you're not a beer person), Casey Moore's offers Angry Orchard hard cider on tap.

Casey's is my favorite place. Definitely put it on your list if you'd like to avoid the typical Mill Avenue crowd."}

I think their food is great!  To be honest, their type of barbecue doesn't float my boat, it's a spicy dry rub, but all of the guys in the group enjoy it!

My favorite food on the menu is the garden burger with fresh roasted veggies.  I've also enjoyed the mac and cheese, sliders, salads and more.  I also really like the fried green tomatoes.  I don't know where you can get those in Arizona.

The servers are usually a little slow, every time.  I''ve been served someone else's drink when asked for a refill.  (I had diet coke, they gave me someone else's iced tea.)  It takes them several mentions to get drinks or turn down the music.  I don't think our group is that big, only 12, but these guys usually can't get the hang of it.

Other than that though, it's good, clean and enjoyable food!"}

It has a great lively atmosphere.  My friend's uncle was playing live blues for the night!   We had a very large group so I am also posting the review for my meat eating friends also because there weren't many veggie options available besides sides.

My favorite thing here were the biscuits.  They were addictive! The Dixie Sweet Tea was good!  I did not like the Flame Roasted Artichoke app.  It was really dry and had no seasoning.  I expected it to be meatier (like the way artichoke is in a dip).  The Southern Fried Okra and Fried Green Tomatoes were a little too greasy for my taste.  More breading would have set them off!   My friends said the wings were just ok, they needed more sauce on them.  My friend's mom had the Grilled Salmon; she said she enjoyed it.  My friend said his Po Boy Sandwich was "ok".  He went to school in New Orleans so he had high expectations. For dessert, I had the Snickers Ice Cream Pie. I was pretty underwhelmed.  It had a somewhat gritty texture, too many peanuts and was soupy.

I wanted to score Lucille's higher but too many "OKs" across the board.  No one was excited about their dishes.  And to me BBQ (with creole/cajun influence) is definitely supposed to be exciting! The pluses: Nice servers, the portions are very generous and as I mentioned before, we really enjoyed the biscuits."}

I'm a little bit of an awkward geek, and I always find myself pretty comfortable here, regardless of the time of day or my mood at the time. Hang around the outdoor area around the side and back; that's the best spot in town and everybody seems to know it.
Since it's just off-campus, they're naturally a little extra careful regarding ID checks. Both entrances are usually manned by someone checking IDs, and it's pretty much the standard for downtown Tempe, so get used to it. Drinks aren't cheap, but run pretty much standard for the area, and they do have a pretty decent selection of brews for the beer snobs (count me among said group). Their daily specials are worth taking advantage of when you can, and their food is pretty tasty when you're hungry and just need to chow. I'm not a huge seafood fan (blame my desert heritage), but even I can enjoy these things they call "Oysters Rockafeller".
I think what I like most about the place is the interesting mix of people you're bound to meet here. It's deep in the heart of college town, smack dab in a neighborhood populated by crunchy old granolas and tattooed art punks. I think I ran into my old life drawing teacher there half a dozen times. Just don't let yourself be intimidated by the d-bag hipsters, and you can have yourself a pretty good time.
Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest, but it's a rare place where you can find a steady flow of patrons and regulars every night of the week. I suppose that's the benefit of literally being the "friendly neighborhood" bar."}

This is basically a campus bar on steroids.  The atmosphere is very casual with open seating outside and inside they create a list.

There were about 15 beers on draft, another 25 or so in bottle/can.

The food menu is extensive featuring (as respected by the name) a lot of seafood options.  The oysters on half-shell are excellent (be advise that the cocktail sauce does not need the additional horseradish the provide unless you have not tastebuds at all).  The fish and chips is very good.  We have also tried the tuna stuffed tomato, burger, etc......

I went with my family there was 9 of us. I knew it would take awhile to be seated with that group and showing up at 7, 30 minutes wait kinda what you expect on a saturday night.

we where seated close to 730 placed our drink orders. It took us 30 minutes to get drinks and by the time we did most of the ice was melted, and drinks had to be returned, not to mention i was given regular tea instead of the sweet tea i ordered, I believe sweet tea is a staple when eating BBQ.

I shared this huge sample platter with 2 salads 3 meats 2 sides and 2 deserts, yeah i was a lot of food but i hadn't ate since a late breakfast so i was hungry. 

we got our salad late, about the same time that they sorted out all the drinks, so its close to 8pm. long story short we got out food after 9pm, they didn't seem to care that it took so long for us to get our food like other placed seem to (read my Tempe Dave & Busters review).

I don't understand how it can take that long to serve BBQ, its cooked in advance, most of the sides are made in advance, so whats so hard?"}

Now, now, I know what you're thinking, "We don't take kindly to sharers 'round these parts..." But put down your pitchforks, because the portions are proportionally reasonable to their stupid prices.

Lucille's lands at 2 stars for good biscuit and cornbread game, solid tri-tip and peanut slaw, and subpar brisket and mac 'n' cheese. In another region, I might toss Lucy a fourth star, but anything less than the best in this BBQ-splattered town just won't win my stomacheart."}

I would have preferred them for dessert! My S.O. got pork ribs for an appetizer and he enjoyed it. We split brisket nachos which were "eh".

I went back to Lucille's on Monday evening (06/24/2013) at the behest of a very special person. He knows who he is and I must say, hats off to you sir for caring so much.

My husband and I were extremely skeptical, but were expecting another flavor explosion and culinary button busting bliss as per usual when it comes to Lucille's and that fantastic kitchen of theirs. Again we expected the service to, well, suck.

Not the case.

Lucille's has taken on a Captain Planet-like "LET'S COMBINE POWERS!" attitude. Gasp! They've become a team! One that seats within SECONDS of a hunger crazed mutan-- I mean client, walking in the door! 

Drink order came 5 minutes later, arrived on the table 5 minutes after that. And boy oh boy that strawberry lemonade is the bee's knees. Seriously. It's summer time in a mason jar, sweet and tart and I swear you can practically find yourself sitting on an old wrap around porch in a rocking chair after a few sips. Nectar of the Southern Gods. Hallelujah!

We then ordered our customary half an artichoke and just about died and went to heaven. There's something about BBQ sauce on roasted artichoke that catches the smoke and flavor of the entire establishment and then dipped in that garlic mayo? Yuuuuummmm.

Hubby surprised me this time. He ordered the Cobb Salad. Granted it was piled high with egg and chicken and bacon. He dug in, could only finish half -- two hours later at home he killed the rest of it and was quite pleased with himself. Only complaint there? It took 15 minutes after receiving the salad for him to receive his requested oil and vinegar, but no sweat. It was busy.

Me? Southern Fried Chicken all the way. I think there's a growing trend with me, and it has a lot to do with chicken. Love chicken. Especially fried chicken that's done right. Crispy, juicy but not greasy? Oh I'm so there.  Lucille's delivered. The chicken was PERFECT. And we already know how I feel about their squash medley and garlic mashed taters. Heaven. On a plate. I only finished half and then tortured my office with the other half at lunch the next day.

So Lucille's? Great job. I'm incredibly impressed and absolutely tickled pink by your budding success. I hope this is a progressive trend and y'all keep up with it. 

I'll so be back."}

It's a coin toss whether I will have a good or bad experience. I have gone and had wonderful service and warm tasty food, and I have gone and had nothing but bad news bears. Lucille's to me is not GREAT barbecue, it is ok, good for Arizona probably, but far from the greatness of most barbecue pits in Texas. I do like the restaurant itself, it is fun and inviting and the waiters each take care of all the guests, teamwork style, which USUALLY means great service, but again, the coin flip. 
      My recent trip with Kristen and my Mommy went well, we had a terrific server (can't remember his name!), our drinks remained filled and our food came out quickly. The food itself was, again, good, not great, nothing special. The best thing was the fried okra, the best I've had actually, the okra seemed very fresh and was so tasty. I had the southern fried chicken and it was fair, the chicken alone was a little bland, but nothing the peppery gravy couldn't cure, the skin also wouldn't stay on the chicken, which is simply a pet peeve of mine, no big deal. I had sweet potato fries and mac and cheese with it, which were both delicious and I would definitely recommend them as sides. Mom got the Texas style beef brisket and Kristen the pulled pork sandwich, which were both pretty good, but nothing I didn't feel like I couldn't get at any barbecue chain. We all chose the same sides and all enjoyed them very much. 
      If I'm in the area and want barbecue, I would come here again, but I certainly wouldn't travel for it, I would just pick the closest barbecue chain and be just as happy. So I'm not saying don't try Lucille's, I'm just saying flip your coin carefully."}

Moral of the story, I think I should order bbq next time if I'm at a bbq place.

-The bbq sauces are good, very molasses-based (except the Memphis-style one), and delicious. Kyle's pulled pork sandwich was delectable. 

-Nice sides. Authentic braised greens, delicious corn on the cob, watermelon slices, shoestring french fries, mac n cheese, cheesy grits-- all looked great. 

The prices kind of stopped me in my tracks, to be honest. I kind of saw the place as more of a Red-Robin type stop, but most dishes here are at least $15, even sandwiches."}

For shame this place could boast such fine decor, beautiful menus, and pleasant hospitable staff and then char the short ribs to the bone, inedible. If it wasn't for the thick sliced, juicy, fried green tomato appetizer I'd call the place a total bust. The flaky warm biscuits were nice with the honeyed sweet butter, but I know Bisquick when I taste it and I'm sure I've made these before at home. We had high hopes ordering up some blackened catfish, baby back ribs, beef brisket, chicken halves, greens, cheesy grits, garlic mashed potatoes, and a kids meal for the little one with fresh watermelon. First round was the wonderful mason jar drinks, Strawberry lemonade was sweet, fresh and thirst quenching, our muddy waters made with sweet tea and porch lemonade were good enough for three refills a piece. You'll understand however that the refills just had to keep comin' when I explain how the main course turned out.

First they served up the catfish. I could hardly see the fillet behind the nearly three cups of potatoes. When I did taste it I realized this wasn't a blackened catfish this was a water filled thin sliced sponge someone left in the charcoal pile. No wonder it was hidden by the taters. Unfortunately, they were a mass of stickiness with dried chives. I didn't find a hint of butter, or garlic for that matter. My partner is Irish through and through and was dismayed. We didn't even bother putting black pepper on them or finishing them at all. I was excited to try the cheesy grits though. My first fork pulled out a warm melting bite and so I offered some to the little one, with some greens to broaden her Northern palate. The greens were fine, but lacking in the advertised apple-wood smoked bacon. It was more like a chicken bouillon broth. She opted not to have more of either. When I went to have more grits the mixture had cooled and was more of a 4th grade science project than a good feeling.

Then came the meat platter. The chickens looked delectable and I quickly separated the meats from the bone. The dark meats were juicy, but the skin slipped off in a greasy way. The white meat was far too dry for my taste, but fortunately there were three bottled sauces we could mix together to dredge it through. Of course I believe that in a good BBQ the meat can stand on its own and you shouldn't have to dredge it in sauce to enjoy it. The brisket stood on its own. In fact it probably stood all by its lonesome out on a counter for an hour before it reached our table. Maybe cooking it in a bag instead of a dehydrator would have been a smarter method. Then came the hope of the evening, the lump of coal left to taste was apparently five baby back ribs. I had to saw them apart with a knife to free them from the creosote. The limited meat was not even worth trying to eat despite the three table sauces expertly blended to perfection waiting nearby. We tossed it back on the plate with the bones in disgust.

My daughter couldn't determine if her fries were fries or potato chips or onion straws, she decided she didn't really want them. The macaroni and cheese side was a small serving of elbow macaroni which seemed buttered lightly. Her standard is no name instant, the kind you used to buy 5 for a dollar and she was wondering where the cheese was. If I hadn't allowed the poor thing to eat the rest of the biscuits she would have gone home hungry. I will never understand how you can serve a watermelon that isn't juicy. The fruit is 90% water, but hers was an anemic example with seeds. For sure, the place had some fine appetizers and the desserts looked absolutely divine, but we were done before we even got to them and the check was already too high to consider salvaging the meal with a one pound apple pie slice. I cringed when they dropped off a comment card, but in the end I did the right thing and filled it out fair. When I want a great BBQ I think I'll be sticking to BobbyQ's where the St. Louis ribs are rubbed right and then bathed in a sauce you can't stop lickin' and where they send you home with beignets even if you don't order any, courtesy of the house."}

I had the hot link and rib combo, which consists of a hot link, three ribs, one side and a slice of watermelon. I thought the portion was good but I wished I had only got the ribs (baby back). There are three sauces (Memphis, Original, and Hot/Spicy) on the table. The Memphis is tangy like a Heinz 57 steak sauce.The service was good and attentive.

Lucille's is hidden away in the back lot of Tempe Marketplace but that has not in the least hindered their business.

What we got: Fried pickles, they came in wedges not slices and it was phenomenal except for the bit where the juice from the pickle will burn your mouth if you're not careful.  I wasn't too impressed by their wings and probably wouldn't be getting them again.  For our entrées, we had 1) salad, which seemed nothing out of the ordinary.  2) A full rack of baby back ribs, dont even bother getting half a rack cause its never worth it. It comes with two sides and I was impressed that they give you an entire ear of corn instead of a third of one.  But I may be biased but Bobby Q's ribs are better, sorry Lucille.  3) The tri-tip sandwich was pretty damn amazing, though I was a little disappointed that it was on a regular burger bun especially after I saw the dressed up steak sandwich.  4) The steak sandwich was great in what I think was ciabatta and covered in arugula.

For me, what bumps them up from a 3 star to 4 star joint, is their service.  They had made a mistake with the steak sandwich and slathered mayo on both sides of the bread though we explicitly told them not to.  But when we brought it up to them, they immediately offered to replace it, took it off our bill, and to top that off, dessert was on the house.  We took up their offer and got the apple beignets which had too little apple for my liking but was a treat nonetheless.

All in all, amazing experience and I'll definitely be back!"}

I get the feeling that Snooze coasts on its great location and outdoor seating, thinking it can just mail in the rest. One of my biggest pet peeves about any restaurant...but especially one of this caliber and price point as opposed to a Waffle House or Denny's...is when an otherwise great server takes your order then hands you off to food runners who make no attempt to confirm the accuracy of orders when they're brought out, which is exactly what happened. The customer is put in the uncomfortable position of having to re-explain the order to a completely new employee oblivious to the original order, wait to eat the corrected order while everyone else digs in, and in my case eat the very dull and lack-luster final product that wasn't anywhere near worth the wait. In my case, I had breakfast tacos, featuring bland corn tortillas, barely heated and snow-white colored hash browns, and a scramble with little seasoning.

The sweet potato pancake is a must! We have ordered it a la carte and it was worth the almost $5. I couldn't have 3 myself just because I can't handle that must sticky, thick sweet.

As a newer location, the décor resembled their other restaurants. The signatory yellow light fixtures corresponded with a good number of round tables. The structure also facilitated a row of stools facing the large windows, and a full bar in the back. By extension, the sidewalk patio added character and spaciousness to the restaurant. Fortunately, we arrived early enough and did not have to wait for a table.

The Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup ($7.50) came with a conventional bread and cheese sandwich, tomato soup, and hash brown. There was a light crunch on the bread, but not enough cheese to translate into that gooey experience I was looking for. For the price, I was expecting better value and taste on the sandwich. The tomato soup was rich, hearty, and had a slight kick in the end. The hash brown was soft and needed more crispy edges. It was not the best grilled cheese, but it did hit the spot.

The Pancake Flight ($9) came with our choice of blueberry pancake, sweet potato pancake, and the chocolate ganache pancake. All three of us agreed the sweet potato pancake was the most impressive, as the buttermilk and caramel flavors accompanied a touch of ginger butter and handfuls of pecans tossed on top. The server endorsed the blueberry pancake, but it tasted rather conventional. I wished there were wholesome blueberries embedded, and that these pancakes were easier to cut into. The dark chocolate ganache concoction was without depth and the least impressive.

Service was very sporadic and not warm or welcoming as I expected of breakfast places. Overall, the food were nowhere close to the experience I previously had at their sister restaurants. The food hit the spot but there was no wow factor whatsoever. Additionally, I thought the execution on the Grilled Cheese was very poor for the price and a restaurant of this caliber.

Very clean venue, good value pricing on the menu friendly and fast service b I ordered an egg white omelette with chicken sausage, wheat toast and hashbrowns. My omelette was perfectly prepared I also had jalapeños spinach and tomatoes. I had a very exotic brand of wheat toasted not sure what it was but it was fresh and tasty. Hashbrowns came out it in an usual circular presentation but they were perfect. Restroom small but clean. Many different seating options which I love the venue is very bright. Outdoor patio seating is complete with a ping-pong table and games. Parking is a little tough metered parking outside if you're lucky. Parking lot right next-door at the sign is hidden"}

I came in by myself and needed a table for 1. The hostess told me she didn't have any available so suggested I eat at the bar. 
I ate at the bar and the female bartender was very timely in her service. However, she seemed to be rushing me to leave. There was also another guy working there who asked if I was being assisted and then kept checking on me... but his demeanor wasn't friendly. The restaurant didn't seem to be busy as there were a few staff members standing around and chatting. The check was dropped and I was told "no rush" but without a smile and the metal clipboard was dropped on the counter versus being set on the counter.
I know what type of experience the other locations provide.. and this location has some room to grow in creating a good experience for their customer."}

The coffee came quickly but it was freezing cold outside so i drank the coffee as quickly as it was poured.  They never offered to refill my coffee.  The food finally came out.  The toast was warm and thick and covered in butter.   The eggs that i had asked overhard came out almost over done and scrambled.  The corned beef hash was almost non existent.

That place was straight. The food, the drinks, the atmosphere and the service was all top notch, 5 star stellar. This one? Not so much. The food taste-wise was a 4 and the portion of my homemade hash was kinda sorry. I left still a little hungry. Adult beverages were a 4 as well, despite the Michelada my Honey got being just a little watery. While the staff weren't downright rude, they're college kids (to be expected) with impatient attitudes and obviously fake sentiment. I can deal with that. I think the main reason I'm giving this one a 3 star is because of the absolutely obnoxious music that was being played. For Sunday brunch, I really DO NOT want to listen to Dubstep, Techno (or anything even closely related) or your favorite shitty rapper talking about all his latest sexual conquests. I hate country music but I would've taken that over the noise that was coming out of the speakers while I was there. I'll probably give this place another try but I've had better luck the past few times I went to Postino's in Phoenix. Maybe I'll try the Postino's next door instead."}

After she said that, a new party came in and then the lady who came to seat us despite being told there are two parties only took the group that came in after us. When she returned another group had come in and the lady began prepping for that party to be seated (again ignoring us) and when the other person in my party asked about that she said in a snippy, rude tone "yes, i just sent you a text!" (she hadn't, we'd been waiting after having received the message that our table was ready for about 5-10 minutes) and then seated the second party to arrive after us. Then a different person took us to our table, finally. Ultimately, that woman (working at 10:30, who was seating people) was incredibly rude, and the experience was awful and we ended up leaving because that one person gave me such a horrible time.

Can hang out for free coffee while waiting or enjoy a nice stroll if the nearby ASU campus."}

Inside the restaurant the music is extremely loud plus the abundance of chatter makes it very difficult to hear your brunch mates. Perhaps that makes me sound old, but I don't get to see these guys all the time so when I do I'd like to be able to converse with them. 

Sitting outside isn't really much of an option in the summer either. There didn't appear to be much shade or misters to try to beat the heat so unless you enjoy becoming a melted burnt mess inside you go.

The service was alright, but the servers definitely seem overwhelmed with the crowd of people. We barely saw the poor thing who was busy running around. Did I mention the place was slam packed? 'Cause it was. That being said the wait time to get in was only about 20 mins.
 
I wasn't overly impressed with the food I ordered. My potatoes were not crisp. (I like my hash browns to have a crispy seer.) Also, there were some gross soggy pieces of bacon fat in my dish. I took the most of it home and reheated it in a skillet with some butter and that did turn out delicious. 

The pancakes are where it is at though! We split a pancake flight and I have to say all 3 different kinds were fantastic! They were light and fluffy and full of flavor. They each were so good individually I don't think I could even pick one favorite of the bunch. I highly recommend trying the ones we had: Strawberry Fields, Blueberry Danish and Peanut Butter Cup. I have a feeling the rest of the pancakes and the french toast are probably equally was tasty as well. 

Oh yeah, did I mention the pancakes? Get the pancakes!!"}

I have probably been here about 4 times since it opened and it's now my go to breakfast spot in Tempe.

The decor is so fresh and cute but also inviting. Every time I've been the servers are great and always able to give suggestions. I have had all of the eggs Benedict but my absolute favorite is the chiliquiles benedict! It's eggs benedict with salsa, barbacoa, and a stack of tortillas instead of an English muffin. Seriously delicious! If you can't decide which eggs Benedict you want you can do half and half.

Speaking of half and half, my boyfriend was deciding between 2 different french toasts and our server said he could do half of each. They seriously go above and beyond to make their customers happy and encourage customization. 

Next time you need a breakfast close to ASU or you want to show off Tempe to out of towners, come here!"}

We are excited for them to open in Scottsdale, near where we live. I must say the art deco, bright ambiance gives the proper anticipation of a fun meal. I started with an MMMmmm Mimosa which was light and lovely. Carlene, our server, made the entire experience excellent. She even had a whimsical bacon and egg hair clip that she made. Shows you right off the bat, she loves her work. Since it was our first visit she brought us (on her) the pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter. I don't even like sweets, but it was DIVINE! We all scooped it up. Our sweet daughter had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, which she loved. The soup almost tasted like a marinara. Very fresh and delicious. I had the lox, rye, capers, herbed goat cheese, and arugula plate. It was very good. My husband had the corned beef hash. It came out cold and they immediately retired it and made it right. The manager( forgot his name- glasses and a ponytail) did a great job of assuring that it would be perfect the next time. 

All in all, we are not going to want to wait until the end of August when Kierland opens so we will be back. BRAVO! Laurie and Rodney Malone"}

I came here for the breakfast pot pie, and was sold on the pancakes and cocktails. Let me back up... the breakfast pot pie was good, but I wouldn't say it was 'great'. There was nothing wrong with it, it just had a few spices that don't match my tastes. Loved that it was in a puff pastry though, and that you get to choose the type of egg you want on top! Also, major bonus points at Snooze for being able to swap out different sides to customize your dish without it impacting the price- probably the best part about Snooze as a whole. I really wanted corned beef hash (which was A-MAZING) so I subbed out the regular hash browns for that instead.

Anyways, THE PANCAKES. I got a single blueberry danish pancake as a side to my pot pie, and oh my gosh I wish I had gotten a full stack. Normally, when you get sweetly flavored pancakes, they are super, supppppper sweet - you can hardly taste the pancake underneath. This was not the case at all at Snooze. This was the fluffiest, tastiest buttermilk pancake with a delicious light and sweet lemon cream cheese filling. The streusel, sweet cream, and blueberry topping are lightly drizzled over the top. No overkill at all - the perfect light enhancement to the delicious buttermilk of the pancake.

For beverage, if you don't get the mountain mule, you are severely missing out. This might have been the best breakfast cocktail I've ever had in my life, and I'm a big fan of brunch, so thats saying A LOT.

I will DEFINITELY be making Snooze a regular in my brunch rotation... I may even go back next weekend."}

I went here originally in Boulder, and when I came to Phoenix I was really happy that they also had Snooze. It is a great place. The first time, I got a benny duo with the traditional (dat hollandaise was amazing) and the verde pulled pork (also gr8). The second time, I got the pancake flight. There was a sweet potato pancake which was not my thing but the blueberry danish pancake was amazing and delicious and next time, I am getting just that probably. The menu is diverse and great and expensive but I think brunch is worth spending big bucks on so I recommend it to all my fellow brunch lovers."}

His roommate took us here (he always takes us the best places) when we said we wanted breakfast.  We had a nice walk from our hotel and only a short wait to get a table.  The place was hoppin'.  We ate on the patio, which was perfect as it was a beautiful day.  Our server was peppy and attentive.  They were doing a 50s beach/surfer theme, so staff was all dressed in character.  

I ordered the Snooze breakfast burrito and a mimosa.  It was very flavorful and I liked that it was black beans instead of refried.  My husband got the corned beef hash breakfast and was equally impressed.  It was very hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there are so many options.  They have a breakfast pot pie that looks sinful.  There are all kinds of breakfast sammies and they have pancake platters if you want to try different flavors.

I would love to eat here again on our next Tempe trip."}

And, seeing as how I won't get my fix until my next trip out west in May, I made the most of it with a pancake flight (blueberry Danish, pineapple upside down cake and molten chocolate lava).  Seriously the best gluten free pancakes EVER and the pineapple upside down was hands down the favorite.

Also, I love that they have gluten free toast for the benedicts, and that you can mix and match.  I got the Bella Benny and one with lox.  Perfectly seasoned everything, and my only regret is again, that there isn't one in my hometown.

If you don't have a Snooze near you, you owe it to yourself to make a trip when you find one near!"}

I have been a server for nine years so I try to be very understanding of the potential for things to go wrong within the restaurant, but a good attentive server whom is apologetic when things do go wrong can save a bad visit.  Each time I have been to snooze the servers are far from accommodating and unfriendly.  Today my friend and I came into eat and the visit started as an average experience.  We ordered quickly and the bartender was prompt.  Our food however took along time to come out, about 25-30 minutes and when it arrived both plates of good were very cold.  It took us about five minutes to track down a different employee to send it back. While we waited for our plates to be remade we were not offered refills on empty drinks or offered another bar drink. The plates than took another 20 minutes to be remade.  I was appreciative that the manager came and apologized and offered to take care of our entrees.  When one of the bartenders came and dropped the tab she said well as the meals were taken care of so hope that made you happy.  It was a very snide and rude remark and first of all we didn't want the meal comped.  We wanted hot food and in a timely fashion. Needless to say after her comment I will no longer return to snooze. I can make a better, more pleasant breakfast at home and I would rather give my business to a more pleasant and deserving staff."}

I was super excited to try it and was disappointed both with the food and the service. They told us the wait would be 30 minutes, we waited over double this. It took over an hour.
The thing that particularly frustrated me is that toward the end of my wait, I watched two people just waltz in in front of us. Apparently they had some open bar seating available that was first come first serve, and no one mentioned to us that this was an option.

By the time I got to my seat I was a little annoyed, but the menu looked good and after the wait I really wanted to enjoy myself. The server took our order, and literally never came back. Someone else brought out the food, and we practically had to beg the guy to take our money since he had evidently forgot we were there.

To add fuel to the fire, neither of our meals were good. I wouldn't say it was awful, but it definitely wasn't anything worth going back for. The food was plain and cooked poorly. I was really disappointed in the entire experience and won't be going back."}

Walking back from Tempe park, I wanted to stop for breakfast sooner but I didn't have money with me, I had to go back to my car first to get my credit card. Conveniently located next to where I parked, this restaurant was perfect as I didn't have to walk anymore.

Initially I was told 20 mins wait, but they have some seats available with bar height chairs, I was told they were first come first served. Shortly after I sat down, friendly server came to take an order. She was extremely busy but her service was prompt. 

Food is excellent. We had pinnacle upside down pancake and ham Benedict, both tasted very good, solid breakfast.  Porched egg was cooked perfect, good sauce, I also enjoyed their hash browns. Good textures.  Good portion size, definitely hit the spot after running.

Parking was free for runners when I arrived at 6:30am but notice they charge $5 for special event when I came back. Not sure how much is parking normally.

The Good
1. Friendly service 
2. Nice food and beverage selection including some lower calorie choices.
3. Reasonable prices 
4. Lots of outdoor seating 
5. Cheerful decor

The Meh

1. Can be a bit crowded 
2. Parking is hard to find, even in the parking structure that is not cheap
3. A little on the loud side 

I had the egg white frittata which was light and flavorful. I would definitely have it again!

Pretty cool place and consistently good food."}

A quick look on Yelp for some good eats and SnoozeAM had all the stars and solid reviews to coerce us into taking the drive into Tempe. 
The line was long, wait time longer but low and behold two seats were available at the bar. We giggled with glee as we swooped in on the coveted bar stools. Immediately we were greeted and given menus, and we already knew that we were ready for our Mary's. I had a spicy Bloody Mary and my Love had the Beet Juice Mary. Different but good. More on the refreshing side. Very nice! 
I ordered the egg white frittata Florentine and hubby had the "pick two" eggs Benedict ... chilaquiles and pulled pork. He wasn't a fan of the chilaquiles but loved the pork one. 
Earlier we debated on whether or not we should split a pancake. Our server must have overheard this small debate because she came out with this amazing complimentary pecan caramel pancake for us to share! 
Fifth star earned! 
Menu is full of goodness and we would for sure go back! 
Five stars " brunch and beyond!" Review for SnoozeAM!"}

So delicious that I don't want to order anything else on the menu because I already fell in love with the first item I tried. I recommend coming early because they don't take reservations in advance, they're kind of a first come first serve type of restaurant. They're dog friendly. So, come and bring your pooches!

DRINKS: I started with a cherry mimosa-like drink which was ok, but the Bloody Mary was very tasty. It had a nice amount of spice. He started with a grapefruit mimosa and finished with a different mixed drink that he appeared to enjoy.

SERVICE: Attentive, accurate, friendly, and prompt.

PARKING: A parking garage which is $3 an hour is just steps away. I don't know if weekends are always free, but it was free when we visited.

Familiar with their restaurants, I first visited one of the Snooze eateries in San Diego.  When I found out there was one in Tempe, I told my friends that we had to eat there while we were in town on a work trip.  Three of us showed up around 7:30am on a Sunday and there was no wait at all, but I didn't expect there to be that early which is why we showed up when we did.  From past experiences at the other Snooze I'd been to, I knew the place would be packed before too long, especially on a Sunday.  I knew I wanted a pancake flight for the variety. You can order any 3 flavors available for $9.75. I chose the Bourbon Street Pumpkin, Blueberry Danish, and Chocolate Chip. The guys both got the Breakfast Pot Pie with rosemary sausage gravy, puff pastry, egg, and hash browns.  After getting a taste of this, I wish I'd ordered it, too, because it was amazing!  Not that I was disappointed with my pancakes at all.  I especially liked the Blueberry Danish one.
My tip for Snooze is get there early or expect a wait and share your meal with your loved ones so you can try more good eats."}

My friend and I came in on a busy Friday morning. There was a long wait but we were able to grab a spot at one of the high top tables facing the window. I got the eggs Benedict the third, my favorite. I definitely appreciate that there are hooks underneath the table so you can hang your bag/purse.

I'm easily won over with decadent pancakes and incredibly boozy iced coffee.

Visited the Tempe location with a friend and was not disappointed. We got chilaquiles benedict, salsa verde benedict, OMG french toast & a PB cup pancake. For starters - WAY too much food for two people but, we're gluttons for punishment and breakfast foods so we stuffed ourselves into oblivion. The sweet eats are always my favorite - but the benedicts were damn good too. The chilaquiles was my favorite of the two.

Only downside is the wait times are almost always SO. LONG. But, that's a sign of a good place, no? We put in for two and were told about a 30-45 min wait, which is pretty standard around late Sunday brunch time. They serve coffee in the standing area while you wait though, so that's a nice occupier. However, if bar top seating comes open it's first come first serve and we scooped up two spots about 15 minutes into the wait. Scoooooore! It's also located on campus, so take that for what it's worth - we figured it would be filled with boozing college kids (because you know, we're SO old & far removed from that lifestyle in our late 20's ha!), but it wasn't at all an issue. 

Eat the pancake flight. Get the AM Manhattan. Then go home & take a nap."}

My visit was spur of the moment, and selected based on best food photos lol. We ordered the pancake flight-- blueberry, french toast and pineapple upside down cake. Although we did ask for one plain pancake. So idk how that happened but score for us. We also ordered the breakfast pot pie w hash-browns. I was kind of sad that I saw the OJ coming from a container after I was already drinking mine.

I immediately dug into the pot pie, the gravy was more of a cool temperature. I had my friend try it too to make sure I wasn't being overly critical, or maybe gravy comes cool? Anyway Savannah came back a little later, I told her "I think this is supposed to be warmer than this?" She immediately said she would have them remake it. Round two came out and this time it was at least warm in some areas. My only suggestion is to make the gravy hotter or make it from scratch when its ordered. The pancakes and french toast were BOMB! I loved the blueberry the most.

Every employee said a parting greeting as well. I thought that was a really nice touch. Ill be back and this time I'm ordering the Chilaquiles."}

I asked if this was a new thing and the wait person told me no, it was always available and not listed so you have to ask for it.

Well Snooze, knowing that I can get my hash browns the way I want them kicks you up a star. In addition, it was my first time eating at the outside tables and wow, it was so nice outside, what a great way to start the day."}

First the good, I had the corned beef hash which was very tasty and so much better then the standard hash you get from most breakfast places. At the table we also had eggs benedict which were great, and the french toast was some of the best I've ever had. The coffee was above average for a breakfast place, and the prices overall were reasonable. The juices tasted freshly squeezed the overall quality of the food was great.

Apparently there is often an hour wait when ASU is in session, but with school out the wait was only 10 minutes or so.

Now to the aforementioned downside. My partner ordered some chorizo along with his breakfast. When we got the bill he was charged double the amount listed on the menu. When he brought it up to the waitress she got the manager who pointed out a section on the back part of the menu where the same item was shown with the increased price, then attempted to explain why sometimes it costs more and sometimes it cost less. When he pointed out there was nothing on the menu to indicate one vs the other we got a big eye-roll, shrug and the manager left without another word. It was only a difference of a couple dollars on a 60 dollar tab and an easy fix for the manager but the blow off left us annoyed and unlikely to come back, despite the quality of the food."}

Saw the ratings and decided to check this place out...a hipster, cool breakfast joint with amazing menu choices and great atmosphere.  I had the Hashbrown plate, topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs and added hickory sausage gravy and bacon.  Now if you are a "carbophobe" I would suggest you not order, but if amazing spuds are your weakness you won't go wrong.  The plate came loaded with country-style hashbrowns and my guess is 50000+ grams of carbs (at least) :).  Also ordered a cappuccino and was pleasantly surprised with it's somewhat chocolatey flavor that was unusual in a great way.  Breakfast for one with cappuccino and tip was $20, but very well worth it.
A couple of things to note:
1.  My Google map app was trying to take me wayyyy off course, so I am not sure if it was just my phone or if it's a Google map defect?  If you are unfamiliar with the area around ASU be careful you don't get sent to East Bumble F by your phone.  Take University to College Ave, go north on College and it's on the right near the aquatic center
2. There is no parking lot so you either park on the street near the restaurant or there is a parking deck on the little street behind the restaurant.  If you choose street parking the parking spots are metered and will take coins or, get this, will accept your phone reading a QR code to bill the parking fee.  I had no spare change and my phone would not read the code so I headed over to the deck and lo-and-behold...parking was free (it was Saturday morning, 8.30am and evidently not a "game day").  BTW the restaurant is maybe a block from Sun Devil Stadium so I can only imagine the mess it would be when the Sun Devils are playing at home.
I LOVE SNOOZE AM!  Definitely a chain that would dominate if it goes nationwide!"}

I am not a morning person and this place made me a happy woman from the time we sat down and throughout my day.  SEASONAL!! if they have the shrimp and grits, you MUST try it. 
We're here on a mini vacation from northern California.  We've been here since Friday and have eaten out just about every meal.  We've had some great food.  But this place was the best all around we've had and we're hoping our plans can include a last breakfast before our flight in the morning.  I like to try new things but breakfast is always the classic potatoes eggs and whatever breakfast meat I'm in the mood for.  We were seated promptly (coming in after work and schools begin, my have helped with this) the decor takes you back back in time a bit but the casual and freedom dress of the staff keeps you in modern time.  Lyle (the most charming waiter ever) smiled from the time he greeted us and never stopped. He was amazing and very knowledgeable with all ingredients in the dishes we asked about.  When we asked about suggestions he recommended the shrimp and grits and the steak Benedict. They are seasonal and may not be available on our next visit down here.  Then he mentioned the pancake of the day.  Bourbon infused with  white chocolate chips pecans and.... Hmmmm he'd captured my taste buds at "bourbon" with maple syrup... My husband was torn on which Benedict he wanted and was thrilled about the option to choose 2 (TWO) different ones to make his meal.  I was torn between the bourbon pancake and the shrimp and grits.  I really didn't think I'd like this... (who eats shrimp for breakfast? And I never cared much for grits)... But Lyle described it so deliciously I opted for the shrimp and grits.  The  Coffee was good and HOT.  All of a sudden this golden disc of dreaminess was delivered to our table (compliments of our delightful server) THANK YOU LYLE!  You'd think this would be so rich you couldn't possibly eat more than a couple bites.  You'd guess wrong.  It was just the right amount of sweetness. Served on top of the drizzle of bourbon syrup, this treat kept its form, never got mushy and was just perfect.  Before we (yeah I shared it) were finished our food came out.  I'll let my husband rave about his Benedicts. My shrimp and grits was beautiful.  Now let's see how this tastes.  I don't get too emotional over food but this dish was Devine. The spice was perfect.  I could taste both the sweet peppers and the hot peppers.  I absolutely love that they dice all of it small.  The only big chunks was the very generous amount of shrimp that came with.  The grits ... Let's just say I will be adding them to my own breakfasts now.  The portion was just right for me as I'd even had some left over.  Oh I forgot to mention the eggs that topped it all.  It was delicious!  I'm glad I ordered out of my norm.  I wish it was morning already so I can go back and order something else.  I'm bummed Lyle won't be there but I have faith that we'll still be happy with our new favorite "breakfast nook"!"}

I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage pattie. Menu says 3 eggs, though the serving looked more like 2. Hash browns were tasty, but not as crispy as iike them, and the sausage was alright.

My friend is in a wheelchair and it was next to impossible to maneuver her around the crowded tables of people without disrupting their meal. I had the sweet potato pancakes and it was not at all what I was expecting. I decided to try their regular pancakes and they also fell flat. 
My friend had the break pot-pie but the eggs seemed way too gooey for my taste. I guess I will pass on Snooze from now on and just go next door."}

She was also very honest on her suggestions which I appreciate. I hate the "everything on the menu is awesome" response.

I had a half order of the corned beef hash and the half and half eggs Benedict. You're able to order two Benedict's which was perfect for me. The steak and eggs benny is by far the best thing I ate. Perfect seasoning, texture and the steak was cooked perfect! Also got the avocado smash Benny which was also delicious. My wife got a giant burrito smothered in green chili and loved it. My kids both got the French toast house and cleaned their plates. This is our new favorite spot!!"}

We wanted pancakes but then something on the menu called our attention: the O.M.G. French toasts. We decided to give it a try, admittedly a bit skeptical. We were blown away and we were constantly mumbling "Oh My God! this is amazing"!
We had to come again the next day before leaving Phoenix back home. This time I wanted the full order for myself so I didn't  have to share it!  
I would give it 5 stars because of the OMG French toasts, the Benedicts were great and tasty. The MMM mimosa was great too. The service is great and friendly. However, my only complaint was that I ordered an OJ and asked the waiter whether it was freshly squeezed OJ, he said that it was, but when I tried it, it tasted like tropicana orange juice, which is good but not what I wanted or had in mind. Other than that it is the perfect place for your breakfast and brunch cravings."}

For starters we had Scallops with squid ink caviar and the Apple frisee salad. The entrees were, Sautéed Shrimp, Bacon and Sweet Peppers on a Lacy Corn Cakes
with Bourbon Crème Fraiche and Confit Mango and Sierra Nevada Mustard Braised Rabbit Leg and Golden Beet Gnocchi with Aged Balsamic Vinegar Reduction and Crispy Kale. For Dessert, Salame di Cioccolato and Espresso Gelato with Hazelnut Brittle and Sugar Crusted Moist Butter Cake with Blackberry Compote and Granola Crumble

The scallop was well prepared and the ink caviar was interesting. It was a little fishy smelling, but that is squid ink afterall.

The Apple Frisee salad was very very good. Of particular note were the toasted hazelnuts which provided a nice textural contrast and that wonderful crunch.  The sweet and tart contrast in the salad was expertly constructed.

The entrees ordered were on the whole, very disappointing. We ordered the Rabbit leg and the sauteed shrimp.

The sauteed shrimp were inconsistently cooked. More that half of the shrimp were undercooked. The chef would do well to season the shrimp before cooking them. My God, a little salt even. This dish relied exclusively upon the Bourbon Creme Fraiche for flavor. But the fraiche was too oily and left a slickness on the palate.  I didn't even notice any bacon or sweet peppers flavors in this dish. The dish needs some heat to bring it home.

The other dish,  Sierra Nevada Mustard Braised Rabbit Leg and Golden Beet Gnocchi
with Aged Balsamic Vinegar Reduction and Crispy Kale. The only redeeming part of this dish were the Golden Beet Gnocchi. The Gnocchi was expertly seasoned and prepared. The Rabbit was unfortunately terribly under seasoned and dry.

The Salame di Cioccolato was nice.  The Salame was more akin to fudge. It incorporated some great flavors. A subtle taste of amaretto, though it wasn't listed. The Espresso Gelato was smooth and flavorful. The brittle was the star. Brillant.

The Sugar Crusted Moist Butter Cake with Blackberry Compote and Granola Crumble was something my aunt Mable would bring to a potluck. The "Moist Butter Cake" was neither moist  nor buttery. The cake could have been from Sara Lee, but I'm not sure The blackberry compote was uncomplicated and could have come out of a can. The coup de gras was the lack of any granola crumble.

Again, the wait staff was exceptional. The chef needs to watch the Food Channel."}

This is not a typical American restaurant that serves a big platter of meat with potatoes. You need to be adventurous and have an open mind since the menu has some very interesting dishes.

We were seated outside in the courtyard section and we thoroughly enjoyed it, especially with the weather being so goo this time of the year! It was a cozy and romantic setting.The ambiance is nice and their service was very good too. Between the both of us, we ordered the lamb shank and the tenderloin steak. The lamb shank was served on a bed of cheese risotto, which was a very interesting combination. The lamb was cooked real well and the meat just fell off the bone. The only flip side to the dish I would say was, there was too much cheese flavor going on, so sometimes I felt the flavor of lamb was getting lost (it could just be me too!). The steak was juicy and moist and husband enjoyed the dish a lot. Both the dishes were plated n served really well. And to finish the day on sweet note, we ordered their dessert special for the night, which was creme brulee with pumpkin filling and I must say, it was a total winner! Though their pricing is slightly on the higher side, the place is worth a visit. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and a great time there!"}

Next up, was a plank of bruschetta.  Our choices were the proscuitto & fig, pulled pork (wow!), roasted garlic (also wow) and fresh mozz/tomato/basil.  All were seriously great and would love to try some of the other options.

My friend & split the heirloom beet & tomato salad and it was as promised - full of flavor.  The shallot vinegrette complimented the salad perfectly.  Our other friend had a turkey, brie & fig sandwich and said it was also great.

Although we were quite full, we couldn't resist trying out the "Crave" Artisan ice cream. The dessert featured 3 flavors and they were outstanding - mint chocolate chip, banana toffee, and salted carmel almond. 

The only disappointing aspect of our dinner was the red wine sangria - no one in our party of 3 really liked it. However, everything else was so good that I wouldn't hesitate to return....if only I lived nearby!!"}

Our reservation for 6 diners at 7 was for the beautiful patio, which we always prefer. They have a fire pit and numerous heaters, so we were comfy on a cool fall evening. 

We ordered cocktails, which took some time but they had a full house. Soon after we ordered appetizers and entrees because the apps are so big, three of us had those instead of entrees. 

For the table, we had a cheese tray, loaded with six cheeses, fruit and various breads. Two ordered soup. Tonight they served oriental onion and beef broth with crispy rice, cilantro and a heavenly addition of mushrooms. Mine was outstanding. The other who ordered soup tipped the bowl at the end so as not to miss any!  

One of us had the pecan smoked salmon (app as an entree), two had the Harissa spiced mussels (app as an entree) while the guys had halibut, rag pasta with veal and ahi tuna. 

Nothing but yummy sounds from the girls with the apps as entrees and the halibut entree. I ordered the ahi tuna but also tasted the veal. The tuna was seared perfectly and had a flavorful soy broth to dip into. The veal pasta was excellent as well.

I have to say it was so hard to chose what I wanted to eat...knowing that it was lunch, I decided not to go with the pasta (zzzzzzzz) and had the Quiche of the Day (Spinach and Mushroom) that came with a regular salad and a fruit salad.  (I felt so healthy...minus the ranch I habitually drown my salad in...)  I even tried Sarah G's salmon...(first time trying it...and I just had salmon tonight...thank goodness House of Tricks was my first try of salmon...)
I really really want to come here again and try another dish and the dessert!
A little negative on the parking...but what do I expect from Downtown Tempe.

Don't be fooled! This clever house of tricks keeps their way over priced, mediocre food and horrible service well hidden until you, and your wallet, have already be taken. Quite the slight of hand!!

I made the mistake of taking my family there for my wife's birthday (6 of us altogether). After sitting for 15 minutes we were greeted by Ben who immediately let us know through his inaction and disinterest that this was going to be a long night of "no service". Ben didn't need to be concerned, though-he was getting his tip no matter what he did, or didn't do for this table. Our choice should have been Burger King for the service, if nothing else. Sorry, no disrespect to those who wear the crown ;-). The bottom line-the House of Tricks has THE WORST SERVICE in Arizona!!! 

Their overpriced food features barely palatable dishes and the portions are small. If you eat there don't expect any "wow" from the food. The only "wow" you will get is when you see the bill!!

In this economy Arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut. We don't need a magic door at the House of Tricks, but we do need it to close!!!"}

Let me cut to the chase:
The ambiance is warm and inviting.
The menu is diverse and delicious!
The staff is on their game.
The happy hour is excellent!

Details:
I went during the tail end of happy hour (good from opening at 11am to 6:30pm) and started with a glass of Olaia Tempranillo Blend, Spain 2005 - normally $9 a glass but 1/2 off because of happy hour.  I love tempranillos and this did not disappoint: very smooth and delicious through and through.  I decided to try the $12 bruschetta plank as it was hard to pass up with all of the options.  You choose 4 of the 8 options (or I suppose you can go all in with a single selection).  I chose:
salami & house made pesto
roasted garlic, goat cheese, balsamic arugula
mozz, basil, roma tomato, olive oil, balsamic
prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil
They were all phenomenal in their own way, there could have been a little more arugula and prosciutto on their respective samples - but let me say this about the pairing with my wines.  (I ordered a glass of Poggio Vignoso Chianti, Tuscany 2007 that's normally $7 but again 1/2 off thanks to happy hour).  
The Tempranillo followed the goat cheese very well but was superb with the caprese style bruschetta.  I almost couldn't go on to the next selection because the pairing was so amazing.  The aftertaste and revisited splash of wine had a never ending appeal.  A wild outcome was derived from following the prosciutto bruschetta with the Tempranillo.  It was as if I had savored a fantastic creme brule with a blanketing of earthy meatiness thanks to the prosciutto.
The younger Chianti also matched very well with the prosciutto bruschetta and finished with magnificence after a bite of the bruschetta with goat cheese, arugula and roasted garlic.  That roasted garlic was the key, so should you visit and order the same, eat around the roasted garlic, saving a nice portion to match up with your wine.

It was nice to see such a wide range of wines offered on their menu (even better to see the glasses 1/2 off during happy hour).  The whites are diverse enough and the reds range from a number of CA wines (Cab, Merlot, Zin), to the single Italian, a pair of Tempranillos and a pair of Malbecs in addition to a Pinot and Shiraz from down under.  It would be great to see a Carmenere in addition to some more Italians.

I know they serve desserts, but I didn't indulge beyond a cup of coffee.  I'd say as a finishing touch, change over to the smooth yet robust Illy coffee and from start to finish the bill of fare would be top notch."}

I was a little disappointed with my mahi mahi which was in need of some seasoning.  All other meals were tasty (we're the kind of group to share tastes).

Our server, Piper was an excellent example of good customer service.  She tended to the pace of our meal with non-intrusive attention.  The timing of the second bottle of wine to the table was spot on!"}

I'm certainly glad I called ahead because the place was jam-packed when we got there.  We were given the options of being seated inside now, or outside shortly.  We opted for the latter to enjoy the beautiful night air.  The restaurant bar that we waited at was surprisingly crowded too.  I don't know if they were short-staffed that night, but, the fact that it took almost ten minutes to get the bartenders attention was just and indication of the way the night was going to go.  While the drinks (my manhattan and her mojito) were quite good, they were also quite pricey.  Far more than I thought they were worth.  Whatever, right?  It's for Valentines Day.

Well, that just kind of kept going.  My ribeye was.....fine.  Pretty tasty but....well, maybe I'm just not a fan of ribeye.  The soup, a cauliflower-chorizo blend, was good.  Again, just not worth what we ended up paying for it.  Happily, my girlfriend really enjoyed her foie gras stuffed chicken, at least.

All in all, good, but as a dining event, not worth the $100-ish dollars.  The service is pretty good and the location and ambiance can't be beat.  I'll give it another try, but there is quite a queue of places for me to check first before I rush back."}

We had sooooo many choices on the food menu we had a hard time deciding on what to order. We started of with the Mediterranean plate, which was fabulous!!! It has this basil humus that is so flavorful and creamy, you seriously can't get enough!!! Next up was the planks of bruschetta!!! We couldn't decide which ones we wanted so between 3 of us we ordered 2 planks! My absolute hands down favorites were the honey and ricotta, Mozzarella, and pesto!!! Oh my.... it's the next day and I am already craving these again!!!! 

Our server was extremely friendly and helpful ( Bri)! We absolutely loved her!!! She made our girls night absolutely fabulous with her attention to detail and knowledge, thank you!

I know before heading home I will be returning and highly recommend anyone else coming here and trying a plank or pasta!!! Bon appétit"}

This is one of the few places I regularly go without a Groupon! They do have great happy hour specials and I almost always get a good buzz going because of it. 

Pizza: 
I love pizza. Don't matter if it's Little Caesars (yeah I said it) or Oregano's, or even frozen. BUT, I much rather have good pizza. 9 times out of 10 I'll crave La Bocca. They must have organic fresh indigents because you can really, really taste the difference between this and your run of the mill pizza joint. Plus, the prices are so reasonable, you have no reason not to go. The crust is perfectly crusty and crispy every time and compliments those fresh ingredients. 

Happy Hour: 
Like I said in my intro, always gives me a good buzz. They have great beers on tap, the servers always hook it up with my double fist request at 5 minutes till Happy Hour is over. Plus my date always enjoys their wine recommendations. 

Ambiance: 
The place is just so warm and inviting. This is a great place to take a date. Guys, if your reading this and trying to decide between here and Mellow Mushroom or some other spot on Mill, just call your date and tell them to decide.  You don't deserve to pick if you've read this far and still have not decided. By the way, La Bocca also has a spacious patio if you're with a large group (as I was last time) or want to enjoy the beautiful desert weather."}

What I love about House of Tricks is the unique (never boring) appetizers, soups, salads and entrees with a southwestern influences.  The menu changes and offers seasonal choices.  The wine list is great and offers many wines by the glass.  I am not a huge dessert person, but the bread pudding at house of tricks is so good, you won't regret it.  
They do close during the summer months, so be sure you call before going."}

My husband has events in the area that are usually done by 9pm. We were happy to find that La Bocca is open till 10pm and they have a good menu. 

On our first visit, we entered the restaurant around 9:25 PM. The hostess was hesitant to seat us because they were done serving food. It was our first time and we were looking forward to trying their food. We saw people eating and drinking? She went back and asked the kitchen and said that we had 5 minutes to order. We tried to be cool about it and said yes we can order something quick. We were very happy with our meal and left. We have tried going back twice after 9pm. I believe that we saw the manager in a white shirt and waved through the window that they were closed!

The ambiance is 'cute.' The dining room is a dark, lofty, wine cellar-ish space with a Netflix projection on the back wall. Some tables have couch seating, especially on the patio, though most of the inside tables are wooden along with a few high tables. Like the couple seated next to us, it would be romantic and comfortable for those on a first date. 

We arrived around six PM on Saturday, a good hour before it would start getting any sort of busy. We were a bit disappointed to be seated at one of the uncomfortable wooden seating areas rather than be seated at a couch, but that's not the end of the world. Although, there was some sort of dark, sticky substance stuck under the table. I assumed it was a result of a balsamic vinegar spill but I'm not sure why it would have thickened to the under-table.

After being seated we waited an unusually long time before our waiter introduced himself... by that time we had already decided what we wanted to drink and an app start with. Instead of taking our drink order he let us know that select wines were on sale and that we should look those over for when he comes back, then he rushed back to the kitchen. When he came back we ordered the sangria carafe we'd previously intended to, to which he confirmed, "just so you know, that isn't on sale." I hope the service isn't this awkward when it's busy.

The sangria was nice and sweet with a surprising (and maybe a bit out of place) kick of cinnamon. 

We started with bruschetta planks - delicious and creative. For our meal we ordered the Porco pizza - I don't even like pork but it's hearty and shredded addition was undoubtably craveable. 

We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and licked that plate clean -- nuff said! Only before that my partner started to feed me a spoon of the dessert and THAT was when our waiter decided to stop by and see how we were doing. Laughing at the awkward, we were just fine."}

They seemed to be put out that we had an extra person in our dining party. The service was also horrible for a large party we had one night.

I can't get enough of their sangria, appetizers, or mint ice cream. Yum!

While I wouldn't say the Italian food is all that "authentic," it's certainly delicious. The wood-fired pizza certainly rivals its more expensive competitors. Although I admit I'll sometimes just order the appetizer sampler and goat cheese salad, (and a pitcher of sangria,) and I'll be set for the evening.  

The food is the main draw, but I have to say that the atmosphere is nice as well.  It's fairly trendy and the tables are candlelit--good for a date night or a classier alternative to a normal evening on Mill. 

I would definitely recommend La Bocca! Have fun, and don't forget to save room for the ice cream!"}

Since the establishment promotes itself as a place for great pizza I place a great deal of importance on that claim. 

When I initially went the pizza was way too much crust and not enough toppings. Now the pizza is much less crust and more toppings and the quality of the crust has improved significantly. My favorite is the Pepperoni pizza, made with these large slices and drizzled with Queen Creek Chili olive oil, and it is so good. The German style pizza with a white sauce, fennel seeds, and bacon, and a name I am unable to pronounce, is also super good. 

Now, as for the wine selection, for a wine bar, not so good. it seems like the wine selection could be much broader, especially for a place right down the street from a place like Cafe Boa. On the other hand, when the weather is good, a great place to grab some outside seating, a bottle of wine, and to enjoy some of the finest people watching anywhere in Phoenix (or more specifically, Tempe). 

Final thought, as a 40 something adult, making a decent income, La Bocca is one of the best places to go for a relaxing evening with friends. It seems that while chain stores are closing unique places like this will continue to grow and prosper and help to create a new and unique environment for Mill avenue (now if someone could just convince Changing Hands bookstore to open up again on Mill)."}

Almost as soon as I sat down (it's seat yourself at lunch time) I was greeted by a friendly waitress with a refreshing glass of ice water. The water was delicious; it seemed like it was filtered and there was also a thick slice of cucumber floating on top that was crisp and fresh. That was some really great water and I very much appreciated it since it was 100+ degrees outside and I had walked there from my office on Rio Salado.

After some pondering, I decided to go with a garden pizza. The pizzas are personal size but they probably could be split by two people if you got a salad or appetizer to go along with it. I ended up eating the entire thing myself because it was so delicious! I loved every bite of it! The veggies tasted very fresh and they were allowed to shine since there was no tomato sauce... just some truffle oil and small amount of balsamic on the arugula. The blue cheese had a bite to it but there was just the right amount so that it didn't overpower. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the center of the pizza was just a tad soggy, but I believe it was natural moisture from the roasted veggies. The pizza was not greasy at all. I thought the crust was the perfect balance of wood-fired crisp with a pleasant chewiness.

The service was great thru the whole meal and I really liked the decor and atmosphere. Overall, just a great first impression. I will definitely be back for lunch and hopefully happy hour so I can sample some of their wine list."}

It was a quiet birthday dinner for a long-time friend and we had reservations for early afternoon.  It was a warm day, but the extensive outdoor area is misted and well-shaded.  We were guests, however, and our hosts preferred inside dining.  The House of Tricks is an old home that has been remodeled into a quaint restaurant with exceptional food.

We started with a drink from the bar called "Weeds".  A hemp-infused Vodka with some other stuff, garnished with Bee Pollen.  This drink was quite refreshing, not too sweet and not too alcohol-Ly tasting.  A perfect starter on a warm day.  Passing on the appetizers, we started with a crisp, light dressed Caesar salad that was cool and refreshing.  The salad maybe could have used a bit more dressing, and one of our companions did ask for more, which was quickly delivered.

Following our salads, I had the Orange-Blackberry seared Duck Breast.  My wife enjoyed her Blackened Ahi Tuna.  Both dishes were cooked perfectly and the presentation was beautiful.  

The duck was tender and juicy, with a nice crusty sear, cooked a perfect medium.  The garnish only enhanced the flavor of this delicious dish and my plate was quickly cleaned of all evidence.  The wife hardly spoke during dinner, mostly because she couldn't stop eating - clearly she enjoyed the beautifully presented Ahi dish.

After dinner, the dessert people among us opted for the Salted Caramel Apple Bread pudding.  Once again, a beautiful presentation, a tall column of bread pudding, topped with a flavored whipped cream and drizzled with fresh butter and salted caramel sauce.

Service was impeccable, as was expected and we were not disappointed.  The dining room is a bit loud, and for a hearing-impaired person, this is a bit much to take on, so I would recommend the outside dining.  The bathrooms open right on to the dining room and there is a table right there, so that could be a bit disconcerting, but when I used it, I just avoided eye contact with other diners :-)

There is metered parking on the street out front, but we opted to park in the rear, where we found a nice, shaded spot.  This is a small parking lot in the back, so good luck.  Prices are on the high side, but for the experience and the food, I say well worth the expense.  I'll be back."}

The pizzas, salads and dressings were all top notch.  With most gourmet cuisine, the quality and freshness of the ingredients is what makes or breaks the dish.  The ingredients and toppings used on the La Bocca pizzas and salads were of the very highest quality. High-End and extremely fresh and tasty pepperoni, olives, sausage, basil, assorted chesses, spinach, onion, mushrooms, etc., were used on many different tempting pizza selections.  The pizza crust was absolutely amazing, the kind of perfect crust only a wood-fired oven and a highly skilled pizzaiolo can produce.  The pizza crust has just the right amount of crispness to hold up to the ingredients and sauces, while not being a tough bite.  The crust was super tasty, and had just the right amount of caramelization to give that super-good toasted flavor that is so great on a pizza crust.  The salads were very fresh and used premium lettuces, not iceberg.  The parmesan cheese topping the salads was freshly sliced off a real parmesan cheese wheel, not the canned stuff.  I, really, cannot rate the pizza and salad at La Bocca any higher.  I can't wait to go to one of the Tempe or the Chandler locations, and try more items off their menu."}

We just really didn't have a chance to visit. Well during the Memorial Day weekend we finally got our chance. 

Parking can be pretty difficult cause it's all street parking but the good thing is after 6pm it's free street parking. Woo hoo. 

As we walk in, you basically walk into a garden with many outdoor tables. They do have some indoor but they were all full inside. So outdoors it is. Outside has lots of bushes and trees to make the dining experience a little more private with water misters keeping you cool. It was really nice and comfortable once the sunset. 

We were greeted at our table right away and they brought us water and bread. The bread was really soft and chewy. Very fresh. 

Me and my wife started out by splitting a baby kale & romaine salad. It was really really good. Really loved it.  It came with fresh black berries, walnuts, candied bacon, and apple slices over a creamy salad dressing. Really fresh. All the ingredients really came together. Outstanding salad. 

I had the sumac crusted lamb rack with sweet potatoes and figs. The sweet potatoes and figs were cooked perfectly. Really good and moist. Melt in your mouth. Only problem was the lamb rack. It was good but not great. Didn't really stand out to me. They give you four bones and a fairly good portion. So it was okay. 

My wife got the brick roasted Cornish game hen and this was really good. Juicy tender. Fresh. I got to sample and it was very good. Both my kids got the beef tenderloin and they loved it. I got a bite and this was so tender. Melt in your mouth good. They were both raving about it. My mom got the smoked Korean style baby back ribs but it was a little spicy for her cause it has spicy red chile paste. I tried it and it was fall off the bone goodness but pretty spicy. Not that spicy but gave a decent kick. It was very good. 

So our server was really good. He greeted us and took care of us. Checking on us. Our water cups were filled on a regular basis. So service was really good. The food was quite good. Very fresh. All the dishes were really good but just wasn't impressed with the lamb rack (- 1 star). Loved the ambiance and everything about the House of Tricks. I would definitely come back again. Enjoy."}

This is a special place, but don't wait for a special occasion. 

Just steps from ASU we had lunch outside on the garden patio.  Evan and the service team was great and the food was surprisingly affordable.   We didn't take advantage of the full bar or the huge wine list, but I have been here before and the outdoor bar is worth experiencing on a cool evening.  

The food:
This is not your typical artichoke dip.  It has a great blend of spinach and green chili that make the smooth cheesy artichoke dip amazing with the fresh toasted baguette.  Best dip I can think of!

Garlicky smoked salmon Caesar salad: (Say that three times fast).  I like punchy Caesar dressing and this was no disappointment.  Between the capers and the garlic this salad is not for the faint of heart.  I was surprised when I bit into the cold smoked salmon.  The serving was so large I was expecting it to be a piece of grilled salmon.  This salad as big and delicious.  

Pulled chicken sandwich: My son said it compared favorably to any pulled pork sandwich he had ever eaten, and I have dragged him to tons of BBQ spots.  There was a big portion of smoked BBQ chicken on top of fried pickles.  The buttermilk bun was obviously fresh.  I am going to try it the next time I come.

I am giving the potato salad its own line even though it was a side for the pulled chicken sandwich.  The potato salad has a noticeable vinegar taste that balances the starch of the potato and the bacon crumbles put it over the top. 

Tempura shrimp and vegetables: Eight beautifully fried shrimp, pickled shitake mushrooms on a spring greens salad.  I had to pass on the shellfish, but my wife enjoyed it and everyone agreed their meals were top notch.  

One small disappointment was the lemonade, this place is too nice to serve soda machine lemonade.  Oh well when life serves you generic lemonade drink margaritas!  

Midrange fine dining and a unique downtown experience: Five stars!"}

I want them to be my go-to for happy hour, because the decor is just my taste, they are always friendly and the food is good. 

But when I do go to happy hour, sadly none of the drinks I prefer are ever on happy hour and no happy hour apps. Which is sad cause their buchetta is really good and so are the pizzas, I think I've tried most of the flavors."}

The pizza is still great and competitive with the other great brick oven pizza joints in the area.

The big feature in this update is the ice cream cookie. This dessert resembles the fabled pizza cookie at Oregano's, but is undoubtedly better. First of all, the ice cream is of excellent quality and comes in a couple unique flavors (provided by Sweet Republic). We had the mint ice cream, which had bits of mint leaves and chocolate chips in it, leading to an amazing fresh flavor (like an ice cream mojito). Second, the cookie was baked perfectly and had a large amount of chocolate in it. The warm cookie dough and chocolate had such an excellent flavor. Lastly, the dessert was reasonably sized for two people to share and indulge in the great flavors, but without over doing it. I wouldn't go here again without getting this dessert."}

Most of the seating is outdoors, which is generally not a problem in AZ, but it was a chilly day so we were glad we had jackets.  We had a 3 month old baby with us, so I requested a table along the perimeter, thinking that if he cried or fussed, it be less intrusive.  I was told no perimeter tables were available, although I observed a number of them that were unoccupied.  We were seated dead center, so I guess they didn't care about my request. Anyway, on to the food.  We all enjoyed our meals, but two weeks later I can't remember what I ate, so I guess it wasn't that memorable.  The restaurant, which is very close to ASU, is very old and appeared to be in need of some updating.  It was a great experience because of the people I was with, but I would not choose to eat at House of Tricks again."}

They are very generous with their herbs and spices. The pesto and tomato bruschetta is very refreshing and tasty. 

If you are not stuffed after their delicious pizza, I highly recommend trying their cookie and ice-cream dessert. The cookie is served soft and warm right out of the oven, exactly the way you want to eat a cookie! The mint ice-cream goes really well with the chocolate chip cookie, especially with the fresh mint they add to the ice-cream. 

A great place for a casual get-together."}

Had to cover it with crushed red chili peppers and parmesan cheese in a shaker just to get any real flavor. We tried more than one of these and they were all....uhhh...bad. Sorry, but they weren't even good enough to take home and eat the next day. Blah.
Had the tiramisu for dessert, and it was really nice. The waiter said they didn't make it there, but that's fine. Who cares. It was nice. Somebody needs to go in the kitchen and show them how to make a nice flavorful pasta dish that doesn't look like a truck ran over it and it sat and dried out for a couple of days. No, really. It was bad. The interior of the place is very nice and no complaints with that, except the waiters kept bumping my chair every time they walked by in a hurry.

First off, I thought we would be able to be seated in a nicer area since I reserved ahead of time, but instead the six of us were seated in an area that was just WAY too dark. Like, couldn't see my food. Could barely see my friend in front of me. 

Second, the waiters, as kind as they tried to be, seemed super stressed out and exasperated throughout the night. I felt pressured during my order to hurry up, and when the food came out, a snobby brunette literally dropped off our food without saying a single word, and when I asked for more water (since it hadn't been filled the entire night) she just gave me a face and never came back to our table again. 

Here are some of the things were ordered: 

Red wine sangria -- 2 carafes for 6 people made it to about 1.5 glasses per person. Taste was more tart than sweet, but the only fruit in it was orange peels. Peels. 

Bruschetta planks -- nice attempt, but I prefer Postino's Central. I enjoyed the proscuitto fig, but the other ones were not so good. Chicken/Tomato bruschetta tasted weird, and the pear/balsamic just didn't work.

Porco pizza -- the meat was good, cheese was good, but together it needed a little bit more spice, as it was a bit bland. Our waiter was nice enough to give us some tabasco but I never thought pizza at a place like this would actually need it. 

In summary, I don't think I would return to this restaurant. I thought the vibe would be smooth, relaxed, and ambient, but it was quite the opposite. I'll be looking for other pizza places from here on out."}

And worst of all the calzone has nothing inside. It was like a few flakes of cheese. And a dab of ricotta which was an up charge. Second time I have had a terrible calzone there. Last time I brought my dad because he was visiting and wanted a calzone. Well lesson learned this is not the place to go for calzones."}

For the entree she had a pan seared seabass which was good, but the accompanying black beans were a little strong for the flavor (I thought they were great but together it was interesting) while I had the buttermilk pork chop which was fantastic.

My hefe beer was excellent as was her drink - something with jalapenos is all I remember.

Definitely worth a visit!"}

The pizza was excellent and so was the pasta, I would have given a six star review if the server was a tad more attentive. 3 stars is generous and the only saving grace was the quality of the food.

La Bocca Urban Pizzeria & Wine Bar is one of those places.   I enjoyed a great Happy Hour and meal with a group of couples before walking down the street to Gammage for a show.

The restaurant has a nice modern hipster feel.  The tables have a bit of a picnic table feel to them, but not the cheap kind).  There's also a great patio that is on the alley side of the restaurant, so diners won't get pounded by the sun on a hot day and won't have to put up with too much of the Mill Avenue crowd.  The menu is exactly what you'd expect to find.  A satisfying mix of pizzas, pastas, salads, and bites, many made with ingredients from local vendors.

My table split a med plate (hummus, babaganoush, peppers, cheese and pita and flat bred.  The hummus wasn't the best in the valley, but the babaganoush was phenomenal.  We all had a variety of pizzas and salads.  I personally had the truffled mushroom.  Awesome first slice, but the over use of truffle oil eventually made hard to finish.  One friend checked in on Yelp and we received a free dessert.  We went with a warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie (made with Sweet Republic's vanilla bean ice cream).  A perfectly baked little "pizza cookie." 

La Bocca is also coming to local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  $30 for $15.  That will be a worthwhile deal when it's available."}

I love the atmosphere and the area the restaurant is in. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. The service was so-so. It took awhile to get in a drink order or for a glass of water or even a refill on the water. When I feel pressure to have to put in another drink order when I finally get my first drink order because I don't know when she'll come back, kind of suggests to me that the service has room to improve.  

The food has a great presentation. It started with this duck appetizer which I loved. The main course, however, was salty to me. I ordered the shrimp. I asked the people in my party how their food was, and they all said theirs was very salty as well, even the vegetarian entree. 

So I feel this place had some hits and misses. I would recommend ordering from the regular menu and not so much from the restaurant week menu."}

Knowing they have a small lot in back we tried there, but it was, of course, full.  I double parked, went in and told the hostess our problem.  She apologized and found the Manager, Ryan Brown, who spent the next fifteen minutes or so looking for a spot for us and finally moving his own personal vehicle so we could use his.

On this occasion we waited for about 8 minutes before anyone came and took our drink order.  We went there for restaurant week menu and the menu that was on the table was the wrong one.  Not a big deal just not something I expect.  Now, my pet peeve is when a restaurant that has such a nice menu and atmosphere serves me bread with cold hard butter.  How are you supposed to spread cold hard butter on your bread.  The server said they keep it in the cooler because if they didn't they couldn't scoop it to serve it. This tells me one thing.  They use crappy butter.  Good butter can be stored and should be served at room temp.  No real fine dining establishments will serve you hard butter that is not spreadable.  Other than that irritating me, the pork belly, flat iron, and carrot cake were great."}

We came during the Superbowl and found this place while searching for good places to eat. When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us that they were booked out for their inside seating. That was a bummer because it was raining and cold that day, but we figured we'd try outdoor seating anyway. That turned out to be alright because they had heat lamps above each table. We could barely tell we were outside except for the occasional breeze.

One of the biggest things I enjoyed about the place was that it cared for several stray cats. They were super friendly, cute, well maintained, and would adorably beg for food right beside your table. It's impossible not to feed them. They were a welcome distraction.

The food itself was very high end, high quality fare. We started with the wild boar, which was as good as good as the best boar I've had in Seattle. Great flavor, great texture. As for an entree, I had the lamb, which I was skeptical to order. I haven't been to a place that's served good lamb in many years, which is a shame because I love lamb. This place NAILED it. It was tender, flavorful, and on a long bone so I could eat it without having to use utensils (which was probably improper, but whatever haha).

I wanted to try dessert, but was too full. I didn't feel like the meals were all that large, but still managed to fill me up, so that was great. I'd definitely go here again for a special occasion. It's a little pricey for day to day visits."}

We sat and were ignored for about 10-12 minutes before a bus boy dropped a basket of icy cold, dry baguette slices on our table and told us the compound butter this evening was "orange poppy seed" (sweet). We waited another 10 minutes without anyone giving us a word or a glance, despite several waitstaff walking by our table several times. We got up and left without anyone saying a word. My daughter realized she left her purse and went back to get it. A waiter was standing near our table and he looked at her questioningly but still not a word. I don't know whether we were ignored because we were two women, or they have bad service generally, or it was just a bad night.

Sounds like that poor man really hit House of Tricks on a bad night.  His has not been my experience, so I felt compelled to share.

I will also state that observing the dates of the reviews, it does seem that perhaps House of Tricks is experiencing some inconsistent service issues.  I certainly hope that they hit this page, and fix their inconsistencies, because it has been a great place.

I am from Ohio and have had the pleasure to eat at HoTs twice.  The first was in 2005.  I was taken there by a bank during a business trip.  We were a group of eight.  We ate at a large round table outside, which in my opinion is the only place to eat.  Honestly, I have never been inside HoTs.

They have a full bar outside, high-top tables and bar seating which is  open (non-reserved) seating.  There are misters that cool the Tempe air to a comfortable temperature.  As a couple of other reviewers mentioned it is an intimate and romantic atmosphere.  The dress is very casual, you could go with shorts and t-shirts, but most wear business professional clothing which would be more appropriate for the atmosphere.

My experience in 2005 was excellent.  The service was attentive, the food was AMAZING!  All eight of us thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  Their wine selection is very good, and the bar drinks are very generous and their liquor selection is great.

So last October 2010 my dad and I had flown to Salt Lake City on business and were stranded by the airline in PHX.  I was SO EXCITED!!  My father LOVES restaurants like HoTs, so I was set on taking him there.  I called to see if they had a table for two and found out they were booked.  The hostess told me that they had three high top tables at the outdoor bar that were first come first served, they were open, and if we didn't wait too long one of them could be ours.  My dad was kind of tired, and really just wanted to stay at the hotel, but I wasn't taking no for an answer.  We hailed a cab and off we went.  I was so hoping that it had not changed and the food would be as good as it was five years before and I was not disappointed.  Better yet, my dad LOVED it!  It was just as I remembered.  Great menu selections, creative and inventive dishes which were well executed.  Wonderful mixed drinks, great wine selection.  I don't usually eat dessert, but we both ordered desserts which were wonderful and perfectly sized.

The staff was wonderful, the hostess kept stopping by our table just randomly to ask if we were having a good time, and checking to see if we needed anything.  I believe she was the one I spoke to on the phone, and she also greeted us when we arrived.  I explained to her that I had been there five years before and was so excited to be able to bring my dad.  She really went out of her way to make us feel welcome.

I have told many friends about HoTs, and I really hope to get back there someday soon."}

(It used to be fairly regularly for us with friends, but we changed our Gammage seats to Sunday a while back and they're closed on Sunday) I wish that I could say we had a good experience like we always used to but it was pretty awful unfortunately.  

We eat out at least every other week at busy restaurants, we understand slow service happens, especially on busy nights, (and we arrived 2 hours and 20 minutes ahead of the show to allow for that).  What we didnt understand is a server (I won't mention his name) who from the beginning seemed disconnected, uninterested, and seemed to act as though he didnt want to be there.  Even when things fell apart, he made very little attempt at making things right.  We have always had *exceptional* service every time prior at House of Tricks, so this was just so unexpected.  

Our food arrived quite a while after the tables' next to us, even though we arrived before them.  (They ordered almost exactly what we did, so it wasn't the type of food that was the delay) Our table was rarely checked on, (except by the bus-boy with water) and no attempt at an apology was given until I complained about the long delay.  Our server finally checked on us after the food arrived, and ask how everything tasted.  We didnt know, as the bus-boy had taken our silverware and didnt return with any until several minutes after the food arrived.

Overall the food was very good, (Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Portobello Étouffée, and the SeaBass), as good as we remembered.  The service unfortunately was pretty awful, and the $15 credit and free (single) dessert on a tab of over $210 was a sad attempt at trying to make things right.  No sight of the manager either which to me says the service issues extend far beyond the server in question.

House of Tricks was a favorite of ours for many years, it had been a toss-up for us between this and Monarch Cafe for a delicious meal in a beautiful, romantic setting.  After last nights experience I feel as though we have no reason to return.  Such a shame."}

Is it just me or is there a plethora of these dark, urban pizza wine places in the Phoenix area? Each one trying to be darker and snazzier than the next.

Well, for one of these places, La Bocca most definitely delivered:
* sangria, check.
* loads of bruschetta, check.
* cheese plates, check.
* make your own "urban" pizza, check.

Sarcasm aside, I really did like La Bocca. The wait staff was lovely and helpful, and we liked *most* of our food. The sangria and the bruschetta were delicious - five stars! But then things started going downhill. 

The cheese plate just didn't deliver for me - I actually couldn't eat some of them. Then my Brussels sprouts and proscuitto stromboli came out - and it flooded my plate with some type of watery liquid as soon as I cut into it. It was just plain gross. The server let me send the stromboli back, and I ordered a meatball pizza instead. The pizza was definitely a notch up, but I wasn't blown away.

We did end the night on a high note with creme brulee that was perfectly crunchy on top and cold in the middle. 

Although I'm not in love with places like La Bocca, this is a totally good option if you're on Mill Ave in Tempe and wanting some delicious sangria and bruschetta."}

In a city completed saturated with places "specializing" in bruchetta, with every place you go practically shoving their mediocre bread in your face, La Bocca has risen as the cream of the crop.

The fresh ricotta with rosemary and honey is a must.

I love that the menus offers to split the salad between two. It is the perfect size for a light dinner. The goat cheese and pear salad was fantastic!! I would absolutely return and have it again. It was full of flavor. The pear was the perfect texture and the goat cheese was nice and creamy. The dish was pleasing to the eyes and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. 
Although the food offered here comes from local sources, they don't offer organic options. As well, because pizza is the main dish on the menu, there is no gluten free options so I had to skip trying their brick oven pizzas which looked delicious.
They had a nice wine selection and I appreciated the fact that they mentioned where the wine came from.  Not all wine is created equal, but the Pion noir I had there was refreshing and smooth.

After spending a few days in AZ and having a bit of culture shock, it was nice to find this quaint little renovated house with a gorgeous outdoor patio area.  There were lush trees and plants everywhere, and even a few kitties that might live there?  My boyfriend and I even decided to brave the 100 degrees to sit out on the patio (we later agreed that it was just a few degrees to warm for that, but it was ALMOST bearable).  We thought about ordering from the happy hour menu, but that is only available at the bar, and we weren't super tempted by anything on the HH menu so decided to delay that for another day and just order off the dinner menu.

We started off with a smoked salmon bruschetta - it was delicious.  I decided to order the lamp chops with lavender potatoes (How could I resist lavender potatoes?).  My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon.  Oh my GOD.  So good.  I also had an Oregon pinot gris that made me very happy.  This was amazing food in an awesome atmosphere!

My only complaints about this experience were:  there were LOTS of flies buzzing around.  I don't really know what could be done about this - we were sitting outside, after all.  Maybe the restaurant could have some discreetly placed fly-catchers ( is that a thing?) around?  I don't know if that is even possible.  I understand that flies are a hazard of sitting outside, so I don't really fault the restaurant for them.  But there were seriously lots of them.

The other slight issue I had was that my boyfriend and I arrived very early in the evening - and we had a reservation.  There was maybe one table seated on the patio, with all the other tables open.  They sat us right away, but it was at a table RIGHT next to the service door.  Meanwhile there are all of these other tables just sitting empty all over the place, and we are trying to have a romantic dinner with people constantly walking in and out of the door right next to my chair.  I just thought it was a weird place to seat us since the place was virtually empty.

These two slight issues were not enough to take away from the overall experience, particularly the amazing food.  I would suggest House of Tricks for a special occasion dinner, and I will also definitely be back to try the happy hour.  This place is a gem!"}

The pizza itself was exceptional. The crust was cooked perfectly, chewy on the outside and soft on the inside; and the toppings were well-balanced so as not to overwhelm the crust. 

We didn't have any drinks, but the cocktail menu also looked fantastic.

My husband and I expected much better food and service for a restaurant with such high reviews. First, we specifically requested indoor seating a week in advance (when many reservations were still available) and we were seated outside. We waited at least 5 minutes before meeting our server and she didn't even know the evening dinner special (she had to read it off her notebook). She was very sweet though...
Food: We ordered the ahi tuna appetizer and it was actually pretty good. For dinner I ordered the sea bass with black beans. The presentation wasn't nice and it tasted like someone put an unflavored sea bass on a bed of black beans from a can. No flavor to the meal, and someone thought it would be a good idea to put cold tomatoes on the hot food. Also, I used my knife while eating my appetizer. It was taken away and I was never given another one with dinner. My husband had the salmon and didn't even finish it. Very bland and boring. We were so disappointed we decided to skip dessert.

My fiance wanted a nice place in the heart of Tempe and this place was recommended. We made reservations and arrived 5 minutes early. We approached the hostess stand and told them about our reservation and they told us there will be a wait. After 30 minutes go by my fiance comes up and asks how much longer (now way past our reservation) and the hostess response: 'I guess we can take you now'. We didn't let it bother us because it was my birthday. Our server came in a timely manner and got our drinks, appetizer, and told us she would come back for our entrees. We were already to order then but she left. After 45 minutes goes by, we have our drinks(delivered not from our server), we have our apps (not from our server) and now finished waiting to still put in our order. The server in the mean time repeatedly went to the table right next to us (no acknowledgment)as we wait. It wasn't until I walked into the managers office and politely asked to get our bill as this wasn't the birthday I hoped.
The manager took it upon himself to make things right and took over or table. He proceeded to take our order and offered another bottle of wine. He turned things around for us and that was very appreciated.
The server finally stopped by after we were already eating and saw that her manager stopped by. She never apologized but instead stated that she was busy with another table and assumed everything was good. To make things more awkward her blouse came undone, she turned around and giggled. 

At the end, the manager continued to take care of our table. He was extremely generous and the only reason we will be coming back. 

I come from a restaurant background and currently a manager at one. This manager was exceptional and made my birthday night turn around to end on good terms. I wish I could remember his name to thank him."}

Next I had the Kale and Marinated Mushroom Salad with Creamy Burrata. This one was a winner and was quite refreshing and tasty.
For the Entree, I had the Beef Mole Short Rib with Tamale Mashed Potatoes. omg. get this !!! It was amazing ! Right amount of flavor and texture was on the plate. The beef was so tender and had a good ration of fatty and lean portions.
I ended the meal with the Caramel bread pudding. Now this was a true stunner ! The caramel sauce was sweet and rich and perfectly paired with the bread pudding. One might say that the pudding is a little dense and rich. But hey, its bread pudding after all !!
Service was exceptional and our server Andrew had a pleasant smile throughout the service. They were even prompt in fixing an error with my friend's entree.

So many locally sourced food ingredients! They make their own limoncello, and even have a barrel aged limoncello, they age for 45 days in house! They even make their own mozzarella. The atmosphere is wonderful. My wife and I sat on the front terrace. The waitstaff was increadible. Very attentive, accomodative, and knowledgable. Our waitress' name was Brittany. We ordered a Bruschetta Board, and shared a Sicily Calzone with added mushrooms. Our Bruschetta Board was perfect. The bread is baked fresh at the Olive Mill in Queen Creek (an amazing local olive farm). The Calzone was ok. All of the ingredients were spectacular, but dish itself was off. The shallot was cut into very large slices, and the calzone was 70% sun dried tomatoes. I didn't taste sausage until 30% into the calzone. I spoke to the waitress about the calzone, and she said that some of the cooks were new and still learning. She said that the head chef had spoken to the cooks about the same issue before. Again, each ingredient was wonderful. The sausage, the sun dried tomatoes, the shallots, the dough, everything tasted great, but the execution needs work! That is why I have to give 4 out of 5 stars."}

To start off, this place is expensive. Wouldn't really be able to afford it if our parents weren't paying. I think for the 5 of us our bill came out to over $400. However, the food was AMAZING. We sat inside because it was a bit chilly, but they have a beautiful patio with a fire put. I wished we hat sat out there but I was trumped by the family. I had the lamb shank with risotto. The lamb shank was braised to perfection and the risotto was slightly sweet and paired with the lamb perfectly. I know nothing about wine except that I like to drink it. Whatever bottle we had was lovely and seemed to pair perfectly with everyone's meals. I would definitely come back here."}

Food~ I've only been for lunch, is Always Delicious, price, quality and quantity wise.
Some of my favorites include Quiche of the day served with salad and fresh fruit, The Grilled Salmon and the Chicken Shawarma Salad (see pics) 
The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)

Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all. 
Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar. 
I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.

Ambiance~ Love it, inside a cute old house or outside on the Lush and maturely landscaped garden patio.

*Notes*
~Make reservations for lunch or dinner just to be safe
~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters
~Dinner prices are near triple the lunch prices for the entrees
~Ask for a bread and butter basket, chances are you'll be here awhile

**parking meters have an 80min. time limit, mention this if you are having SLOW service

I  have to give 5 stars for the food"}

I wouldn't eat here regularly, so if you're looking for something like that, this probably isn't the place.

All that being said, the service was quite bad, and if you're gonna charge that much for dinner, it seems like you should provide good service. This was my first time here, so maybe it was just a fluke, but both the bartenders and our waiter were really inattentive. We stood at the bar for quite awhile waiting for someone to even glance in our direction, and there were several people working. Then our waiter was nice enough when we were seated and he took our orders, but then he completely disappeared. He never once refilled our waters or asked if we wanted more drinks. We finally got a busser to refill our waters after everyone had finished eating, and only then did our waiter reappear to give us the check. By that point no one wanted dessert or coffee, which probably would've been delicious, but we didn't feel encouraged to stay. I would come back, so hopefully the service is better next time."}

As for the rest of the service, I was disappointed. When you're a table of two, and you see 4 other tables (one being 6+) get their food before you receive yours.. You begin to wonder if perhaps there may be some preferential treatment here. My wife and I are from California Bay Area, and we've eaten at way better, higher-end places, and NEVER have I seen four other tables (whom arrived after we did) get their food first.  In addition, the gentlemen running the show, came to a table next to ours to fill up water, while my wife's cup was left unattended for a while, before I had to ask him to please fill up our water. When our food comes out (late), I make a point to ask for my check and boxes, a typical indicator that the food took entirely way too long and we are now running late to our concert. My plate was missing the sauce that accompanies the dish,  and the waitress was kind enough to apologize because she as well was surprised by the wait. My wife and I made sure to leave a $20 tip on $90 tab worth of food and drinks (5 total at $10+) so that the waitress knew it was not her fault, but rather the way the tables and food were being managed. I'm convinced our order was not put in until she finally double checked. Thanks to our awesome waitress, however, we would not ever return due to the preferential treatment we observed. Thanks for reminding us we are NOT in an eclectic area of Phoenix, High Street as they proclaim."}

I arrived on a Tuesday night right at 9 pm on my third visit and sat in the bar area.

Being the month of March, you really can't beat the outdoor seating here. It has a great, romantic atmosphere enclosed by plants and trees. If you were blindfolded and brought here, you wouldn't even know you were next to ASU and Mill Ave.

For dinner I ordered the Spring Mix Salad with Tomato, Cucumber, Radish, Goat Cheese and White Balsamic-Honey Vinaigrette and, for the main course, the Housemade Rag Pasta with Veal Breast Bolognese, Pine Nut-Toasted Fennel, Goat Cheese and Golden Raisin Gastrique. Sounds delicious, right?

The salad was okay, but neither the greens nor the vinaigrette stood out. The main flavors that come out were that of the radishes and goat cheese. None of the delicate nuances of the spring mix--hints of pepper, hints of lemon, hints of bitterness, etc.--came out. For the main course, I just thought that the dish was too heavy. Maybe some people really like it, but, for me, it was too nutty and the sauce way too thick and creamy. Almost soupy. Generally, in restaurants of this caliber, I think of the pasta dishes being lighter so that I can enjoy the delicateness of the housemade pasta, i.e., pasta should not be drowning. I'll leave that up to the Olive Garden to bathe the food in random cream sauce to mask the use of substandard pasta and ingredients.

My dining opinion is that the food does not taste as good as it reads. That being said, taking into account the atmosphere and the level of service I received, this is certainly a place worth visiting with a date, friends, family, co-workers, etc. to be able to enjoy conversing and dining outdoors in a relaxed setting.

On a date night, I would dine somewhere else and then come here and sit outside for dessert and drinks."}

Starting off, we ordered the Antipasti Board which came with a combination of meats and cheese. This was the highlight of our meal. The board included prosciutto-wrapped goat cheese - incredibly tasty! We also enjoyed the pesto sauce that was served with the toasted bread.

For our main courses, we ordered the Chicken Pesto Pizza and the Prosciutto Alfredo! The Alfredo plate came with a side of Caesar Salad. The dressing used for the salad was very bland and had no taste. 

The pizza was baked to perfection! It had the perfect amount of chicken and pesto sauce. No complaints. The Prosciutto Alfredo was also the right amount of cheese, paste and prosciutto. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough prosciutto but it came with the right portion.

Then for the entree I got the beef tenderloin with potato purée and bacon jus.  This was very tasty.  It had a nice smoky flavor.  It was paired well with the purée and garlic spinach.

My husband got the short ribs and he said it was a little fatty.  His was "Ok."

My brother-in-law got the vegetarian pasta and he said it was salty.  My sister-in-law got the butter fish, which she really enjoyed.

Dessert was a wonderful chocolate pots de creme.  Wow!  A must try!  Had a nice kick of cayenne.

This place a great ambiance.  I really like the indoor/outdoor options.  I would recommend this to visitors to Tempe."}

It was a party of 8. The place is huge, lots of room for seating. The ambiance is nice. We were seated outside. They area is filled with blooming trees and flowers.

The issue is the service. Takes a very long time for drinks to come out and to be checked on. The drinks weren't even consistent. I ordered one drink that was good. I ordered it again, and it was completely different and awful. The food is only okay and not memorable. What is memorable is how the server refused to give us extra plates and silverware because she didn't want us to have a birthday cake someone brought. She claimed it was the law where birthday cakes cannot be served in the restaurant, but I've been to several restaurants where that is not the case. She claimed that we can't have birthday cake because if we get sick, then the restaurant will be to blame. We discovered she is mistaken, and that if you bring birthday cake and get sick, then you acknowledge you cannot blame the restaurant.

I should have asked for the manager, but we were the third to last table there since it took almost two hours to be served. Everyone in out party was just sad and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. I was embarrassed. Thank you for the memorable birthday party. I'll have to be dragged here to come here again."}

Food was well-portioned and delicious --everyone raved about the chef's creations and no one took home doggie bags. We had the steak, ravioli, salmon and two salads at our table. Great drink list with specialty beers and wine available.
The atmosphere is a world unto itself - inside the renovated bungalow or outside in the lush patio - you cannot tell you're just steps off of busy Mill Avenue. It feels as though you have your own private party.

I am also a coffee snob and the bartender pulled a delectable, fresh decaf espresso (hard to do!)

Well worth the trip, whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just want to be spoiled by the staff and feel good as you walk away."}

Their food is awesome. Unique and delicious pizzas (and like Jennifer mentioned, huge air bubbles around the crust. *whispers* Thats my favorite part.). Their bruschettas are ALL amazing. And, IMO, the best dessert is the trio of salty caramel, banana toffee, and actual mint mint chocolate chip ice creams. I would honestly go back just for that.

The first time we sat at the bar, and felt like we were hanging out w/ one of our friends the bartender was so nice (and she poured a great martini).

The second time we sat in one of the comfy couch corners for happy hour (drinks only) and our waitress was equally as inviting."}

Ahi was nicely prepared but when bit into the kale it was "OVERLY" salted ruined the entire dinner.  Waitress apologized and took it off the bill offered to make another entrée my appetite was ruined by the amount of salt used.  NO APOLOGY FROM MNGR OR CHEF??? Not the same place at all.  Why is it so hard for a Restaurant MNGR or Chef to accept responsibility anymore? Shame was a favorite not anymore though."}

A group of us decided to go there for dinner before a show at Gammage. It was restaurant week so we made reservations well in advance allowing plenty of time. We were never asked if we were going to a show. Service was incredibly slow and when we had not yet received appetizers 40 min after placing our order, we were starting to panic. When we finally caught our server we told her that we were attending a 7:30 performance and she seemed so surprised. Food came pretty fast after that but unfortunately, 5 out of 7 dinners were cold. I think the cold meals were all from the restaurant week menu. Too bad as the food was good.
We barely finished and rushed out the door, just making it in time for the show.
I am sure I will go back again but I think I will stick to lunch from now on. I found it surprising that they just didn't seem to be prepared for a Sat night with both restaurant week and a show at Gammage. Was this a surprise to them???"}

Our waiter dropped a ramekin of balsamic vinegar on the floor by our table, which splashed all over my leather boots, jacket and pants and shirt.  Instead of getting something to clean it up, our server was preoccupied with the older ladies behind us- which were not hit but whining about their desserts.   Our food got cold while wiping up the mess- because it was everywhere.  

I get that this stuff happens, but the lack of care was very surprising.  I served tables for 7 years and I would have been fired if I acted like that to a guest.  My very expensive jacket was ruined...you cannot get vinegar off fabric and when I told them that, the staff acted like I was crazy.  The owner tried to replace my jacket with a cheaper one. I give her credit, she did try to make it right.  

Anyways, my cold food was not that great and the experience really sucked."}

Set in a pretty little old house just two blocks off Mill Avenue, House of Tricks has that sunny garden vibe that's all too rare here in Tempe.

When I want to ditch the office for a leisurely lunch (all too rare these days), House of Tricks is my hands-down favorite spot. A glass of wine, a shady spot in the garden, a gourmet sandwich or salad and some gossip with a friend. Perfect. 

Lunch at Tricks gets five stars, easy. But Tricks has two downsides:

- Closed on Sundays, when I most want to pair my pedicure afternoon with a fancy lunch and pretend I'm a lady.
- Dinner is only good, not great -- and it's very pricey (entrees alone range from around $20 to $35).

Go for the atmosphere. Go for the sun-filled patio. But if you ask me, just go for lunch."}

In addition to the standard sodas you would find as non-alcoholic refreshments, they have a great iced tea that is made with muddled fresh raspberries.  I had the special for the day which was the salmon burger.  It was quite possibly the best salmon burger I've had.  It was clearly made with fresh salmon, made from scratch, rather than a mass-produced patty found in the freezer section.  The salmon itself was tender, and flavorful.  I also tried some of the fruit and chicken salad, which was equally good, and very refreshing.

The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about was that it seemed like there was no A/C in the restaurant, and that the only cooling system they had were ceiling fans, which makes for a very warn environment, especially in the heat of summer!"}

Their outside patio is gorgeous and complete with heaters and a fire pit when the weather is a bit on the chilly side. But the indoors is just as great-cozy little house with a fire place.  

Just yesterday, we had the Mediterranean Platter as a starter (delicious!) and I had the fruit and chicken shwarma salad (so good!) with a lovely glass of pinot noir.

Starting with the positives- the truffle mushroom pizza was really actually pretty delicious. I'm very picky about truffle oil, after I had a very poor experience that turned me off. Anything too overbearing and I won't eat it. This is a good level of truffle oil. The goat cheese is a good balance to the truffle oil, and the basil is light and complementary.

The pasta bolognese though....umm, strange. There was a very clove(?)-y taste to it that was not expected. Maybe that's not my taste which I get. However, the pappardelle (oh, I forgot I'm not a pappardelle person so bad combo maybe) was nowhere close to al dente. It was soggy. OH and lukewarm - but I'll chalk that up to us having to wait 45 minutes for a pasta. The garlic bread with this was the highlight, but also - very lukewarm. 

Now service......ok so it was a Friday night. The place wasn't packed, but I guess it was fairly full. Still, my friends walked in and were seated right away. Within 10 minutes of ordering, we get our house salads. Following that - nothing for 35 minutes. idk about you, but I like to eat my salads with my entrees and multiple waiters kept coming to try and take my salad away as I waited another 35 minutes for my pasta/pizza. My friend nearly finished her pinot noir that she had ordered specifically to go with the bolognese as well so I guess you could say we were unimpressed with the wait time.

The part that disappointed me most was seeing multiple parties come in after us, get their food, and LEAVE before we got our food/as our food just arrived. So while I really wanted to like this place, I cannot say I will be coming here again. IF i were to come back, I would order differently and just stick with the pizza though - so keep that in mind if you swing by."}

Appetizer: Brussels sprouts salad with beets and a soft poached egg on top. I do not eat pork so I substituted the lemon honey vinaigrette instead of the usual pancetta dressing and it was still delicious. 

Entree: I ate the squid ink pasta appetizer as my entree. It comes with three large prawns, calamari, and a jalapeño corn broth. It is large enough for an entree.

Dessert: we tried the blueberry whoopie  pie - somewhat of a letdown - the outer cake was dry and the lemon curd filling tasted more like an icing - not enough tartness. We also tried the flourless chocolate cake with earl gray whipped cream and raspberries which was good but nothing special. 

The service was good, although we had to move tables from inside to outside due to the noise level inside the restaurant. 

The dinner was moderately priced, but the cute outdoor atmosphere and quality of the salad and entree made it work! Other than the noisy people inside and the desserts which left something to be desired, I had a nice time! Would return."}

I'm surprised to hear that people feel that the food is not good and overpriced and that they have gotten horrible service. 

The Food:
The pizza here is amazing. Top quality fresh ingredients. Anybody who says otherwise probably doesn't have a mature palette. Yes, if you are looking for a standard, greasy NYC pizza, go to slices around the corner. (Which is also good, just different.) However, if you are looking for a fresh meal that you can leave feeling good, go here.

The Price:
I think this place is well priced for what you get - Fresh Ingredients that complement each other. If you aren't full after eating here and think it is too pricey because of your unfulfilled appetite, I have two things to say. 
1. You need to reduce your portions- My husband and I can share a pizza here and be full. 
2. You need to understand that price isn't always based on quantity, but quality.

The Service:
Every time I go to this place, the servers (not just the one waiting my table) are always amazing. In fact, they are so good you would think they were the owner. On top of being prompt, they always are very descriptive and helpful."}

The bruschetta is unbelievably delicious. My mouth is watering just writing about it. They have 8 different options and you can choose 4 with each order. I normally get  the smoked prosciutto & fig, pulled pork & pesto, roasted garlic & goat cheese, and the pesto with roma tomato. 
Yum. Yum. Yum. 
I've had a few of the pizzas and loved them. My new favorite is the goat cheese & pear salad. Honestly I have never tried anything I wasn't completely satisfied with. 
They offer a nice drink selection and have different specials most days of the week. The atmosphere is sophisticated and relaxed. 
If you haven't been to La Bocca, please go. Right now."}

House of Tricks never disappoints. I used to come here for lunch, or tea/desserts and everything was always so perfect. 

I finally came back for my graduation lunch (they take reservations) and everybody loved it as usual. I got the BLT made with cornbread instead of a bun. It was amazing. The menu changes (idk how often) so posting the different things we got probably won't help. 

But the menu always has unique, fancy type stuff for a good price! Also the desserts are SO freaking good. One time I got a coffee creme brûlée paired with hibiscus tea and omgggg. 

The service is also very good and the atmosphere is beautiful! It's so pretty green... and if you like cats you'll love the abundance of furry friends in the yard :)

Hands down, fav place in Tempe."}

The different types of cheese and the lightly toasted baguettes were perfect! Salad was next. We both got the specialty salads before our entree. Yum.

The menu was even better.  We ordered the Korean Short Ribs and the Scallops as appetizers and were not disappointed in either.  I liked the scallops so much I would have ordered them again for dinner.

For dinner we ordered the pork and sea bass.  I had the pork and the mustard sauce was amazing! I wanted to take a bottle of the sauce home with me to have later on!

Lol for drinks I ordered the red sangria and my friend got the orange blossom martini. I wasn't too fond of my sangria. I think it could've been a bit sweeter. 

I would definitely come back for their pizza. They also have happy hour and reverse happy hour on the weekends that I'd like to check out. It's a really cute little pizza place. Perfect for a date or even dinner with friends. They have a great outdoor patio and it's right on Mill Ave. So good for people watching. =)"}

I finally got to try this place after hearing so many great things about it from other friends. The staff definitely did wonders here trying to fuel or pre-bachelorette party night fun last Saturday. 

The restaurant appears to be an old historic house - possibly even two houses connected together by a long welcoming stretch of a patio. It had been a rainy evening and cold one at that, so it was nice to get into the dining area where the ambiance had cozy and refined wrapped up in a bundle!

I think our server was the resaturant manager. He did everything in his power to make our experience wonderful for our group of 10 girls. 

Memorable items of the night:
Old fashioned drink - very well done and potent here. My first glass was Makers Mark infused with Vanilla and I think maple as well. They ran out of it for the second round, so my second glass was with Woodford Reserve as requested. 

Rack of Lamb - the special of the night. Cooked to perfection. Tender, not gamey at all!

Scallop appetizer - Appetizes only two people since there were only two scallops on the plate, but it was served with a quaint arrangement of small thin but very flavorful well seasoned vegetables. This is big coming from me, because as an outspoken meatatarian, it is usually difficult to get me to eat vegetables, yet I loved these ones.

The homemade butter was spiced and delicious in its own right when served before out appetizers with sliced baguettes. 

Overall cozy, warm, inviting restaurant. I'd say it's Tempe's own hidden gem."}

She gave us excellent wine recommendations that complemented our meals exquisitely, and she also threw in a lesson about gin and tequila, thanks!! I got the duck breast which was perfectly tender and succulent, my girlfriend got the lamb shank which was equally tender and flavorful. Yes it is expensive, but what do you expect?

We were strolling in downtown Tempe on a friday night and coming from a brewery but didnt want bar food. We decided on this place from the Yelp reviews. We came through the door and noticed it was not busy at all but no one was there to greet us upon entering. We waited about 3-4 minutes for a young lady to seat us about 8 feet away from the entrance. Our server was nice, and friendly. We ordered 2 caesar salads and a pizza to split. The salads came out pretty quickly but the pizza took FOREVER. We almost got up and walked out. I would estimate a good 60 minute wait for a pizza. Dont know who fumbled but the server made it right and did not charge us. The pizza dough was good and the topping was Brussel Sprouts. Pretty good but no sauce. Only 2/3rds of the pizza had toppings. It was dark inside and music was so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation. I would come back again despite these exceptions. People make mistakes but they owned up to it and made it right and thats all that matters. Our server was very apologetic. Thanks!"}

We went there for my husband's friend's birthday. All 5 of us swore we heard the waitress bring up the fact that it was his birthday and say that he got to choose a free dessert (it's not like it's an uncommon practice at restaurants). He told her what dessert he'd like, and we sat there for an hour just talking and hanging out. Finally, we flagged down some guy who looked like a manager and asked about it because it had been so long. It seemed like they just forgot and were going to go get the dessert. Less than 2 minutes later, the waitress came back and had this conversation with our friend that made me feel so awkward and embarrassed I couldn't even look at her. She's said something like, "Oh, I didn't hear you say you wanted something and you guys already paid. Do you still want something?" Our friend brought up the fact that all of us were under the impression that he got a free dessert for his birthday. She basically just said no, apologized for the miscommunication, and walked away after our friend said to nevermind. I was shocked. We'd been sitting there an HOUR under the wrong impression and they knew that. If they had good customer service, they would've just given us the dessert that probably only cost them $1 and apologized, but they didn't, and the whole dining experience ended on a sour note. I hope it was worth the small amount of money they saved. I don't care how good the pizza was, I will never go back now because it was so awkward and mismanaged. The food is overpriced for what it is, and they certainly don't justify the price tag with service."}

There were a variety of dishes ordered at our table .. The salmon with lettuce, the smoked pulled chicken sandwich, the frittata of the day, & the vegetarian sandwich. Everyone really enjoyed their food - the portions were big & the everyone agreed everything was really tasty. I was one who ordered the smoked pulled chicken sandwich. It was much different than any other BBQ chicken sandwich I've had -- it tasted good with the slaw, and the fried pickles added a unique flavor and crunch. I thought the highlight of the dish was the potato salad, however. The bacon added a special something but wasn't overpowering. I'd definitely recommend trying it out!

This little setup of a yard between two little houses holding a bar between them is truly a place of solace in the valley. It always seems to be cool at Tricks (probably because they smartly close for most of the summer). 

I have been here for lunches, nights of drinking, a wedding reception and even a fancy work dinner party. They seem to be able to deliver on the small or large scale with aplomb and style. Truly a feat to be lauded down the block from Mill where those words have little meaning. 

Be sure to go on a winter night when they have the fireplace going. It feels like you are transported to somewhere that has winters!"}

It's definitely a "date-night" sort of place. 

We sat outside on the patio. I ordered a Manhatten Iced Tea, which ended up not being my cup of tea (no pun intended), but it was a well made drink. For an appetizer, we ordered the Artisan Cheese & Fruit plate. Delicious! Fruit and cheese plates always make me feel fancy. The presentation was great..it was like a work of art. For the main entree, I had the Sugar-Spiced Salmon with Chinese Long Beans, Mustard Sauce, Sweet Soy-Ponzu, Sticky Rice and Nori. The salmon was probably the best salmon I've ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked impeccably. The rest of the dish was just as good..oh that sauce! It was sweet with just the right amount of spice.

One drawback I have noticed-Thankfully I am now a pescitarian because the vegetarian options are quite limited. I'd suggest checking out the website before going. :)

We were at the Yelp event,failing to pry anything free from the pizza vultures,and decided to just go ahead and order anyway.  I.E.,this is a payed for the food review for the most part. 

Even though this was a really busy,loud night,our orders came out quickly ,correct and were really tasty.Luckily we caught a free bruschetta plate while ordering so we managed to try all of them by the end of the night by buying those we'd missed. 

Ordered x 2 personal pizza and the chocolate ice cream dessert.The pizzas are way better on the top than what which supports them but  that's not to say the dough is bad it's just not matching the promise of that which sits above it.. Dessert was the OMG for two a chocolate espresso brownie with vanilla  ice cream. Nowhere near as dense as it sounds or as sickly as it could be.Really well done.

Maybe not a fair assessment to make on just one night but I've not been back yet to see how much variation between pizzas there are.Prices fairly reflect the location,interior and the quality of the ingredients being used. 

I'd go back if in the region, I'd meet people there as a kick off point but I can't say I'd drive from the W Valley just to eat here. ( Isn't that true of Mill Ave in general though?) .

So many of the existing comments accurately describe it, that I wasn't sure I'd have anything left to contribute. It's training wheels for a real wine bar - the wine selection is slim pickin's without much excitement. The bruschetta lacks creativity which is disguised by the fact that you "get to choose" 4 options. The pizza's is mediocre (albeit very good crust) but  decently sized. Realistically, I don't know what I expected from yet another restaurant striving to stand out despite its cliche concept.

The reason I write this is because the food doesn't suck and it's worth it to go on Tuesdays during happy hour. Half off wine, beer and most liquors AND it's buy one pizza get one free. It's a great deal and the price more so matches the quality of food. It is a good deviation from chains and not quite as expensive as a quality independent wine bar. Perfect for an early glass of wine on a Tuesday."}

It feels like you are so far from the city and you are in fact smack in the middle of Tempe with ASU nearby, yet so quiet. Parking is not a problem but you have to pay for it, no big deal.
The food is great. I particularly love their appetizers and especially the rabbit terrine/pâté. Their mussels are delightful. I do order a few appetizers instead of a main dish because I enjoy trying different and smaller portions of food. They are closed in July due to the high heat of our summers but as soon as they reopen we will be getting there again for dinner."}

I did a girl's night here for Valentine's day (we went the day before), and appreciated that we were able to make a reservation ahead of time. You can make reservations directly through yelp!  

Complimentary: Focaccia Bread
Deliciously warm, but too dry for my taste. Ask for marinara sauce on the side!

Dinner: Vegetarian Pasta
The freshness of the noodles made the entire meal. Great use of alfredo and pesto. The portions are generous and could easily be shared by two people. 

What was the down side? It took 30 minutes to get the food ordered, another 30 minutes for the bills, and another 15 minutes to get boxes for the food. Normally, I can understand if the restaurant is packed, but more than half of the tables were empty. I couldn't wrap my head around why the service was slow, especially when there were about 5 waiters on the floor (it's a small restaurant). Additionally, I had food and water spilled on me while the waiter was serving the food, and the water went into my food making everything watery. 

Overall, the food was great, but the service would prevent me from coming back."}

TO TRY: the bruschetta (i always get the pesto, roasted garlic, roasted artichoke and lastly the mozzarella, basil, etc), caprese salad is VERY good and i've tried the white chocolate macadamia cookie with ice cream on top! it was great!

NOT SO GOOD: i found the Mediterranean plate slightly disappointing, as I LOVE hummus and the taste of their hummus fell short and was rather salty for me. they're caesar salad was not one of my favorites either.

other than that, the atmosphere is great and i try to take at least a monthly trip to la bocca for my beloved bruschetta!

P.S. my most recent visit to La Bocca and a check-in on Yelp earned me a free cookie with ice cream on top :O)"}

But damnit, when you can splurge, it just feels nice. I also uploaded pictures of our entrees.

Boyfriend took me here for my birthday and even though I read it wasn't good, I ordered the Seafood Pistou because it just had a ton of seafood that sounded good (salmon, mussels, clams, tuna, something else I can't remember). You know what this dish needs. SOME CHEAP PASTA. Sounds contradictory for a pricey restaurant with high quality meats, I know, but there was so much garlic pesto in the "shallow broth" that I really wanted some pasta to help soak some of that up. It was good, though.

Boyfriend wanted to "try something new" and rather than taking a small step from meat and potatoes, he ordered the seared tuna. WTF. I ended up eating the tuna because he didn't like the texture (I thought, duh), but he liked the sesame noodles it came with. He ate them while he drooled over the filet on mashed potatoes at the table next to us. NEVER AGAIN, I told him. :)

The salmon cakes were good and I enjoyed the salad they were served on. 

I enjoy coming here for lunch because the portions aren't much different for the price, but isn't that the story of lunch v. dinner, anyway?"}

Pizza/pasta plates were well received by all, and there were few leftovers. Lastly, the tiramasu was downed by those who exclaimed, "just a taste". On the downside, i could not hear anyone except those on my elbow -- they need to turn the music down. Also, I felt like I was in coach seating to Europe, but on a butt-numbing wooden chair.

And as always, the service was impeccable, the food fabulous and I love their patio.  I enjoyed the wonderful quiche combination - with yummy pork/chickpea soup.   Others enjoyed their burgers and the cornbread BLT - everything was delicious.  

What is keeping me from giving this location a full 5-stars is two points - one within their control and one they are not able to do anything about. 

I was sad to see their adult version of the PB&J go away - it was so much fun to order and so wickedly good.  I hope they bring it back.  

Part of the appeal of this location is their expansive patio - especially in the beautiful Arizona winter - eating "al fresco" in the thriving Tempe downtown area.  However, a high-rise building is being erected across the street, which totally blocks the winter sun from their patio.  And, although it was a moderate day (mid-60's), we had to ask for two heaters to be brought to the table.   

I will continue to whole-heartedly endorse this fabulous venue, but just  be prepared for a change.  I hope the sun moves north quickly - which will help the early spring visitors."}

We were there on a cool evening but quite comfortable sitting next to the large fire pit on the expansive patio.   My husband and I chose the mussels with harissa and chorizo for a starter.  Probably the most delicious mussels I have ever eaten. The grilled bread was great for dipping into the creamy sauce.  I ordered the mustard glazed salmon with toasted brown rice and baby bok choy. The salmon was well cooked but just a tad overdone for me. I felt that the mustard glaze was just spooned on and not actually part of the cooking process. There was too much of the glaze and it completely overpowered the salmon. The "toasted " rice tasted like plain old brown rice and the overcooked bok choy didn't go well with the other flavors.   My husband ordered the bison meat loaf. A small portion and nothing special. He loves purple potatoes but did not enjoy them as they were puréed to the consistency of baby food.   Disappointing food for that price point.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the mussels were so good (although they could have been bigger). We were there on a Monday night so perhaps the "A" kitchen team was not there but I would hope that food would be consistent no matter when you dine.

House of Tricks, you are my lunch mecca!

Honestly, if I could eat here Monday through Friday for lunch, I would. And what would I order? Their daily quiche. Absolutely. No hesitations. No second thoughts. 

Their quiche of the day is perfection!

I've eaten here twice in a single week. Yes, House of Tricks is simply that awesome. After my 1st visit, I was craving it the very next day. So I made plans to go back that very week. I wanted to try their quiche again. 

House of Tricks is my absolute favorite lunch spot in Tempe!

For $10, you get their quiche of the day, fresh fruit and a soup or salad. 

First quiche was chicken and goat cheese. Wow... That's all I could think to myself. "Wow, Alicia, this is... wow..." 

Second trip I had sausage, mushrooms and Gruyere quiche, which I ordered with their daily soup, a lobster squash concoction. While the soup was really, really good, I was still enamored with their quiche. 

And fresh fruit? C'mon. This is the stuff Lunch Nirvana is made of!

House of Tricks, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you! 

House of Tricks, I love you! I love your quiche! You deserve every single exclamation point in the exclamation point satchel. Seriously!

I would eat inside, outside, at the bar, wherever I could. Yes, I'd eat here every single day. That adds up to a $50 weekly habit... but I bet there's not one quiche I wouldn't like!"}

My chicken was extremely dry.  Like it was cooked three days ago and sat out dry. There was no way this was cooked that night.  I personally never send food back unless I get what I didn't order.  Because obviously they don't cook their chicken to order so I didn't want another dry cold piece of chicken that was cooked more than 24 hours ago.  The pasta was stuck together so it did not cook all that great.  This bothered me less.  Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food, which was disappointing to me.  Should have stuck to one of their salads or Bruchesta's.  The only redeeming thing was the pizza cookie.  Glad I ordered it, or i'd have to stop and get some FillyB's to fill me up from the meal I barely ate.  Honestly I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  There are much better places in the area.

From the pictures, I was worried I would still be hungry after because the plates seems dainty. But I was pleasantly surprised I left completely full. 
I started with the raspberry ice tea. We split the sweet potato goat cheese cakes. It was one of those things where it had some random ingredients and it tasted so good. Then I had the Caesar salad. It was pretty good size and was garlicky as promised. Last I had the harissa mussels as my meal. Wow it was huge and so flavorful. I almost wish I had rice to eat the sauce with because the pieces of bread wasn't enough. 
We ended with splitting the bread pudding. Very good as well.

I've been here a few times and always enjoy the ambiance, food, drinks, and staff. 

House of Tricks is all outdoor seating, so probably not best to come here on a hot 100 degree day (they close down in July). But when the weather is right and you want to enjoy AZ's beautiful outdoors, this is a great place to sit for a while with good company. 

I came here the day before Memorial Day with two of my girlfriends. We split 3 appetizers (Mussels in a curry chorizo sauce with bread, fruit and cheese platter, and baby back ribs). We all had a few cocktails, too. I recommend the Pear cocktail (Grey Goose Pear Vodka, champagne - delicious! but one or two of those and you might want a ride home). My friend had the Spring Chicken cocktail (gin, peach schnapps - very refreshing!)

This is the type of place where you can really sit and enjoy your meal and drinks for a couple hours. There are trees surrounding the tables and bar so there's always shade. Even though it's by ASU, you feel really closed off and private. 

The Executive Chef here is amazing, as well! We met him last time we were here and had to give him props for everything he makes. He completely changes the menu EVERY SEASON so you'll never get bored of this place. I have never tried anything of his that didn't put me in a blissful food coma. 

Keep doing what you're doing, guys! Love everything."}

I kept trying to make eye contact with the servers/hosts but could not seem to get their attention. We were finally seated on the patio, which was very nice and perfect for outdoor dining.

Unfortunately, the service continued to be lacking. We saw our waitress only a few brief times throughout the whole night - once to take our orders, once to give us the dessert menu, and once to collect our money. She was friendly, but the fact remains that she was mostly nowhere to be found. 

Despite the mediocre service, the food was great. We shared the mussels for an appetizer, and they were very large and tasty. I ordered the halibut, which was perfectly cooked. My dad got the pork tenderloin, and my mom had the Thai duck, both of which were fantastic as well. The key lime cheesecake we got for dessert was not so good - it had a strange, trying-too-hard-to-be-different tinge to it, and it was drowning in a sea of raspberry sauce. The coffee was lovely though!

All in all, I would go back to (and recommend) House of Tricks because the food has been fairly consistent in quality and its ambiance is a rare find in Phoenix. I do wish the service was better, especially given the prices. A friendly, present, and attentive waitress would have made my birthday night so much better!"}

I enjoyed the beet salad which was excellent, very fresh and a good size. The flavors were really good. My friend and I split some bruschetta: the smoked prosciuto was good though I couldn't really taste the truffle oil; roasted artichoke, eh, it was just ok; roasted garlic with goat cheese and arugula was excellent. I loved the spicy bite of the arugula with the sweetness of the balsamic. 

I would come back here for another glass of sangria and to try some more menu items. Onnly bad thing was the service was iffy; server was not very friendly and wasn't very attentive. But she did bring the check promptly when asked so not terrible."}

Short version: don't bother with this place.

Long version: stopped in and was told to seat ourselves. Hostess brought out our menus then a while later a waiter came out to take our order. He was extremely aloof, and not at all interested in helping us. He took our orders while leaning casually up against the wall then just left, no interaction at all. He dropped our wine off, again with nothing said. Our pizza arrived burned, dry and pretty flavorless. No one came out to ask how our food was and we had to go searching for some chili flakes and parmesan at the bar.  Then our waiter came out to advise of last call..... We asked for our bill and all of the sudden he was helpful and told us if we needed anything to just "holler". Pretty sure that is how the BEGINNING of waiting a table is supposed to go,not before the table pays and leaves.

Anyways. If I was ever in town again, I would never return here. Easily the most disappointing $50 dinner ever."}

Make reservations. You'd think on a Tue night on a week with no major sporting events or otherwise going on, you'd be able to grab a table without waiting, wrong.

I would recommend trying the mussels as an appetizer.  The sauce has some chorizo in it and it adds the just the right amount of "spice" to the dish.  I would recommend trying the fish of the day or the short ribs.  

This place is perfect for a date, celebration, or happy hour!

Say "hi" to Kirk, the manager, my dear friend when you're there! :)"}

Last night a friend and I went to HOT for a nice dinner while she was in town for a short business trip.  It was a lovely experience.

We started with cocktails. I had the New Old Fashioned which was delicious.  The liquor was infused with vanilla bean and fig and topped with citrus bitters.  So good.  My friend had a margarita that has chili pepper infusion.  She liked her drink too.

We shared the cheese tray, which was excellent.  A nice variety of cheeses, toasty bread, nuts, and grapes.  More than ample portion for two.

We both decided on the short ribs on a bed of white cheese grits.  SO GOOD!  Meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned to perfection.  Will definitely order this again.

When we arrived we were given the choice of inside or outside seating.  As much as we hated to pass up the beautiful outdoor seating area, it was really hot so we opted for inside.  Go glad we did because we were able to linger over our drinks and dinner while staying completely comfortable.

Our waiter was delighted and provided excellent service.

Love House of Tricks!"}

We went because of a recommendation from a good friend. The patio seating was nice but we chose to eat inside because it was a little chilly.

We were seated but it took ten minutes for us to get our drinks. I had to walk back outside to the hostess to ask her if anyone was going to help us. I wonder how long it would have taken if I wouldn't have said anything. I needed to because there is metered parking.

The waiter came by without apologizing for the wait and hurriedly asked for our orders and dashed off. This was a tad irritating.

We ordered the spinach dip to start then I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, and my boyfriend ordered the french dip sandwich.

The appetizer was super delicious! It had roasted poblano in it which gave it a great kick and went well with the toasted baguette.  My sandwich had bacon, goat cheese, fig spread, and arugula on a ciabatta roll. There could have been more goat cheese and fig spread. The grilled chicken was moist but needed more seasoning.The salad that accompanied my meal was fresh with fruit and spinach leaves with a rosemary/balsamic vinaigrette. My boyfriend loves french dip sandwiches but the star of his meal was the au jus dipping sauce not the sandwich.

The jist of this review is that my first impression is a little tainted by the poor service but it evened out with the decent food.

I texted the friend who recommended this place and I told him about the weird service and he replied, "Oh you must be sitting outside." As if this should make a difference? They may have been overstaffed but there plenty of empty tables around us. We might try it again, maybe for dinner. Here's to second impressions!"}

We were having issues picking somewhere because I got off around 10pm and it's hard to find places open late.  Thankfully, La Bocca was open until 12am on a Saturday.  When you first walk in it feels very down to earth, laid back and kind of artsy.  I really loved the designs, it was interesting to look at.  The lady who came to our table was very friendly and got our drinks promptly.  I had the Orange Blossom Martini, delicious!  My boyfriend had something (sorry I can't remember) very strong, but refreshing.  It had the aroma of lime and you can also enjoy the taste of the lime, possibly sugar and very strong alcohol.  The waitress said it had Everclear in it and that's why it was so strong.  We enjoyed the Bruschetta , Pesto Pasta and a 'make your own pizza.'  The whole reason I love this place is the AMAZING Bruschetta !  The flavors were so rich and amazingly put together.  I will definitely be going back here.  The ambiance, drinks, food, customer service was all great.  It's not too pricey, but if you want to enjoy the Bruschetta (pick four) be ready to dish out $12 buck for that appetizer.  We did not get to enjoy the deserts, but they sounded great.  Maybe next time ;).  My pasta had a strong taste of feta, which I didn't mind, but the Bruschetta stole the show for me.

I'll be happy to revisit!"}

Get the grilled chicken sandwich. It's quality meat, and goat cheese, bacon, and fig jam pretty universally take every sandwich from "um, sure" to "oh, yes." The pistachio butter and jelly on a croissant is interesting, but is more of a novelty than a substantial lunch choice. The turkey club was least popular, but this shouldn't be an issue because you're ordering the grilled chicken sandwich, anyway [see beginning of paragraph.]

In terms of ambiance, I'd bring my grandma here before I brought a date, because the environment and the lunch plates are all detail-oriented and dainty, plus the feel is cute and cozy, even in 100+ degree heat. However, if you're dating a grandma, please ignore this section."}

Run on sentences aside, I very much enjoyed this place. We got a bruschetta board and 2 pizzas and the 3 of us left very satisfied. The vibe wasn't stuffy and our waitress was very pleasant. One drawback, we were sat at one of the tables closest to the front door so it was sill fairly warm because of people constantly opening the door and allowing the hot air in. I just ended up drinking a lot of ice water to stay cool. 

I'll most definitely be back, have to try a salad, the anti-pasti appetizer and all the other pizzas!"}

The walls of the restaurant were maroon red. They were decorated with large greyscale abstract paintings and a mosaic of black thick framed photographs from various cultures. Next to the wine bar, there was a screen with the movie Paris, Je T'AiMe playing. There was also Spanish music playing in the background. 

Shortly after we were seated, our server brought us water garnished with a cucumber slice. We couldn't resist from ordering the award winning sangria (the "blanc"). It's interesting that you have a choice of ordering blanc, rojo, or mixed sangria. The Sangria was made from wine, spirits, spices, and fresh fruit. The Blanc sangria was  quite refreshing. It was garnished with pineapple chunks and chopped orange slices. The Rojo sangria tasted like sour cherry. It was garnished with chipped orange slices. For non-alcoholic beverages, I'd recommend the Desert Bloom Iced Tea. It's a local tea that the restaurant brews daily. It's naturally sweet green rooibos tea with floral-earthy tones from notes of cactus essence, cactus petals, and cornflower petals. The tea has a peach and mango flavor.

We were happy with everything we ordered tonight. Every dish was the perfect portion and quite flavorful. Everyone in our party was able get a taste of everything ordered without getting too full.

For appetizers, I'd recommend the Heirloom Beets salad which consisted of diced golden and red beets, served over a slice of green, yellow, and red heirloom tomatoes. It was topped with a bed of arugula and candied walnuts and drizzled with balsamic shallot vinaigrette. Since some of our guests weren't fans of goat cheese, we requested for it to be served on the side.

For pastas, I'd recommend Chicken Limone which consisted of freshly kneed taglietti pasta in a lemon garlic caper sauce. It was topped with roasted chicken, lemon zest, and freshly grated parsley (and possibly other fresh herbs). It was with two slices of tomato based garlic bread and a side salad of your choice. I chose a side Caesar salad which was tossed in a tart Caesar dressing and garnished with sliced grape tomatoes.

For pizzas, I'd recommend adding diced roasted chicken to the Margarita pizza which consisted of crushed San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, olive oil, and basil."}

We came for the Tempe Arts Fair,http://www.yelp.com/biz/tempe-arts-festival-tempe#hrid:mFf-pIdZ8gGArDYHL4-YgA  but decided to checkout the Happy Hour at La Bocca.  For the last three years, this restaurant and it's Chef Julian Wright is all anyone can talk about.  It feels like Phoenix's New Times writes about him at least once a week. LOL 

AMBIANCE:
Mill Avenue continues to change with the times and reinvent itself -- something we like!  We chose to sit outside and people watch since it was still early.  Inside the restaurant has a modern 1940s feel which is really very nice.

CLIENTELE:
Here's an interesting category.  Mill Avenue and the restaurants are a mixture of older college kids from ASU (21+), along with Alumni of all ages.  You also have people like us who just like the vibe of the area.

MENU:
They've made some changes in their Happy Hour menu, but everything is still excellent! Most items from the bar are $3.00 during HH, that also includes shots.  So it really is a watering hole. We really like their Rojo Sangria, and it's a very reasonable at $22.00 for a 750 ml Carafe, btw.
http://laboccapizzeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-WINTER-WINE-LIST.pdf

SERVICE:
Is a tag team affair, but our server Alex was outstanding.  He stayed on top of things and came back to check in from time to time.  When we mentioned Yelp, he told us how customers have written some very nice reviews about the restaurant and one had even mentioned his service.  Well Alex, here's your second nod.  You were great, and we would come back to your section anytime! 

FOOD:
The food at LaBocca is mostly Italian with some tweaks to the concept.  A good example is their Harvest Chop Salad for $8.00 which we enjoyed.  There's a nominal $2.00 up-charge for the split, but it was subtle and very nice. It had a light Dijon mustard vinaigrette dressing, over tubetti pasta, romaine lettuce, bacon, tomatoes and some blue cheese.  It was delicious and the blue cheese was very mild, almost Gorgonzola-ish.  

Next we had their famous Margarita pizza was $9.00 (see photo). La Bocca is known for their pizzas. It was made with some crushed San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella.  It also had a rough cut of basil leaves on top.  We liked it a lot, but also enjoy the pizza at Pomo's on Scottsdale Road for the real Neopolitan stuff. 

For dessert we shared each others -- Tiramisu $ 5.00 (photo) and Fresh Mint Chip Ice Cream $6.00.  A nice ending to a wonderful meal.
http://laboccapizzeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/labocca-urban-pizzeria-lunch-dinner-menu.pdf

PRICES:
Our bill came to $52.00 after taxes, but before gratuities.  It would have been less if we kept to the HH wine list but the carafe of Sangria (photo) was too good to pass up.

Enjoy!  We'll be back.

I guess people do really like them on Yelp!"}

I've dined here a few times, and each time has been amazing, the pizzas are all so delicious. I think I've had a slice of each one and every one of them is amazing. You can also custom order a pizza. I like their sausage pizza but add ricotta on it. Yummers!

The sangrias is what makes me come back and think fondly of this place. Get a pitcher or two and share with a friend. Such a great time. I recommend their red over the white, simply because the red is more flavorful and not too sweet. 

The prices are extremely affordable. Being close to ASU campus I guess you have to be if you want to survive catering to the college student budgets. I love the atmosphere. Very young, hip, but not divey like a typical pizza joint near a college campus. The service is average. Not great, but never bad service. It's always crowded and they seem to hire mostly college kids, but the service is always pretty good.

The parking isn't the best, but it's expected when you're hanging on busy and crowded Mill. One of my must do dining experiences if your down this way."}

I have to agree with the previous review on the Postino's menu rip off, (including the pizza) it is almost exactly the same. That being said the food was decent.  A friend and I shared a pizza with sausage, caramelized onions and mushrooms.  We both were impressed with the wood fire crust, it was pretty delicious. The sangria was so so, it tasted as though the fruit had been marinating a bit too long and was about to go sour. Our service was also good, we were in and out in under an hour, and for noon on Mill that says a lot. This place gets a solid 3 stars. Nothing special, but not too bad.

*************UPDATE***********
They have no food specials for happy hour! Who are they trying to compete with? Cafe Boa, Mucho Gusto, Bamboo Club?.. Oh no wait those places (all within walking distance) have happy on food. I can understand the sangria not on special.. But a place that does pizza and bruchetta with no food specials gimmeabreak!

They have some good happy hour specials that I think are from 3-5:30.  We got the arugula salad which was A) beautiful and B) delicious.  The pizza is traditional Italian Neapolitan pizza - also very good.  The service was good, not great.  Definitely felt like the waitress was rushing us through our dinner.  The only reason why I'd give them a four star instead of five was the menu seemed pretty standard. I was hoping to be wowed by a new culinary experience.  But at the end of the day I do plan on coming back!"}

I was really excited on my way there, but left feeling underwhelemd. 

For me, it felt a little big, commercial, the decor was kinda cheesy - think red leather chairs, Pier1 Important wall sconces, even a "VIP" looking lounge in red velour. Hardly, original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic "wine bar" in my opinion. If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place (call me a snob, whatever). Let's talk about the wine list at this "wine bar" --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good. 

We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine? 

Don't get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a "fancy date night place" if I were still in college. I'd go again with girlfriends but won't be racing back with my husband. 

I wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place. Ambiance and service are good - not great. Oh, and the music could use some updating. The playlist was... eh... interesting 

Maybe it's my love of Postino or maybe its because I was on Mill Avenue I was instantly judging the place."}

The server was not as attentive as I would expect in this type of establishment. I was often helped by other servers. I think 4 different people cared for our table in 90 minutes. The ambiance of the place was very nice. You feel a good vibe walking through the door. It was a little loud, but its Saturday night. What can you say?The food was lacking in a few things that would make it great. I ordered the goat cheese and pear salad. The portion size was good, but the pears were sliced into large pieces that I chose to break down. They would have been better sliced very thin on a mandolin, or simply in smaller pieces. I had the porco pizza. This had pulled pork, Serrano chilies, and caramelized onions. The size is more than enough. The hand tossed crust is very good, but could have benefited with a brushing of olive oil before serving, or at least having some olive oil on the table, and I could do it myself. It was pretty dry. Actually, the whole pizza was dry. The flavor of the pizza would have been great if there was sauce, like barbecue, or anything really. Apparently, their pizzas don't have sauce. To me you should call that a flat bread, and even that is pushing it. If you are looking for a great place for pizza, Mellow Mushroom is across the street. Wine bar or bruschetta board? Postino is still #1 in my book."}

The prosciutto and truffle oil plank is my favorite, and the use of heirloom tomato's whenever they are in season is a very nice, and tasty touch. Drinks are excellent and fresh, and the staff has always been friendly. 
   My favorite part though, is the cozy, unpretentious atmosphere. From college students to working professionals, you really won't feel out of place whether you're in casual-wear or gussied up for a date. 
   If you are coming here expecting to be surrounded by the plastic of Scottsdale and the attitude to match, you will probably be dissapointed. But, if you are looking for a cozy relaxing place to enjoy a meal, or go on a date, this is a perfect spot."}

They have a great selection of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. My favorite lunch with a girl friend is splitting a salad and pizza at La Bocca. 

Happy hour specials are great, they have fantastic Sangria and appetizers. But honestly I think it's the atmosphere that makes this place work so well. It's never too loud, always simultaneously classy and laid back. So no matter your purpose, you can fit in. Business lunches and happy hours with friends can happen in the same location easily.

I had heard great things about this place and wanted to give a fellow ASU alum some business. I walked in and the hostess was not very friendly. In fact, I thought she was kind of rude. Maybe it was just me. I felt very awkward and uncomfortable for some reason but could not explain why. The restaurant itself is very pretty and hip. They also have a nice outside seating area leading to Mill and that wraps around 6th Street. 
   My experience did improve after a little while. I ordered the Truffle pizza. I asked them to add sausage because I saw it was real and Schrieners to boot, not that fake crumbly junky stuff. I also ordered a side salad. Well you can't do too much to kill a side salad so that was fine. The waiter and another gentleman staff member ( perhaps a manager) were great while I waited for my pizza. It kind of made up for the hostess!!!!! I would get rid of her. Okay maybe a chat first. lol
   Well, then the pizza comes out and it is slightly burnt on top. Owhhhhhh, I hate when my pizza is burnt in any shape or form. I know that is the hip new way to eat pizza but not for me. I don't get it. Not this New York Gal. I like it with no burnt marks at all. I was all set to send it back when I decided to try it first.( I rarely send food back since I have a severe issue with waste) I have to tell you I thought it was very good. The spinach meshed perfect with this creamy goat cheese they use for a unique, yummy flavor. I really enjoyed it. I was not that crazy about the burnt crust though thus the 4 stars instead of five. I might come back again this Saturday after the run to try some other things. 
   What really saved the day was the nice waiter. He talked with me for a long while. He told me all about the owner and his other establishments. We talked shop, which means food. Teehee! The waiter seemed very glad to have me for a costumer. I like that. I wish I knew his name. I usually note that but after a long week of  testing I guess I just wanted to stuff my face with good pizza. lol! Manga!"}

I'm a big advocate of promoting a good spot so I've recommend this place to a number of people and every single one of them has gotten back to me and thanked me for the suggestion because they enjoyed there meal so much. 

Highlights:
Location- Located on Mill St with an outdoor patio that lends to a lot of great people watching or just hanging out. The inside has a different environment and is more intimate, artsy feeling. 

Service- One the best I've experience in a while, everyone is very attentive and friendly. All the servers are extremely knowledgeable about all their wines and how to properly pair them.  

Food- I've gotta say they sure do love goat cheese here.  They have these scrumptious 'Brushetta Planks' that are simply beyond. You can mix and match to try different combinations but they are great to start with or if you're only there for drinks & apps.  As I have tried a lot my favorites are:
   * Plank: Smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil
   * Salad: Goat Cheese and Pear Salad, with dried cranberries and walnuts
   * Pizza: Truffle Mushroom Pizza, with goat cheese and spinach (absolutely incredible)
  * Pasta: Cavatappi poblano alfredo, with roasted chicken and  sautéed mushrooms

Drinks- I have found my perfect drink for this hot AZ weather POMAGRANITE MARGARITA it is so cool and refreshing. The perfect thing to cool you off on a hot summer day. 

* Perk- I came here once on a Sunday night and all wine bottles were 50% off. If I remember correctly they do this every Sunday."}

15 minutes later and still, no one came to our table. We watched 3 waiters, the hostess and the manager go up to the other 4 tables in the patio except for ours. At this point we asked the hostess where our waiter was. She was surprised nobody came by our table but said she would get them. Another 5 minutes goes by and still more waiters attend the other tables but nobody approaches us. At this point we got up, found the manager, and told him we were leaving. He said there was a miscommunication with the waiters. I still don't understand how NONE of the waiters/manager/hostess managed to walk past us multiple times without asking us if we had been helped. 

The food probably would have been good but with this kind of service, not worth it. Never been this disappointed with a restaurant's service before. Get it together guys!"}

The inside of the restaurant looks pretty cozy and contemporary. They specialize in pizza. We came during their happy hour--only on select drinks. We were given time to look at the menu... a lot of time! It was as if they forgot about us. Impossible, because the restaurant was filled probably 15-20% capacity.

After ~15-20 minutes of reading the menu (probably two or three times) we ordered (finally!). I got the bocca trio which had 3 different types of meat--that was pretty good! My friend got the margarita--impossible to mess up. My other friend got the Garlic which, in my opinion, tasted TOO garlicy. I only had one slice of her pizza and told myself no more.

I think the reason why this is a 3 star review instead of a 4 star review is because the waitress was just very cold towards us. I don't know if she was just having a bad day. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't mean or anything, but just the air around her felt very unwelcoming. 

Try it out? Maybe you'll get a more happier wait staff when you go"}
