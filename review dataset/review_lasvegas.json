I expected a ridiculously cheesy, over the top, fat-laden meal.. and that is what I got! Yup, its' gimmicky, yup, it's high calories, but I feel like all of that should come as no surprise! 

I think the "theme" if you will is entertaining and fun. Wearing a hospital gown was pretty funny (you get to keep it if you let the nurses spank you!), watching the nurses dole out spankings was pretty hilarious, and I loved how the bill had "medical procedures rendered" printed on it. 

Our service was great. Friendly nurse. Food came relatively quickly. No complaints!

We started our meal with the chocolate butter cream shake and added a "shot" of whipped cream vodka. It turns out the "shot" was actually 3.5 shots, thus earning the drink the title of "strongest frozen drink on Fremont". I don't know if they really are the strongest drink on Fremont, but I do know it was the TASTIEST frozen drink on Fremont. If you are childish enough to enjoy whipped cream vodka (I am!), then you will definitely appreciate the delicious combination! There was no pat of butter in my shake (which was fine by me). 

We split the single bypass (1/2 pound) and an order of fries. I LOVE that they cook their fries in lard (as all fries should be cooked!), and damn were they delicious. Perfectly crisp. The burger was very good as well. Definitely not "best burger in Vegas" material, but a great burger. 

Overall, please don't come here if you don't have a sense of humor and don't enjoy high fat food. The food tastes much better if you are drunk - in fact eating a burger wearing a hospital gown should probably only be done while intoxicated."}

The only way to sum up the Heart Attach Grill is kitschy, but fun.  Unfortunately, their food doesn't live up to their slogan of "taste worth dying for."

We came in expecting good food, but not gourmet.  Worst burger and fries we had ever tasted.  To start, the burgers were chard to a wonderfully grey color. I think they were as well done as leather.  They lacked seasoning and the bacon was as chewy as they precooked stuff found in the back of a supermarket.  Lard fries should be crisp and delicious, full of flavors not found at fast food or your normal burger stops. No.  They were boiled in lard, soggy and mushy, and, like the burger, lacked any seasoning and flavor.  I would have preferred to eat at a McDonald's.

People giving this place anything over 2 stars need to reevaluate what they consider to be a good burger, because better food can be had at a "roach coach"."}

Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the "bypass" and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) "bypass".  

When a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and "win" a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.  

A close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.    

The novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it."}

Ok, yes I understand it's Vegas and it's fun. I'll give it that. The gowns are fun to dress up in- they do very well with the theme. That is how they got one star from me.

However, they advertise "taste worth dying for".... WTF are they smoking? There is SO MUCH potential for this place if they had decent food. 

I've had my share of fatty foods. They usually taste better than skinny people food. If all fast food tasted like this, I think the obesity epidemic would be solved. No one would want to eat this crap. 

This place was an embarrassment to fatty foods everywhere. Other places'  fries that are fried in animal fat= amazing. Why? Because they are crispy and delicious. They are fried first in oil and then in duck fat. HAG misses the extra step and just fries their fries in lard in lard. Lard burns at too low of a temperature and cannot "FRY" fries.  HAG fries are limp, soggy, and burned ( AND luke warm). Gross.

The burger... 59 cent dry stale bun + overcooked basically unseasoned meat + bacon that was chewy and luke warm (somehow it was stale too) = disappointment. 

It's not even a tiny bit delicious. It is disgusting and they don't even try. The whole restaurant is constantly advertising how amazing the food is and how it's food worth dying for. No- it's definitely worth avoiding though."}

The food, the costumes, the service, the attitudes, all of it. Back in Chandler and Tempe, it was a hedonist paradise. 

It was campy before with its sexy nurses and absurdly large burgers and the policy about getting to eat for free if a person weighs more than 350 pounds. Yeah, this all carried over. 

Now you are required to wear a hospital gown they provide and if you don't finish your meal, you're forced to stand in front of a camera while one of the nurses strikes you with a paddle from behind, recording your every facial expression. Honestly, it at times got disturbing. The loud WHACKS against people's backsides would pervade throughout the room while everyone watched and strangers shot video with their phones. It wasn't playful spanking; these ladies were really winding up and letting the paying customer who dared utter, "I'm full," have it.  

There's much more alcohol than there was before with the option of getting it in prescription bottles, IV drips, and syringes. This is probably the only fun aspect that I'm glad they achieved here, which I didn't see when it was one state over. Granted, it's definitely not cheap to drink here. 

Again, the food just wasn't up to snuff. It didn't have the same flavors, it was greasier (which I guess they were aiming for), and things like the chili fries were overdone and dried out. Maybe they figured the chili would disguise it or compensate? 

It's pretty cheesy and if you're easily offended, steer clear of it, but with sensibilities like those what would you be doing walking around Vegas?"}

The fries are cooked to lard perfection and the shakes are so delish. I love the atmosphere and theme of the restaurant. You get admitted and have to wear a hospital gown. If you don't finish (burger at least) the seductive friendly nurses spanky you. Dr. Jon is a true genius and visionary. This restaurant has the potential to last years in Fabulous Las Vegas. Especially being at the center of Neonopolis on Fremont. The location is perfect. The play on art and movie posters throughout the restaurant is a site to see itself. I've never had a disappointing experience here. The staff is always very friendly and enthusiastic about their jobs. I usually gotta come alone cause my friends aren't fond of this spot.

We skipped that option. One poor guy got the sh*t beat out of him because he said after the 1st spank that it didn't hurt at all. Well after she was done with him he looked like he could cry. Everyone is watching while they do this too. They have cute "movies" playing of the waitresses reenacting popular shows. The star wars one was the best. The décor is clever as well. Two single burgers, one fry and two waters we were out of there for about $26.00. Great price for the food and the entertainment. Later I didn't feel like I over ate either.

The nurses spank them really hard - it's funny to see who yelps in pain and who just takes it. It looks like they don't spank women - the woman at the table next to us couldn't finish her burger and our waitress assured her she wouldn't get spanked but her husband would have to take it for her!

Just a good time with great friends which is always a treat regardless of what we are eating.  At best, I was expecting a fast food burger chain type burger...at worst a barely palatable "looks kinda like meat, doesn't really taste like it" burger. Boy, was I way the heck wrong!

It was a mighty fine burger. E and I came to the decision that in our burger eating lives thus far, we've had a majority of mediocre burgers,  a few downright not so good burgers, and even less good to great burgers. This was suprprisingly good. Moist, meaty, tasty, and all on a really great bun from a local bakery. I thought it was a potato bun but our nurse (server) didn't know for sure. Their chili chese fries were a great compliment to the burger, shoestring fries with what seemed like a 'no bean hot dog kinda chili' chili. I'm not sure what brand was used but that too was yummy; one of the better ones.

The floor entertainment was hilarious and I'm sure painful. Although, do you really feel any pain if you are swimming in an alcoholic fog? The tiny nurses literally wound up to swat a fellow three times for not finishing his meal. One even swatted the guy on the same cheek  each time - ouch!

All in all a grand time...good burger...great friends. Next time someone suggests venturing out this way, I will not be a naysayer."}

Hernan N. comes home from school and turns on the TV.On comes one of the greatest animated shows of all time, Animaniacs.The 10-year old me follows the adventures of Yakko, Wakko and Dot(plus various other characters.Pinky & The Brain!The Goodfeathers!) everyday with delight.

Right now you are probably thinking to yourself, "Why the fuck is this guy talking about cartoons?"

There was a nameless character on the show who just happened to be a buxom blonde nurse.Whenever Yakko would come across said nurse he would shout out his catchphrase, "HELLOOOOO NURSE!"

That began my obsession/fetish/whatever with girls in nurses outfits.I'm not talking about those lame scrubs that nurses wear nowadays(screw you male nurses for ruining the way that nurses dress now), but the white outfits and hat little white hat with the red cross on it.To this day, whenever I come across an attractive woman that phrase echoes through my head.I sometimes find myself imagining what a girl will look like in a nurse's outfit before deciding to approach her.Relationships have been ruined due to this obsession(why aren't more women into roleplaying?).Anyway...

The Present:

I find out there is a new restaurant opening up on Fremont Street that serves frighteningly unhealthy food and the waitresses are dressed like nurses....I'm there, dude.

I walk in and the 1st thing I see is a short, busty blonde dressed as a nurse.With every fiber of my being I fight off the urge to yell out, "HELLOOOO NURSE!"

She puts a hospital gown on me and I am seated at the bar, attended to by a lady wearing surgeon scrubs.The menu says. "Taste worth dying for."

I didn't feel like going overboard for my 1st time, so I ordered the Single Bypass(1/2 lb burger), Lard Fries(wtf!?) and a Coke.While I waited on my food I chatted up the bartender and asked her how often 350+ lbs people come to get a free burger.She told me at least 1 a day, and one night there was 6.Minutes after I inquired, a hefty fellow came in and got on the scale.This contender stood at 6'5 and weighed in at 357 lbs.America, fuck ya.

The fries were pretty damn good.I have no clue what lard is supposed to taste like but it works well with fries.Apparently, the bun and meat of the burger are also coated with lard.Lardopalooza up in here.

Something about this burger was just not right.The cheese looked like it had been placed onto the burger the moment it had been handed to me, the onions had the texture of worms(Yes, I've eaten worms before.)Normally when one bites into a really good burger, you get that burst of flavor in your mouth that makes you pity vegetarians.I did not experience that here.

As I continued to eat, I gazed up at the video wall and saw the sign(Throwing out an Ace of Base reference).The video shows the owner in a doctor's outfit and two nurses shopping for supplies at a Sam's Club/Costco warehouse store.He pushes the 2 nurses around on a cart and comes to the meat section.Now it all makes sense.They buy all their product from a fucking Costco!sigh...

I wanted to like this place, i really did.The staff is great, the theme and atmosphere is cool but the food is just not good."}

All in all its a tourist trap with decent food (kinda above average) and a great location, if nothing else you should try it once."}

I got good health insurance and a gym membership, I'm covered. Right outside the restaurant is an old-school ambulance and a sign on top that says "350LBS EATS FREE". A glutton's open invite to a free, well, heart attack. People have had heart attacks while eating here - surprise! CASH only!!!

Servers are dressed up as slutty nurses and the guys that work there are dressed up as doctors. Diners put on a hospital gown. If you look like you weigh about 350lbs, they'll weigh you so you can eat for free and get heavier.

Burgers: single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass or quadruple bypass (one patty, 2, 3, 4 patties) cooked in lard and you have an option to add bacon. Fries are of course, cooked in lard.

Drinks: soda, milkshake with butter and alcohol.

Both times I've been here, I've gotten a single bypass with bacon, fries and a water. I don't care if it's toilet water, there's no way I'm drinking butter! The patty is cooked well-done (boo!), the bread is nice and soft, and the bacon is crispy. The fries are made with real potatoes...woohoo! It's alright...

Would I take anyone I love and care about here? Heck no! I'd rather bring them to one of those trendy yuppie chow places! :))"}

I disagreed with him because obesity and health problems due to unhealthy diet are serious social problems in the US so I found their marketing strategy repulsive and offensive. But, I tried to be a bit lighthearted about the issue during our vacation. I have to admit that this place did an excellent marketing job (e.g., eating free if you weigh over 350 pounds, interesting posters on the walls, waitresses' nurse uniform, customers wearing a hospital gown). HOWEVER, after all, this is a restaurant where people go eat. After looking at the menu, there was nothing I wanted to eat there. My husband ordered a chilly hot dog with french fries and soda. The food came out, and it was disgusting. French fries were all burnt. My husband took two bites and he couldn't eat it, and I didn't blame him. Who could? We saw a young guy who got spanked by a waitress because he didn't finish his burger as a punishment. Basically, we paid $20 as an admission fee to this restaurant for the entertainment. This place did an excellent job to stand out, but really needs to work on their food. Come on...how can you mess up hog dogs and fries??? Marketing alone can get you so far."}

They don't take credit cards, nope not that one, or that one. No matter how many you pull out, it's just not happening. Because the are a cash only establishment! We didn't know and came in, but luckily found an ATM around the corner. So please don't come unless you have cash with you. Avoid that ATM fee. The menu is pretty basic, a nurse will bring you it. You choose a burger depending on the topping and patties you want. As well as any extras such as drinks and fries. And the Doctors cook it to perfection. Eat, keep your gown on until a nurse takes it off, and finish your food. There are two reasons for this...The first, there's no take out here. You either eat it or leave it. If you can't finish it, reason two: You'll be punished! A few slaps on the butt by a gorgeous nurse sounds nice. Until you end up like me, I wasn't even able to finish a regular by-pass burger. So I was given the paddle and trust me they don't hold back on those who can't finish their food! But at least they give you a nice hug afterwards~ makes you forget the sting on your behind. If you just want a spanking, I'm sure you'll find the nurses more then eager to satisfy that  curiosity."}

We did, and it was a riot. 

I'm not a crazy burger fan, but this place was highly entertaining. We got a seat right by the slapping bar where people got their butts smacked when they don't finish their food (and those girls don't hold back either). That's enough motivation to clean up your plate.

The decor is cleverly done too. The TV plays a variety of music videos, some even customized to the Heart Attack Grill, including one "wtf?" one with a little person and Ron Jeremy lip-synching to "Summer Lovin'" from Grease. 

I love the little menu touches too. If you ask for lettuce they say "we don't have anything green". They don't serve diet drinks either because, why bother? They DO have cane sugar soda which was actually really cool, and somewhat ironic because people would argue real sugar might even be healthier than the usual High Fructose Corn Syrup. If you order wine it comes in an IV and the receipt lists tax as "government theft". It's all very clever.

The burgers themselves were actually quite impressive, even the dinky one-patty burger. For $10 it's actually a reasonable deal considering you'll pay that much anywhere else, and the burgers are a good size. You can easily split a burger if you're worried about not finishing one. I got fries too and even though they were fried in deep lard, they didn't really taste any different.

I'm glad I went, but I don't see myself going back again anytime soon. It's probably not a place you'll go regularly (unless you are over the 350 lb mark). Also keep in mind that it is CASH only and they do not let you bring in outside drinks, including water."}

What went wrong or what could be done better: For a 1/2 pound patty, the burger themselves are dry & overcooked........ for this kind of price, I want a dripping, juicy burger, which these are not. The fries are of the skinny kind, which I feel don't really show off the flavor of the lard or the potato.

On the good side, The whole wait staff was very friendly & the turnaround time from seating to food on the table was very fast, also the whole concept of the diner was fun & well thought out. A great place to take non-foodie out of towners, to show them what Vegas is to many people.....or if you like 5 Guys Burgers, you will love Heart Attack Grill burgers."}

Look at the name of the place and you'll find your answer that this is an UNHEALTHY place to eat.  It's part of the gimmick and as this is in Vegas, it's a good tourist attraction that is made to go against the politically correct attitude regarding obesity in today's society.  They advertise on their windows some of the most politically incorrect deals:  Morbidly obese people over 350 pounds eat for free.  And yes, they have cigarettes on their menu, but only unfiltered.  

As soon as you walk in, scantily-clad waitresses in nurse uniform greet you and put a hospital apron around you.  You'll see a scale in the middle of the room and can get the nurses to weigh you, if you're near the 350 lb threshold. You're met with music from the 70's and get to take a look at their pro-obesity menu.

Again, these meals are not meant for its taste, but I take it that they try to make everything as fattening and unhealthy as possible to fit the style.  The menu is simple and the burgers come in four different sizes: A single, double, triple, and quadruple with each patty being 1/2 a lb!  I got a single 1/2 lb hamburger (they do not allow you to share any of the bigger burgers) and this was definitely the tastiest thing on the menu. I also got a ButterFat(this is the actual name) shake, fries, and a coke. The burger comes with a thick slice of cheese, tomatoes,  grilled onions, and about 5 strips of bacon.  No vegetables here at all!  

Wasn't a big fan of the fries though.  Probably because they proudly proclaimed that they were doused in animal lard before being fried.  It was just too soggy and was as if i were chewing on a soft block of cooking oil.  

The shake wasn't all too good either.  They use only cream and garnish is with a slice of butter on top.  I understood why it was called ButterFat though.  Because it was like eating a mashed up stick of butter.  I couldn't eat it, neither could anyone else that I came with

I did like their old school styled Coke though, where they use a glass bottle with actual sugar instead of corn syrup.  Really sugary, but delicious.  I did notice that it was just imported from Mexico however.  No harm in that though.

So my suggestion is if you come here, don't put your hopes on having a good meal.  Come with some friends, take some pictures, and get ready to play along.  And the experience is what earns this place three stars.  Good setting and overall mediocre food (but delicious burgers)."}

They have the strongest daiquiri, cigarette candy, animal-fat fries, etc. Yeah, I don't mind indulging on those things in moderation but when I do, it better be damn good. The burger was so bland, I asked for a side of pickles to help slither that overcooked mess down my throat but the owner doesn't like pickles so he does not offer it in his restaurant. Pffft!

The only thing this place has going for them is it's gimmicky, touristy and tacky. I highly doubt they have any repeat customers besides the morbidly obese that get to eat for free. But then again those guys have been dropping like flies up in there."}

They dress you up in hospital gowns, the food is directed towards the theme as well as the alcohol. 
The waitresses at this restaurant love there job you can tell.I had an AMAZING waitress named Rianna who I would recommend to anyone who is going to talk to her. She was so down to earth and wonderful. 
They do Karaoke there as well which isn't the main attraction and just kind of added but it is okay. I also don't know how I feel about congratulating people who are over 350 pounds with a free meal but it was cool seeing people get weighed and the scale. 
I didn't eat but all they have is burgers and fries. Instead I decided to stick to drinks. I love that the Jello shots are in an actual syringe and are huge! I love that the only option you can get is red for the blood. My Mom got wine and the only option is to get a bottle of wine in an IV bag so that is what she got!

I can buy a bottle of water on the bridges n bring it with me next time I guess lol.

Overall service/food quality were par at best, and they were slow.  Burgers were hammered and Im pretty sure our waitress was too.  She spent most of her time wiping down the same table, over and over, or just kinda lookin off into space.  Fries were not good, so no loss on the fry bar.

If i were rating strictly on the food, at best they would get 2 stars.  

Service was okay, not particularly stellar.  They do make you agree to the "rules" before you are allowed into the restaurant.

The milk shake was the best part of the meal, and i am not a big fan of ice cream or milkshakes in general.  The burger (a single bypass with bacon) was huge, but tasteless.  The onion rings were doughy and undercooked.  The hot dog one of our party ordered was huge, and probably the biggest success of the meal.

We saw three individuals weigh in over 350 pounds during our meal, which was enough to make me lose my appetite.  I only managed 4 bites of the burger, but got out without a spanking.

It's fun to say we've been here, but certainly won't go back, and i can only recommend it based on the kitschy idea."}

HAHA 

This is definitely a novelty place, I don't think I could eat here to many times, if at all again. 

If your over 350lbs you get your meal for free. LOL

So my friend ordered a Triple Burger with everything and I ordered a Double Burger with everything. In addition, we ordered the chili fries and there hot dog which seemed like 2lbs. Everything on it, has chili, cheese, onions and tons of bacon. 

This was a mistake, we could have easily split the double burger. My buddy ate about a 3/4 of the triple which was a great accomplishment, each patty seemed like 1/3 of a lbs, if not more. Very tall and big, big burgers. 

I ate almost half of my burger, for me it was a little too meaty, but was pretty good overall. The hot dog was really good, we split that. I could have had half of the hot dog and been perfect. But we went there to be pigs and try everything there. I had maybe one fry as I could not eat anymore. 

You can't customize your burger, you can only leave ingredients off, I wanted chili on the side, but they said they couldn't do that. The chili looks like it can cause some serious damage, next day in the bathroom, just saying. HaHa

So if you go there, you can easily split a burger with someone, unless you are a super eater, then I recommend getting a burger just for yourself. 

But for the novelty of it, you should try one burger on your own.. They make you wear hospital gowns when your eating in there, this is kind of funny and strange at the same time, but it's going along with the theme of everything. 

They were spanking people in there that didn't eat all their food, it was quite humorous as they really spank them hard, a paddle broke when I was in there. LOL

I will definitely go back there with someone who has never been there, for the experience."}

If you don't believe that McDonalds makes the best fries in the known universe, then you probably believe that soccer is,actually, a sport. We've eaten a lot of fries across the U.

What makes this place attractive is the experience. It starts off with a scale outside the front door to weigh yourself; you know what kind of food you're getting into. Right when you enter, they put you in a hospital gown and tag you a with medical wrist band. Heart Attack has a Quentin Tarantino type twist to a medical facility, but with a food emphasis theme. There are nice artwork everywhere that changes famous pics to their own food version (look at some of the photos that people have taken). The waitresses dress up as hot nurses and the guy behind the bar, looks like a doctor. Alcoholic shots come in prescription bottles. Portions here are huge! They have up to a Octuple Bypass Burger (8 X 1/2 lbs beef paties, lettuce, red onions, cheese, gourmet sauce, tomato, and 40 bacon slices optional). Chili dog tastes like the chili burger except with a big hot dog meat of course. Fries are deep fried and lard and just taste greasy; chili fries are even more greasy. They even put a slice of butter in your shakes. Be careful what you order though because if you don't finish your food, they will spank you! No sharing allow except for the smallest level items and they will hit you really hard with a wooden paddle, 3 times :/. Being "elite", of course I finished my burger/hotdog ;). A girl yelled out for her mommy, a guy ran and almost cried after being spanked. Overall, a fun place to visit and check out when in Vegas."}

I expected it to be all gimmick, but I was pleasantly surprised that I did in fact enjoy the burger and fries. 

I only had the single bypass, but others had the triple with bacon. Bun to meat ratio is quite good on the single. Great cheese and carmelized onions. My only complaint is that you have no choice on the temperature, all burgers are well done. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but I'd never request one well done. Considering its how this one comes it's pretty good. The bacon is very good if you choose to get it. Fries remind me of those I got as a kid. I prefer crisp and fluffy on the inside, but while these are a bit limp they have great flavor. I didn't have the shake, but a friend did. It was so filling he only finished half and had no room for his burger. It's thick like custard and the pat of butter is just a square that can easily be taken off. 

I expected my visit to be a one time deal, but I would return. Note that it is cash only. A single bypass with bacon and fries will cost less than eleven bucks. Don't forget a drink and tip.

Come with a big appetite and sense of humor. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}

But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE."}

You are given a wrist band and a hospital gown when you walk in and if you dont finish your food you can get a spanking from a "hot nurse"  the wine comes in an IV bag and they have shoy glasses that look like pill bottles.

NOTE: THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY.

If you've heard about the Heart Attack Grill you know it's all about the experience, catering to those who enjoy over-the-top gimmicks.

The gimmick is that you are being prepped for some sort of surgical procedure (a bypass if you order a burger). The servers, all females, are dressed in provocative nurses attires, and fit you with a gown before taking you to your table.

The place is decorated with parody movie posters like, "a few good burgers" and "burger nights", as well as some politically incorrect slogans. 80s music plays while their videos are displayed of several tv's, while other tv's show some silly/campy videos made by the staff.

The menu is pretty simple, burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, and shakes. The only diet drink you'll get here is water, bottled only. Coke product are available in the glass bottles that you don't see around frequently.

The food isn't great, but prices are reasonable."}

As far as the people in the place, they let me take pictures and were really friendly... That kind of speaks volumes in itself that I wasn't even giving them money and they were just overall very nice.  Maybe if I become a super fat guy I'll eat here.. you know.. to end it all.

Sodas only come in glass bottles and wine comes in an i.v beer comes in a glass. And no lite beer or brand beer. All beer they make. Waitress's dress up as nurses and doctors. If you are over 350 your burger is free. They have a scale. If you don't want to get spanked then you have to sing Karaoke. Over all this place is great and I would go back."}

Talk about a place with giant weight scales, hospital gowns for its consumers, waitresses in skimpy nurse outfits, XL wheelchairs, witty pop art that grace the walls and an unbelievable shout out to all 350lb heavy-weighters who can dine for free! Sounds like fun... Sounds like Vegas!  With a name like "HAG", I'm definitely not dinging them for how much fat is packed into their food.  Coming out of this joint in a state of food-coma and lard oozing out of your pours is a given.  Call me self-righteous, but I'm dinging them because I felt that there was no content that backed their concept. 

I would expect that the unhealthiest burger known to mankind would also be the tastiest.. but their claim to fame simply did not meet my expectations.  The burger bun was stale and dry, not even a trace of flavor could be found on the patty and the burger altogether along with the grilled onions, bacon and cheese was a $7 bunch o' bull. Another on my hit list was the fries (deep fried in lard) with cheese and chili.  Again, I have no animosity against the lard.. it was the fact that they had the nerve to call the item "chili-cheese fries"!  The chili had the texture of diarrhea and the oil drenched, browned, curdled fries were more saturated in lard then fried.  Once again, not a trace of flavor.  If you are coating your meal with catsup and mustard, you know you have a problem.  Props to their extensive beer line-up, but if you are not into drinking, your only choices are glass bottled coca-cola and/or bottled water which will run you about $3+.  

The service was good, quick and easy.. but if you are in a skimpy nurses outfit dressing your patients in hospital gowns, I would've expected a little bit more enthusiasm from the servers as they are constantly bombarded with an array of one-liners from the customers like, "Hellllloooo Nurse! Do I need to bend down for this examination?" But they themselves seemed bored out of their minds as if one too many puns came along their way.  Once again.. Flavorless. One and done!"}

This place is pure marketing genius.  If you're reading this review, and you're thinking about going here, either (A)  You're looking for entertainment value, or (B) You have a death wish.  

If it's (A), you won't be disappointed, it's fun.  Staff dressed up as Doctors and Nurses (naughty nurses that adminster shots), entertaining menu's, mandatory hospital gowns, parody posters on the walls, they even produced their own video news clips.  Marketing guys get 5 stars.

If it's (B), IMO it would take quite a few Quadruple Bypass burgers to off yourself.  Just my opinion, your experience may vary.  I had the Quadruple Bypass, and other than a mild food coma, experienced no ill effects.  The food is OK.  Burger was good, and the bacon was excellent.  The fries?  Well, let's just say there's a reason fries aren't typically fried in lard.  My wife ordered the fries and didn't even finish them.

My pet peeves:  they won't serve you tap water, you have to purchase bottled water.  If you ask for water, they'll just bring you a bottle of water.  Boo.

Pet peeve #2:  they won't let you split a burger.  Naturally, everyone wants the Quadruple Bypass Burger, 'cuz it's the bomb.   Just let people split it and charge a split fee.  I didn't really want to eat that, but I did.  Just to get the full experience.

 Judged strictly on quality of food, this place is two stars.  Judged on entertainment value, it's four stars.  Am I glad I went?  You betcha.  Would I go again?  Probably not.  If a bunch of friends were going, would I come along?  Sure."}

The food is good and there is absolutely no green stuff here. The environment is fun and everyone is in great spirit. 

Upon entering you are given a hospital gown. That instantly puts you in a the mood to chow down. The staff is dressed like nurses. And there's a few people in scrubs. The decorations are hilarious and just add to the scene.

Definitely going to come back here every time I go to Vegas. I order the single bypass burger and fries just to be safe (no spankings over here). But I think I can definitely finish a double bypass the next. 

This is a place that you go to with good friends. Laugh, drink and make sure to eat all your food or else."}

The shake however was pretty good if you can get past the big tab of butter floating in your shake! My wife had the double by pass burger and fries and she said that she prefer 5 guys over it and the fries again was kinda marginal not not delivering on taste even with the gargantuan amount of calories it enstowed. The reason I give two stars is because it was kinda fun watching patrons of the resturant  getting paddled by the waitress and watching the reactions of the customers. Wearing the hospital gown is not optional btw so be prepared to donn one! Enjoy."}

Unfortunately, it's really not. The burger and fries I got were decent, but not anything special. And service was not that good.

I just ordered a single bypass burger and it was moist, but not juicy. And the fries were brown and really needed salt to taste good. They were rather flimsy and really nothing special, even if they are in fact cooked in lard.

As for service, it wasn't the worst, but it could've been better. The hostess at the front really looked miserable and like she didn't want to be there. The "nurse" who served me at my table was okay, but after she took my order I waited around 20 minutes for a burger and fries! Other people who had been in there before me were waiting as well, and then finally everybody's food all came out at the same time. The nurse did check on me once, but otherwise she was just mingling with the others as well as the "doctor" throughout the night. The place was rather empty, too!

What makes this place interesting aside from the obvious hospital theme is the fact that they show music videos of some classic old hits on the big screen. I also thought it was cute how on the receipt, the restaurant was referred to as a "diet center" and the tax was called "Obama's cut."

I was hoping to be blown away when I decided to try this place that warns people that it's bad for your health. Unfortunately, I found that I can get a better burger elsewhere and similar fries without the artery clogging, or upset stomach that I felt a bit later on that evening. In short, not worth the hype or price."}

Well it turned out to be the opposite. Yes it was funny to sit in a hospital gown, but unless you were there for jello shots and hard core drinking, the waitresses wouldn't pay any attention to you. It took us 15 minutes to get our drink order and then longer to get our actual order. I just got a single burger and fries and let me tell you after eating that "food" i wanted to vomit. 

The fries were rock hard and not good at all for something fried in lard. The burger might have been okay if the chili wasn't on it because it tasted like powdered chili (aka vomit). Definitely not quality food and they make their money off the atmosphere. I couldn't  even finish my food, so my boyfriend had so shove it down so I didn't get spanked. But we COULD NOT finish those gross fries. Didn't get a spanking because it was clear how upset we were. As the slow service theme continued to get our check, we walked out of there with that burger sitting in our stomach's for hours."}

2 adults 

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 4 stars

Background - Heard about this place, and we walking around Fremont so we had to try it.

Atmosphere - Dinner feel but sterile almost.  Lots of parody posters of their brand.  The whole gown thing is funny.

Food
  Appetizer - nope

  Main Course - The single burger was good, the fries were warm at best.

  Dessert - none for me.

Service - The whole gown thing is a mess, some people get help putting on and taking them off from the host, others have to do it themselves.  Our waitress was very scatter.  Them using iPads or something similar add the staff walking a "texting", looks very un-organized.  Probably is very effective but it did not come across that way to me.

Future - Once was probably enough."}

Everyone at my table enjoyed their burger a lot. The milkshake tasted more like chocolate pudding than a normal shake, but it was still very good. The fries were tasted fine, nothing really special. 

The atmosphere is great though. Tons of funny movie poster parodies with food puns. You go here once and never again. But that one time is really great."}

We looked at the heart attack grill and thought WOW what a cool place to eat. BOY WAS I WRONG!. We had to wait over 20 Min's just to be seated which was OK because the place was busy and a tourist attraction. But after we were seated our waiter messed up a large groups order so it took him 20 Min's to even notice us. After we flagged him down he made us wait another five Min's then finally took our order. He brought our "water" $1.84 a piece because they don't offer free water and then placed our order. The waiter checked in on us 10 Min's later assuring us that we would get our order in five minutes but by this time he took another group of 15 foot ball players. so we had to wait for him to take all their orders and while it was taking a long time another waitress had to bring over the order for us. 
I ordered a double bypass and my wife ordered a single by pass. Both our burgers were dry and burnt my wife took three bites of her burger and she then said that this was enough. I only took one bite of mine. WE DECIDED TO GETUP AND LEAVE. I told the waiter that his service was horrible and that we were not going to pay. He then ran to the bar counter where the manager was and began to tell him the situation. This guy dressed as the head doctor pretty much said well this is the way that they are made and there is no way that we would get our money back because we ate the food. I told him that this was BS. he then threatened me to call the Security and I had to pay for it or go to jail for a Misdemeanor. I told him to take off half the food and paid for something I didn't enjoy.

Moral of the story kids is if you want to be treated badly and have a long wait and over pay then go to this place but if your looking for at least one star service then don't come here at all save your money. We went across the street to the Irish pub and they gave us another burger and even gave us free soda because we were treated badly. I give this place the big TWO THUMBS DOWN~!"}

You and your fellow guests will be dressed in hospital garments, fed EXTREMELY unhealthy food - very sickening the sizes of burgers that are available here. You can drink wine from an intravenous drip, syringe filled with vodka, and get spanked from waitresses dressed up in nurses uniforms for not finishing your dinner.

1. The service is horrible!! Horrible! Horrible!! The waitresses are mean, unhelpful, obviously hate their jobs other than the part where they get to spank people. (The only actual smile the waitresses had) 
2. The prices are high! with extremely low quality food. 
3. I got the single bypass with bacon and chili and the burger was as extremely overdone and the chili had the consistency of diarrhea with the taste of blended Walmart brand chili while the fries were soggier than I thought possible.They also only serve bottled drinks here. So no you can't have a glass of water. 

Within 20 of eating here my entire group of 8 people had to run to the Golden Nugget to take emergency dumps! 

Why would you go here!!
Don't GO HERE!
STOP!! If you are in Fremont right now and looking at this review! Save your money and just take a cab to In N Out!

oh yeah Cash only here! wtf why would a newer sit down restaurant be Cash Only! Get a Square or Paypal reader! Yes complaining about cash only is fair because it shows what a greasy cheap under the table establishment this is.(oh bookkeeping and 3% is too expensive for this obvious cheaply ran place)  That is an inconvenience as someone that messaged me complained about this review. Cash only businesses don't get called out as a negative if the meal is less than $10 or an exceptional mom and pop shop; this place is clearly neither. Very easily one of the top 5 worst businesses I have ever reviewed."}

Downside is they only offer chili, onion, tomato, cheese and bacon to go in your burger. No pickles or relish etc. They also dont ask you how you want it cooked..

Upside is the shakes with brownie chunks in it is heavenly!! Its also freaking huge. Along with the single bypass burger.

Biggest upside is you get 3 spanks with a paddle if you dont finish your food.

Great to experience at least once, but unless you want a spanking from a hot nurse you better go hungry.

The owner/Doctor greeted us but didn't have much of a personality not like what I have expected from all the articles.  Our nurse didn't have much of a personality comparred to the others we saw that were more engaged with their patients.  Ours may have been new and just a little shy.  We sat not far from the scale and saw a couple of skinny people get on it for a laugh.  They have DJ.  I don't know why everyone is saying they don't serve bottle water - I got it. My only complaint was that they didn't have fountain drinks with ice.  I really wanted a Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb but the machine was broken.  I did get a coke in a glass bottle and got a straw.  I got the single bypass and my husband got the double.  The burgers were served within 5 minutes of waiting.  They were EXCELLENT.  The cheese had a very good flavor and the fries were very crispy.  We did witness two people get the 8000 calorie burger; 1 was a very large man and the other 1 was a little guy who ordered it for a good laugh.  They also had a really nice bar area too.  It seemed a little dead in there but we did eat around 5PM.  I think they need to add credit card machines and fountain drinks and that is why I am giving three stars.  I have to say it was an excellent burger and I loved the cuteness of the creativity of the Doctor.  I wish the Doctor nothing but success.  We don't want another practice in Vegas to close down."}

It is good for laughs but don't be in a hurry they are SLOW........... and they make you pay with cash but take orders on iPhones. WTF get a square and make it easy on your customers.

If over 350 you eat for free. Otherwise yuppy ate paying for the decor and theme.

If you want a unique theme and plenty of pics then this is your place"}

I ordered their smallest burger with cheese and tomato, french fries and a vanilla milkshake. The burger was overcooked, and when I asked for medium well, I was told that they only do well done. The fries were super greasy and soggy and the Vanilla Milkshake was actually garnished with butter. I asked why that was and was told that it was a "Butterfat" shake. It had an odd buttery taste to it so 85% of that got wasted.

Despite a cool atmosphere, and limited menu, I will not be returning. Although I have to say that everything BUT the food was super cool."}

I was really pissed when Jillian's closed. It was one of the few venues that featured local bands and appealed to the under 21 crowd. That's a rarity in the valley, the biggest advancement of all ages shows on the strip was in the earliest incarnation of Gameworks, when it had the climbing structure in the coke bottle. 

Would Jillian's replacement be worthy? I went in with a big open mind, which is necessary here.

First thing you notice outside is, how do I put it nicely? Well, they didn't. It's not a truck scale. It's to weigh those that challenge it's 350 lb. mark. If you're heavier than that, you get to eat for free, the details of which I'm not sure of. I'm guessing it's not for a side salad.

Since I didn't have much time, I decided to go in for a PBR and because I was reluctant to binge in a place that encouraged it on this level. 

A new place has a "lot to take in" factor when you enter, must be a board of tourism rule more than a one of fine dining. Before you can visually climatize a couple of hostesses (let's face it, there's no hosts in a breastaurant) put a cloth gown on you. You realize everyone is dressed this way. Is that their form of a bib? 

They put a strap on your wrist, get it it's like a hospital patients'?! There are Vegas restaurants that want you to advertise to other tourists where you've been. Where did they get that big white paper hat? We have to eat there!(?) Where'd they get that guitar you can drink from? Let's go there!

They hand you a menu, that lets you know you can buy it on the cover. I sat at the bar because I love bar service for several reasons. At this bar, there's a "doctor" bartender. I could focus on the carnival that unfolds in this place. 

There's a lucky strike cigarette machine (unfiltered). There are servers dressed in tight cleavage nurse outfits. If you're eating here, chances are you've heard about the people who have actually died that have had some connection to the place. While other businesses would shun this, this place advertises it. A local has their ashes on the bar and I heard the bartender tell his story 4 times the time I was there. For 1 beer.

With a wooden paddle, nurses actually spank guys that don't finish their burgers, so you better not have to pee or crap if you can't finish. See how funny it is that a cute nurse gets to spank a guy while you eat dinner? 

They offer 4 burgers for their menu, the difference being the number of patties. They took a cue from the success of In-n-out burger's minimal menu. But at least HAG offers pickles, bacon and mustard. 

On the walls there are  a lot of collages of images, 3 kinds: 1) towards the bathroom, there are all kinds of classic pieces of art with a HAG modification of it, maybe to appeal to "higher class," patrons? 2) on the far back wall are pop movie posters, each has a HAG modification, to appeal to 20-30 somethings, get it? 3) a mural on the far wall of the last supper, and the participants are fast food mascots eating with a doctor from HAG, to appeal to kids, get it? 

It's a big lesson in ad marketing, mix your brand with successful, well known symbols as if to be endorsed by them, using them under the copyright loophole of spoofing. Star Max Wars, get it? With Luke Maxwalker. 

This place seems to cater to the bachelor/ette crowds, as well as the people that give the guy they know that coughs with their smoking problem a pack of cigarettes. It's based on peer dares, weather or not you can "handle it."

Yeah, I got the jokes. And in Vegas, I certainly have handled many challenges of unsafe drinking, drugs and sexual uh... This place is crawling with gimmickry and I just felt like I was in front of planet hollywood, with all the ads yelling at me with flashy lights and people sticking fliers in my face.

This place is like tabloid tv, it may be fun to check out and "laugh at," but I wouldn't want to be a regular part of it until I became it."}

Here's the problem-the place lives and (quite literally) dies on this joke. (And taking a lame political cheap shot by calling the Nevada state sales tax "Obama's cut"?) Once you get past the decor you're left with a sub-par, overpriced diner with a very limited selection. Hint: adding a separate entry onto the menu for each patty is kind of like increasing your font size to meet the minimum page requirements for a report. Quite literally, all they serve for food is burgers, fries and hotdogs. (They do have shakes, beer, liquor and soft drinks). 

The good: 
They make a pretty good pumpkin pie and vodka milkshake.
The music playing seemed pretty good the whole way through.

The bad:
Only taking cash? What year is it again? 
Complete lack of variety. You'd think you could throw in dessert options if you're celebrating wanton obesity. You can throw other things into a deep fryer besides fries, you know."}

Upon checking into the Heart Attack Grill, nurses slap a wristband and cotton gown on you before escorting you to the cafeteria, where all the other patients are dining. 

The bf and I shared the single bypass burger + 5 strips of bacon (+ $1) (we can't share the double, triple, or quadruple), but ordered our own drinks. His choco milkshake had a piece of butter swimming in it, I had a Mexican coke in a glass bottle. The burger was bland and dry... luckily the bacon saved the flavor for me to finish my half of the burger. The fries were just as dull in flavor. For food cooked in lard, one would think there would be more taste... after all, we're splurging on the calories already... may as well make it savory!

A cheap meal that can only be forked out in ca$h, but if you forget, don't fret, because the ATM in the restaurant charges a mere $0.75 service fee (unheard of and practically free in Vegas!) 

The meal was entertaining and all the patients were in high spirits, completely unlike a true hospital cafeteria. I would not return for their outrageously unhealthy and tasteless food, but this is a fun tourist trap for daredevils to try :) (those who finish the quadruple bypass get rolled out in a wheelchair)"}

The sight is comical but the burgers are serious business. The burgers are huge and nothing short of delicious. However, I wish their menu had more items... Don't expect anything healthy from here.

Kind of like a one last send off before cutting back on calories this year.  I thought this would be the perfect place to go out with a bang.  I knew it would be a gimmick kind of place before arriving.  I had seen it on TV.  I had read some reviews.  I was unaware of the hospital gown as required attire.  I kind of got a kick out of that.  I was joking with the "nurse" about it feeling  draft up my back side.  After being seated the nurse explained the "procedures."  My order was placed quickly via cell phone in the nurses hand.  I ordered a single bypass burger with bacon, a coke and a side of fries.  Fries were not served with as one reviewer has stated.  They were an extra $2.  When my food arrived (after being apologized to for the delay numerous times), I noticed my burger with lettuce, tomatoe, pickes, cheese and bacon.  Again, different than a previous review.  I squirted on some mustard, ketchup and mayo then noticed only three slices of bacon rather than the advertised five.  I mentioned it to the nurse and she brought a bascket of extra bacon.  I don't think I was charged for it.  Bonus.  The burger was good.  Not fantastic.  It was big and filling.  I think I would struggle with a double or larger.   The taste was good.  The meat was charred on the outside with a bit of crunch yet still juicy on the inside.  The fries were not my style.  I never use ketchup on fries but needed to this time.  They had a burnt taste and little salt.  It reminded me of In-N-Out Fries.

Over all, this is a fun place to visit once.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was interesting.  The food was OK.  I don't plan on going back unless some out-of-towners would like to try it for the novelty it brings to the Vegas experience."}

When I entered I thought that it was a stupid gimik but I went a long with it because I was hungry and in a hurry. 

We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.  

While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.  

He arrogantly asked "what's the problem," in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, "leave then!"  

The girl responded, "you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?"

The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  "You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth."  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.  

I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.  

I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The "owner" made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward."}

In a city full of sin, how can you settle for anything less. Total dudes' place much akin to Hooters. I admire the great risk that the owner took to bring it here, but of course well...I'm a self proclaimed fatass. I didn't have problems with the extra extra friendly (spanking) service. This place is damn unique.

-=-Quadruple Bypass Champ-=- Yep you heard it. I downed the 8000 calories in one sitting. Sure, the 270 mile ride home wasn't fun, but you gotta pay to play. Most might say so much quantity that it can't possibly taste good, but let me tell you....the tastiness of the patty is really what got me through this. It's no frills cooked to tenderness perfection, with a slathering of cheese melted on. No charcoal mess, no gimmicks, just good ol' food. My technique was to divide and conquer where I essentially made 2 doubles. When I knocked down that tower of meat, the sense of accomplishment was monumental. I looked over at my partners' burgers and juices were just spilling down, but my plate, no messy droppings. All technique! At the end of the meal, I was wheeled out to my car in a hospital robe by my buxom nurse server. I was King of the World this day. King of the Toilet that night."}

I've passed over this place many a time laughing at the gimmickry involved in keeping this place open. It's so absurd as a concept that it's entertaining. In earnest, when my father told me this was where we were eating that day for lunch, I began to talk him out of it. But it was his day and I suspect he was going for the nursing outfits.

To start with, you're required to keep on the hospital gowns. It's a cute gimmick but annoying when you're wearing a sweater. The menu is unsurprisingly limited. Giant hot dogs or build your size burger with fried sides. The prices are inexplicably high unless you want to add unnecessary amounts of bacon. For some reason, adding bacon costs about a buck.

The beer selection is a choice of three overpriced cans. Or you can go for soda or the gimmick IV alcohol or Jell-O shot syringe to name a few. 

A highlight is the overall gimmick in itself. The movie poster adaptations are interesting scenery. The homemade music video interpretations are both fascinating and disturbing. The nurses are cute in their skimpy costumes, but there are plenty of restaurants in Vegas with barely clad girls and tasty food.

And that brings us to the heart of the review: the food. The single bypass burger was not just incredibly unhealthy (as advertised) but genuinely terrible. It wasn't just sautéed in lard; it was brutalized by it. It was so overdone I complained to the waitress. Her response was, "if you don't finish, you get spanked." I attempted to explain that parts of the patty were burnt and she eventually replaced it with something eerily similar. This was definitely not "a burger worth dying for." It's not even a burger worth paying for. The onion rings and fries were plentiful, but again, generally terrible. I get the gimmick of wanting to pack calories into each meal. But doing so to sacrifice flavor goes against the entire purpose of a restaurant. You can do high calorie artery clogging decedent food that tastes good. 

 Heart attack grill's problem is that it is more money making gimmick than restaurant. It's the culinary equivalent of cow tipping."}

Wait, let me reiterate, he INSISTED we eat there. I hadn't heard of it before and didn't know what to expect. We arrived about 9pm ish. 

Outside of the restaurant there is a huge scale that entices drunk people to weigh themselves for all of Freemount St. to see. There's also a neon sign saying if you weigh 350lbs or more you eat for free. Foregoing getting on the scale, we walked in and was immediately accosted by "nurses" in tight & revealing uniforms, who put us in hospital gowns and gave us "hospital wrist bands". Now I know why my friend wanted to come here, the nurses....not to worry girls, the "doctors" are equally hot.

Stephanie was our server and she was really friendly. There were 6 of us. Everyone ordered the Single By-Pass Burger with a side of fries except for one who decided on the ginormous Chili Dog. While looking at the menu, it said if you didn't finish your menu, the nurses would spank you. Deciding I didn't want to get spanked, my friend and I decided to share the single. We ordered a couple of shakes to share. Wasn't too keen on the calorie count it claimed but, it was pretty good. 

We also ordered the peniscillin Jell-O shots. It actually comes out in the shape of a....., well, I'll pass on the graphics and let your imagination go to the dark place. The peniscillin shot is filled with white jello and is like a needle shot you'd get at the doctors's office. Let's just say they aren't served in glasses, you shoot it in your mouth. I would've posted pics but I'll keep this G-rated. 

The food was nothing special, it's just a burger loaded with bacon and a ton of calories. It was cooked to my liking and I'm so glad I shared with my friend because I could barely finish it. 

My friend who ordered the chili dog wasn't able to finish his. I pointed out that he was about to get his booty spanked...woot woot and he literally started getting nervous. I actually didn't think they'd spank people but it was fun teasing the drunk guy. He tried to get us to help him but we refused. He tried swapping his basket with another friend who had finished his meal. I reminded him Stephanie would probably remember he ordered the chili dog since he's the only one who ordered it on our table. He said there was no way they would spank customers and was probably a gimmick. Well, what do you know, at that very moment, we hear "pack, pack, pack" and people cheering. A guy was getting spanked! And the nurse wasn't spanking him gently either!  Our friend seriously panicked and started grabbing everyone's basket and trying to hide his unfinished meal. It was hilarious. He was begging us not to tell our waitress. I really wanted to see him get spanked. Guess you had to be there cuz it was very funny seeing him sweating. When the check came, he threw some money on the table and bolted out the door....wuss.

The ambience is retro themed, like a novelty fast food burger joint, with hospital decorations. There are a lot of seatings with music playing in the back ground. There's also a scale inside and a few big guys got on it and what do you know, they weigh more than 350 lbs. one guy who I think was their friend was 3 lbs shy. The patrons cheered and were engaging. Maybe because we went late at night, when everyone is "feeling good" the place seemed alive. 

For me Heart Attack Grill is a one time deal, just to say, I've been there, done that. Don't expect the most amazing burgers. Go there for the novelty. 

Service was spot on and super friendly, the reason for the 4 star rating. 

I think the hospital gowns they give you are freshly laundered because when we left we put it in a laundry basket. 

As many Yelpers have stated, they take cash only. So keep this on mind. It's also kid friendly."}

I did not eat nor attempted to eat anything off the Heart Attack Grill menu.  I did this solely should my friend cannot Yelp this place if he did not survive his meal.*

With that said, I've heard crazy things about the Heart Attack Grill...and nothing on the positive side.  Though it's really up to the individual to come dine here, this place was pretty gimmicky and markets itself on unhealthy eating and radical indulgence.  I considered myself a very healthy eater so when my friend wanted to try out this place, I went along as moral support (and potentially an ambulance caller).

So here we go: my friend weighed himself on the outside scale and coaxed me in.  We were "greeted" by this poor and very unhappy hostess that gave us a quick lowdown on how this place operates.  I went along with the campy hospital gown get-up and laughable wrist band.

The place was very empty that night with only two or three other tables that were occupied.  We were seated to the far right of the restaurant and were given menus.  Prior to coming here I decided that I won't be eating anything here but to keep my friend company on his artery-clogging journey.  After a short while this super skinny rather ditzy blonde waitress with the classic Minnie Mouse squeak came over to take the order of a single bypass burger with flatliner fries.  

If I were to point out anything positive here, it would be the rather entertaining music videos that were playing on the big screen.  The videos were from the 80's and kindly reminded me of my youth and stupidity.  On other screens, it showed news stories regarding the Heart Attack Grill and even how two people apparently ate themselves sick.  The place seemed proud of this "achievement".

While waiting for the food to arrive, I noticed that other patrons were still waiting for theirs.  It was apparent that since it was a slow night, the cook might have decided to gather enough orders to make all the burgers all at once.  People at the other tables did seem restless.

Finally the food arrive and what I saw was a hamburger with oversized buns and a side of very dark dirty looking fries.  I cringed when my friend took his first bite and asked for his opinion.  He replied he had better...which spoke volumes.  The fries themselves looked like they were fried in old reheated lard; very dark and flimsy.  While he ate, I just sat there in my hospital gown hoping nobody I know sees me.

From the 3rd person point of view, the service here was pretty sucky.  Servers were seen gathering at one spot just conversing and joking around with each other.  Our waitress didn't really come over to check on us but just to leave off the bill.  Obviously the customers were not much of their concern.

Just think: I gave up seeing a nudie show for this.  At least my friend survived...and never got spanked."}

My boyfriend and I decided to go on our last full day and it was so much fun! I am a huge fan of themed restaurants​ so I definitely​ enjoyed wearing a hospital gown and having the waitresses dressed up as nurses. My boyfriend ordered the octuple (largest) burger on the menu! IT WAS INSANE. I was surprised not many people order it cause when it came out everyone in the restaurant​ went crazy. They say you get spanked if you don't finish your burger but that did not happen when we did not finish ours? One downfall was we were asking the waitress what drinks are good and she was not very helpful. It would have been nice to know wine was served in a IV bag, but she did not tell me so I ordered a frozen drink that came with the shot on the side in a pill bottle. I wish I ordered the wine but I did not know until a customer next to us had ordered that. Overall the food and staff are decent but the atmosphere is pretty cool! I recommend trying it out."}

First  you walk in and you get put in a hospital gown which i thought was way to funny ,the waitress are dressed up as nurses and the bartenders are the doctors pretty cool . there are mixed reviews about this place but everyone has there opinion the burgers were very juicy and had a good taste not dry at all the fries were also good especially since they are fried in lard i had my concerns of them being super soggy and like greasy but i was very wrong .

I  ordered the double bypass burger with cheese and my husband ordered the double bypass with bacon and these burgers were no joke they were huge . we ordered a Butterfat milkshake it was SO yummy and so creamy and even had a cube a butter  and a mini Hershey bar as well it was a experience for me with this milk shake .

They are a cash only restaurant  but they sell beer and wine and frozen drinks . i thought it was cool the nurses aka our waitress took our order on there IPHONE .

I can see having a dress code at a country club but requiring someone to wear a hospital gown that hasn't been washed?  This place is ridiculous, I hope it goes out of business soon.

Who would eat this crap anyway...let alone take their kids.  There are better burgers to be had had many fast food joints or even across the street at the Irish pub.  Besides, who wants to wade through waves of panhandlers just to get to the front door of this crappy joint?"}

My boyfriend and I thought it was awesome. We went last month for the first time and he ordered a single burger with fries and a beer. I ordered fries and a butterfat shake. We both loved our food. And honestly, because I am a huge milkshake fan, I love to try new ones and this was by far the best shake I've had in a very long time. (chocolate) So thick and creamy and delicious! (must be all the fat haha)
Fries were great but I did have to add a little more salt which was not a problem, my boyfriend said his burger was awesome and cooked just right.
When going to this restaurant, you know you are in for a fatty, greasy, salty time and that's what you should expect. 
The nurse outfits were cute, the aprons they put on you were so fun, the whole experience of this place was like no other. We DEFINITELY recommend trying heart attack grill! It was really fun, tasty, and our waitress was awesome too. :)"}

The food is all served with disposable cutlery and plates.

It was either this place or the healthy Mediterranean place across the way. Pssh...I'm in Vegas betch.

We were "admitted" to this place and given a hospital gown and bracelet. The nurse was hot, so was the doctor. This sounds like the beginning of some smut film. Our nurse sat us down and I felt like I was in the looney bin. 
Some folks were getting shots in syringes, wine in bags, and paddles to their caboose. All very strange and quite entertaining. 

We ordered a single bypass burger, which we split because they don't split the bigger burgers. If you don't finish your burger, that's a paddling. Burger toppings are limited, possibly to deter people from getting all fancy. When the burger and fries arrived they just looked sloppy. And I'm all for a sloppy burger, but it looked disgusting. Definitely not the best burger I've had. It was actually pretty bland considering it had chili on it. I realized that I was basically paying for the ambience. I washed it down with a Mexican Coke and took some candy cigarettes to go.  Now that I've done it I won't be back here."}

I'd say go for the experience and less of the food. The location  of this place is a great place right in the old Las Vegas downtown. Walking in it seems like a normal burger place, but everywhere instead of servers you have nurses. The decor was really nice I enjoyed looking at the remake of posters toward their advertisement. Also the set up In the middle of the resturant where the person will be spanked so everyone can see.

The nurse server we had was really nice. Even in her busy moments she took the time to talk and chat with us about eveything they had and go in a bit to her personal life. 

The food on the other had was eh. I'm not much of a person the have their food cooked in lard I guess. I had the triple bypass which was their first burger to hit world record presumably. I finished it there alright I wasn't gonna get spanked. While mainly everyone went single and still struggled. But main taste was grease which I wished atleast have some flavor of something else. 

But overall worth a try just don't get to hyped about it."}

If you are going to have a good time you should really try to get into the spirit of the place. It is cash only, but they do have an ATM on site. We didn't need it, but from what they told us it was only 75 cents. So there is that. 

When you walk in they lay out the rules... In that you have to pay cash, wear a hospital gown, and finish your food. 

The menu is all "bad" for you, but it was all very delicious. The burger patties are 1/2 pound use that as your gauge of how much you can eat. If you don't finish your burger the sweet nurses will paddle you for it. So be good and eat up!!! Jello shot syringes are a must, also why not get a pill bottle of alcohol. It is a fun souvenir to have. The burgers all come with chili, without the beans, and they are delicious. 

It was definitely a good experience all around. I recommend at least one trip to this place!!!

I tried the hot dog, problem is the chili was so so, and no heat to it. The dog itself was decent but the bun coulda woulda shoulda be smaller or toasted or something. The girls were kinda lackluster but maybe it was because we went on a Sunday. There just wasn't a lot of personality in the room and isn't that what makes a tourist restaurant a place locals want to go too? The best part was checking out the posters with my 20 year old daughter and laughing at how the adapted them.

The Hamburger patties are pretty thin, and most of the flavor comes from the toppings. I had a Coronary Dog, which was quite good, actually - albeit, probably 5,000 calories! Flatline Fries are covered in (sliced) Cheese and Chili and are good, but the Lard flavor in the chili leaves a strange feeling in the mouth. Bring cash!

One was of a cartoon mural with about 10 of the old school fast food icons: Ronald McDonald, Wendy, Dominos Pizza Guy, Jack In The Box, etc.... There was a lot of thought put into the decor. Theres a huge scale inside & out so you can weigh yourself. Anyone 350 pounds or more eat free. All the females are dressed as nurses & males as doctors. 2 big screen tv's which were playing re-runs of news reels from stories of the grill, a guy being gurnied out by medics due to an actual heart attack, etc.

The menu is extemely simple: A single, double, triple, quadruple bypass burger-all with bacon. The single has 5 pieces of bacon, double has 10 pieces, triple 15, and quad 20!! Beef is 1/2 pound to 2 lbs with all the fixings: cheese, onion & tomatoe. French fries that are fresh cut & deep fried in pure Lard, mmmmmmm!! Either a chocolate or Vanilla milkshake made with ButterFat. A bottled water or CocaCola in a bottle. No other sodas and they dont have ice.

CASH ONLY! They also sell Lucky Strike Cigarettes in a vending machine by the carton.

The food was nothing spectacular, Ive definitely had better. But the experience was fun & different. A nurse went to a table and spanked a customer with a paddle for being a bad boy & not finishing his food. (A couple at the next table who hadnt ordered yet got up and left after seeing that happen), I thought it was funny but maybe its not for everyone. I would go back again for the experience."}

Anyway the menu is a burger, hotdog, fries or chili fries, limited drink options plus milkshakes with a tab of butter on top why? Why the hell not after you ate the 7 patty burger with the pound of bacon, chili, lettuce, tomato and cheese on it.
I got the single, the girls split a single and the other guy in the group got a double. We finished everything so we didn't get paddled, but some people weren't so lucky. 

The food? It wasn't bad. It was a pretty big patty, the fries were good, coke in a glass bottle. Our service was a little slow but it was pretty busy on a friday night.

They have burgers, fries, shakes, and liquor. That is all. If you are expecting more, you will be disappointed. Everything is calorie-filled and tasty, and you won't leave hungry. The shakes have a pad of butter on top and are around 2000 calories.

They only take cash but have an ATM in the restaurant with a small 75 cent service fee.

If you don't get a heart attack from eating their food, you will definitely get one from looking at the waitresses.

Our host told the host at the restaurant she can seat how many she can at once that we don't have to all sit together. The girl then said she will not be able to serve us.  So my boss the owner of the company walked in ^ tried to get seats & he was starting to get upset because the host was ignoring him.  So he asked if she spoke english since she was ignoring him.  That was wrong of him but he was frustrated at this point.  The host of Heart Attack Grill proceeded to say that she does & that we are disrespectful & refuses to seat us & has every right to,  So we told her fine that she just lost alot a money & we walked out.  I thought about it & went back in to ask for the manager contact info & the girls name that refused us service.  The security stepped in between & told her not to respond.  She told me she has the right to refuse service to who she wants & I told her "Yes, you do have the right to refuse service to us or anyone else, but I also have the right to file complaint with your  management" Needless to say she refused to give up any info about the manager or owner info or her name. As a person that runs a company customer service is #1 & the host provided bad customer service from the start.  And turning away 40 people for no reason other than they cant seat them together is a joke. Especially when we told her she can seat everyone separate, & that we don't have to be seated all at once. It was going to be my first time at Heart Attack Grill, but I will never step foot in that business just from this one experience.  I could just imagine how the service would have been if we would have got inside.  Needless to say we got in Micky Finn's Restaurant & Bar right away and they put us all together & their service was great!

My husband ordered a burger and fries. The fries were brown. THEY WERE BROWN! How the hell do you get brown fries?? The burger was gross. He only ate half of it. When ordering, the waitress/nurse warned if you didn't eat it all then you get a spanking. What hospital spanks?? A porn hospital maybe. Whatever. I think I gave out the "don't even freaking touch us" vibe, because she didn't. 

I ordered a chocolate butterfat shake, not knowing what they meant by "butterfat". It came with a pat of butter in it, like some kind of garnish. Butter is not a garnish for ice cream. Blech!

Oh and.... It's cash only. Seriously? Ok I get the joke of "no checks, you might die before it clears" as fitting in with the whole hospital theme. No restaurant takes checks. But geez, take debit cards.

By all means, it's something to try out just for shits and giggs.  But it's not necessarily somewhere I'd lunch at on a weekly basis.  

Upon walking in, my friend and I were directed to put on hospital gowns.  The restaurant requires that everyone puts one on.  Okay, that's cute, it has a theme...

Once seated, and continuing with the shtick, we were informed that they don't offer water, any diet beverages, or splenda/equal, etc. for iced tea.  I sort of get the diet soda but no water?  I foresee that being uncomfortable in the summer when it's really hot here.  

My friend and I split the smallest hamburger and fries.  (We're two smaller chicks.)  The hamburger was decent, nothing special.  For the price, you can definitely find a better burger in this town.  The fries, however, were kinda gross.  In my opinion, fries fried in duck fat is simply unnatural and tasted funny.  I mean, I grew up eating certain foods fried in lard, particularly at my grandmother's house, so it's not exactly an unfamiliar taste.   Who knows, maybe I've grown conditioned to fries fried in certain types of oil.  The fries were also soggy.  I can't quite put my finger on the taste, but suffice it to say, I won't be ordering fries there again.

Would I go again? Meeh...probably not...maybe, just maybe, with OOT family or friends.  But there'd have to be A LOT of arm twisting. 
  
Oh yeah, they only take cash (no credit/debit cards) and they don't validate Fremont Street parking."}

Seriously. Lots of people design creative craft cocktails, but then other people make them and they're way off balance. Or something else is wrong. We had six, and all were in the range of stellar to magnificent.

5++++ stars for those amazing cocktails. Great variety too. Some more boozy, some less, great variety of spirits and house-made elixirs.

Great service.

Food? Left a lot to be desired for me but my partner was more easily pleased.

We shared mac n cheese (my personal favorite and one of the better macs around), broccoli crunch, and roasted cauliflower. The cauliflower was a garlic cop-out. Like young people who don't understand flavor and cook only with garlic and salt. Only in this case it's garlic and lemon. Not interesting, not creative. The broccoli crunch had raisins (not on menu list) and lacked pepitas (on menu list). If it's going to flip from what's advertised they should tell you.

Surprise raisins are just not cool. Partner liked both of those dishes, but I'm the chef in the family, and I found them lacking. I think he liked the mac less because of the pasta but I thought the pasta was excellent--smaller elbows that didn't taste like boiled bread like some of the larger pastas can. Had a nice tang.

Overall this place warrants a visit, especially from those who eat meat. The heavy-on-meat menu had a lot of creative options. They really should add a vegetarian sandwich/slider option to the all-meat sandwich list. 

My other complaint was being seated by a rear door that apparently leads to a patio (unused because freeeeeezing) and the offices, but employees constantly went out to the "office" for apparently no good reason and froze us out every single time they opened the door (about 30 times in 3 hours)."}

The food is awesome, the services is amazing, and what a fun environment!  We sat on stools facing the cooks, so we were able to watch all the prep.  The thing I was struck by the most was how well the staff gets along.  They seemed happy to be doing their jobs and the affection they had for one another was clearly evident.  The food is phenomenal.  We ordered the Chicken skins, asparagus salad, butter burger and pizza (ham and pineapple).  Everything was delicious.  The chicken skins are very popular, and although I like crispy skin, they were a bit much for me.  The idea of eating all that skin kind of got in my head a little,  but my husband loved them.  We had the bourbon brownie and bacon ice cream for dessert.  It was so rich and delicious.  I highly recommend Carson Kitchen.  We will make this a must stop during all our trips to Vegas!  (p.s. this restaurant is in the old part near Fremont Street.  It is wedged in the middle of an old building - facing the street.  There is on street parking, but be ready to put some money in the kiosk.  Nothing is free in Vegas anymore!)"}

Tonight I was super excited to try out Carson Kitchen. I left unimpressed and actually a bit offended by the waiter's service. 

Initially, the night started off alright. He introduced himself (I forgot his name) and was attentive enough. He gave us waters and recommended that we get about 2 plates/person as this restaurant mainly has small plates that are meant to be shared. We followed his advice and ordered 6 plates total. Halfway through the meal, the service started going downhill. We had 4 plates of food still on our table when he asked us if we were doing okay/if we wanted to order. 6 plates is a lot of food, so we said we were good and didn't order. He came back at least 2 more times while we were having our savory dishes to ask if we wanted to order more. That's a little overkill, especially considering that we already got his recommended amount of plates. When we wanted to order dessert, he was nowhere in sight, and we ended up having to wave at him from across the room. And then he tried pushing for us to try all three desserts. Dude, we're full. He also kept asking us if we wanted more than iced water. I think after the second time of telling him that we were okay with just water, he would get the hint. At the very end of the meal, he also gave us attitude when we asked if we could split the bill three ways. Honestly, he could have easily just told us no and been done with that. There are apps like Venmo; I can work around not being able to split a bill. Instead, he made the rest of the night super awkward as he hovered over us as we tipped him with the portable credit card machine. 

We ordered:
crispy chicken skins - one of the better dishes of the night. You can't go wrong with fried food, and the smoked honey is a nice accompaniment.
bacon jam - They put a lottttttt of balsamic vinegar in this; it was a little too tangy for me. I would put more cheese to balance out the vinegar. It has also an odd texture and reminds me of diced up Asian beef jerky.
black rice and oxtail risotto - They advised to mix the dish up thoroughly before eating. There was a familiar taste to it, but I couldn't place a finger on it. It was alright.... 
baked mac and cheese - They have a pretty sharp cheese in that blend of whatever cheeses they use. It's nice. They also browned the top with some breadcrumbs; the added crunch was a nice change in texture
green, eggs, & ham - It smelled of smoky deliciousness. The eggs were overcooked so we couldn't "spread the egg" to the other pieces of flatbread, like we were advised. However, it also smelled exactly like the wild mushroom flatbread from the table next to us; so I'm going to assume that they taste also similar'
glazed donut bread pudding - this was the star of the night. Get this.


Despite the chicken skins and the dessert, the service I experienced today makes it difficult to want to ever come back.
3 stars for food; -1 star for the awful awful service"}

I was looking for a hip spot with an eclectic menu that included options for two friends with a dietary restriction (they are vegetarians). When I looked at the menu at Carson Kitchen, I thought this was the perfect spot with lots of meat centric options and a large variety of veggie options as well. They were able to accomodate our party of six and seated us inside (I called two weeks in advance). I never got to see their outdoors area but I would imagine the ambiance is more fun than inside. 

The only reason why I am giving Carson Kitchen three stars is because some of the dishes didn't live up to our expectations. The wild mushroom flatbread was oversaturated with some kind of barbecue sauce which is not listed at all on the menu so it was a little shock to the palate. The black rice and oxtail risotto was not good at all. That was sadly a disappointing dish. The crispy chicken skins were just o.k. After hearing so much about them, it was displeasing to find them so bland.

Now that I got that out of the way, I have to mention that the service was amazing. Everyone from the host to the server were great. Our drinks were on par and we had some really delicious dishes; bbq burnt ends, "devil's" eggs, tempura green beans, pig in a duvet, baked mac and cheese, and rainbow cauliflower. The absolute star of the show was the rainbow cauliflower.

Carson Kitchen, you win at service, drinks, and cauliflower."}

Our bad, we didn't think to call in advance. But no harm done, we got drinks at the bar and took them into the garden/patio they have in the back. It was very pretty and we enjoyed ourselves. After an hour, they called us in for our table. Here is what we ordered:

1) Mushroom Flatbread - 5/5 yummy, generously topped
2) Broccoli salad - 3/5 cold salad with a sprinkling of sunflower and pumpkin seeds. It tastes okay.
3) Beet salad - 4/5 if you like beets this is a good one to have. It has mandarin oranges which provide a nice citrus flavor.
4) Macaroni and Cheese - 4/5 what is not to love about mac and cheese. I just took out 1 point for portion size. this is more of a side than a main.
5) Tater Tots - 5/5
6) Chicken Skins - 2/5 Personally did not like the way the chicken skins were seasoned. I guess the honey was supposed to be a nice touch but did nothing to add to flavor.
7) Bacon Jam - 5/5 Delicious!! 
8) Burgers - 4/5 Try it with the Bacon Jam.

Service was terrific, Our server (I forgot his name) was really helpful with recommending dishes and pacing our meal. He was very knowledgeable and we found his insight valuable when navigating the menu. 

Is this worth checking out? I would say so, especially if you are staying in Downtown, this is walking distance and very convenient."}

Bacon jam - jam is too strong, can't really taste the bacon.  I wish that there is more cheese and more bread.
Crispy chicken skin - excellent.  Great with the honey dipping.  
Devil's egg - average.  We order it because a lot of yelper recommended it but it's just like other devil's egg.  Maybe I was expecting too much.
NY Strip - excellent.  Meat is soft.  Very juicy.  Very tasty.
Ancient grain greek (salad) - Good.
Black rice & ox tail Risotto - Good.  But the taste is very subtle.  I wish for a stronger taste.
Mac-Cheese - Good, but it's too expensive for what it is.
Pear & Bleu flatbread - love it.

We were served:

Wok charred edamame
Ancient grain Greek
Blood orange and root
Bacon jam with toasted baguette
Wild mushroom flatbread
Pear and bleu flatbread
Hawaiian sliders
Secret Sunday chicken sandwich
Sprouts and spuds
Steelhead trout
Turducken pot pie
Shepard's 3.14
Banoffee Pie

This was my third visit to Carson Kitchen and I was wowed by the creativity--the risk taking by the chefs with these dishes.  Some standouts for me:  since I hadn't had the bacon jam when it was on the menu before, this was a treat.  As a person who has only eaten Spam for the first time within the last year, I was pleasantly surprised by the Hawaiian slider with a round of Spam on the bottom, a ring of pineapple on top, and the whole thing topped with some seaweed slaw.  The Secret Sunday chicken sandwich is very large so this is definitely a share dish, too.  The chicken was as moist as could be and the and the spicy aioli topped it off nicely.

The last three savories all were amazing.  The Turducken pot pie with buttermilk crumble top was nice and creamy and the duck flavor came through the well crafted cream to the pot pie.  The Shepard's Pie 3.14 is a new take on the traditional pie.  Cubes of lamb, gnocchi, vegetables, and potato sticks.  Very creative and tasty with the rich broth.

I was completely blown away by the steelhead trout.  Although hard to say, this was the best savory of the day for me.  Cooked perfectly, the trout was moist and rich.  

Finally, the Banoffee Pie with Bailey's whipped cream and biscotti, was a perfect way to end this lunch.  I'd had this before and was glad to see it come back to the menu.

Service was superb!  New share plates were always brought, the staff was extremely friendly, and Chef Harwell was there to introduce each of the dishes and expolain how and/or why it came about.

This is a gem of a dining spot not just for Downtown Las Vegas but from any place in the Valley.  Carson Kitchen rocks!"}

   The third dish we got were the gyro tacos. And again, the flavor train came rolling through once more. I don't know who the conductor was, but the entire kitchen/wait staff do an exceptional job.

Now featuring the talents of Chef John Courtney for long enough that the menu represents a true collaboration between himself and Cory Harwell, it was as a group of six that lunch was enjoyed at Downtown Las Vegas' Carson Kitchen, an unseasonably cool and rainy Saturday doing nothing to dampen the creativity or quality of a new Spring Menu that is perhaps the restaurant's best one yet.

Familiar to locals and tourists alike, the small space originally envisioned by Kerry Simon still turning great business as rumors of others' struggles predominate discussions of DTLV dining, Spring 2016 is as close to a wholesale change as Carson Kitchen has seen since opening and with ten of twelve new plates tasted in addition to a seasonally updated Beet Salad it should go without saying that a meal whose only complaint was "too much mustard" on a slider went more than alright.

Dining with one longtime fan of the restaurant, plus four locals who had surprisingly never been, it was with carte blanche offered to Chef Courtney that seventeen items and two cocktails were served over a series of courses, ample descriptions plus top notch service no different than past experiences while several classics such as the chicken skins, bacon jam, oxtail risotto and Harwell's mac & cheese remain as delicious as ever.

Proudly discussing how longtime relationships with several local purveyors and farms have allowed the restaurant to maintain its wallet-friendly focus despite ever increasing food costs and rent that seems to stifle all but the most popular bars around, lunch began with a refreshing salad of white and green asparagus beneath creamy burrata and green goddess dressing before veering into "gastro-pub" territory with tender beef belly on rye buns plus a kick of cabbage partially drowned out by too much mustard while the follow-up of "Hot Oysters" was a daring dish executed perfectly as pork, chicken and bivalve were all delicious and crispy dredged in fiery Crystal-infused sauce.

Extinguishing the heat with a pair of Gin-based Cocktails, the 68+1 particularly noteworthy for those who want something sweet and smooth while The Magarian is a refreshing sort of drink that puts spirits in the spotlight, nut-free Pesto Marghertia Flatbread proves a veritable ode to basil as herbal aromatics greet the nostrils from several feet away beneath thick slices of skinless tomatoes and puddles of ricotta, undoubtedly a great vegetarian option for those who may not be keen on the concept of Bacon Jam...as silly that may seem.

Whimsically offering up pierogis that seem torn between Eastern European traditions, Flattop steak by way of Philly and "whiz" given a Southern pimento twist, the new menu's shining star is undoubtedly Chef Courtney's "Shrimp Dunderi" that marries snappy prawns to Parisian gnocchi in a citrus sauce bolstered by Calabrian chilis, each bite as sophisticated as anything being offered On-Strip or elsewhere in the city despite the mere $14 price point.

Having recently returned from Colorado it was with great interest that Carson Kitchen's Lamb Chops were presented alongside two classic sides and rainbow cauliflower that avoids the mistake of muting the crucifer by presenting it simply with a kiss of garlic plus acid, and at $18 for two "T-Bone" chops served rare with a pistachio crust over mint chimichurri the robust meat outpaces portions nearly half the size for twice the cost high in the Rockies, yet another strong testament to the quality of Courtney and Harwell's ingredient sourcing.

Forced to alter Bread Pudding since the closure of O-Face, and actually improving the dish in the process by deciding to dry the donuts before soaking them in custard, Harwell's Banoffee Pie and Bourbon Fudge Brownie continue to reign as two of Downtown Las Vegas' best desserts while the Springtime Rhubarb Sammy finally offers a lighter option to those looking for a sweet finale, the macaron shining in part due to Courtney's time working with Jean-Philippe but more so due to the sour rhubarb sorbet and fragrant elderflower whipped cream.

***** Recovering from a winter menu that seemed overworked and heavy handed, Spring has unquestionably sprung at Carson Kitchen and although old favorites remain as good as ever there is little doubt Chef Courtney has brought something new to the kitchen that continues to reinvent itself while raising the bar for everyone else."}

You cannot go wrong with this place! From the ambience, the drinks, the food, and the service. 

Honestly... you only have to try one thing here and it will just keep you coming back for more... and that's bacon jam. The flavor will linger on your taste buds no matter how long it has been, and it will have you yearning for your next visit to this place. It's like crack in a cast iron. 

I stick to my usuals because they never let me down
-macaroni and cheese
-bacon jam
-rainbow cauliflower 
-chicken skins
-ny cocoa steak
-strawberry cheesecake (insanely good)

I've probably tried one of everything on the menu and it's all good! Carson Kitchen, you my homie for life."}

Hard to give a rating since I didn't get to eat anything. 6 person table, 5 got dinners, 1 never came. I understand mistakes happen, but the restaurant handled it very poorly. Even after the first manager, the only offer was to comp the meal never received and then for a free dessert. Thanks for not making me pay for food I never got! And not really interested in dessert when I never got dinner. For what seems like a cool restaurant, I would have expected a mistake like this to be handled better. Was really looking forward to this dinner but now wouldn't recommend the restaurant.

Update: I appreciated a quick response by restaurant owner to learn more about the situation and try to make it right. Still frustrated over my experience since it seemed like there was little priority that night to fix a problem. A meal was missed and the rest of my party was long done with their plates cleared and still no missing meal. However, I realize mistakes do happen and I appreciate the owners follow up. Everyone else's food looked great - hopefully processes change."}

I don't always make it to all of them based on different circumstances (size of group, activities we're doing, etc) but Carson Kitchen was one of these places and I'm trilled that we actually made it! 

My boyfriend and I got to Carson Kitchen a bit past lunch time after a night of drunken debauchery on the strip and this place really soothed our souls and put us back at peace with the world. Let me start off by saying that the service was incredible! Everyone we spoke to was very friendly, helpful and the kitchen staff got our dishes out at lightning speed! 

Lets get to the nitty gritty of Carson Kitchen though: the food. AMAZEBALLS!! Per advice of our server, we ordered several different dishes to try. Everything was delicious! We ordered the tempura green beans with pepper jelly cream cheese, the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream, coco expresso NY strip with red wine demi sauce, black rice oxtail risotto, mac and cheese and of course the glazed donut bread pudding for dessert.  The portions were perfect for the both of us as we devoured about 95% of all the food. Our server even brought us some extra bread to make small bites with the steak and mac and cheese, genius! My boyfriend literally had his mind blown by all of the flavors these dishes had.

Carson Kitchen, I love you. Please come to LA. Specifically Highland Park so I can walk in several times a week and fall in love with you again. In the meantime, I'll see you again in March. I'm counting down the days."}

A few of my favorites would be the Bacon Jam, the shrimp, their Mac and Cheese is dang good. All their burgers are great and steak. 

I can't wait for this place to extend in the Vegas area. They need more locations for sure."}

I would give this place 6 stars if I could. It's a must try if you are in the old Vegas area! 

From the outside, it's extremely lowkey. You have to know it's there to happen upon it. Luckily, we knew exactly where we wanted to go. The inside is incredible. The tables, chairs, lights, etc are beautiful. It looks like it is straight out of an interior design magazine. I was absolutely blown away by it. It's also entirely open from the bar to the dining room to the kitchen. It's very small, yet quaint and cozy. 

The staff is spot on. The hostess was extremely nice to us and worked us in where she could since it was pretty much totally booked. Our waiter was also great. He went over the menu and gave great recommendations. I loved the entirety of the staff. It seemed like they were all best friends, and I would love to hang out with them. 

The food was AMAZING. It's all tapas serving style, so get several plates and share it all! We got a ton of different dishes, and I will give a brief report on each of them. 

The young beets has beets (two kinds), grapes, and goat cheese. I love the goat cheese, and the beets were really tasty!

The veal meatballs were also very good. They were spicy, but also had a sweet taste. They were perfectly cooked, not too dry.

The crispy chicken skin was a great way to start. They taste like really light fried chicken and they come with a honey dipping sauce. 

The pig and fig flat bread was not what I expected. It's like a pizza with fig paste sauce, pork two ways, and arugula. It was both sweet and savory, perfectly balanced! 

The baked Mac and cheese was INCREDIBLE. It was extra cheesy and creamy. I have no doubt it was the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Wow. 

The real star of the show was the glazed donut bread pudding. This is by far the best dessert I've ever had in my life. It was so sweet, milky, and caramelized. It literally melted in your mouth and left you wanting more and more. I may have shed a few tears eating it. 

Everything was presented in a very cool way. The unique bowls and boards were such a nice touch. Our check even came stuck into the pages of a book. I loved everything about my experience here."}

The set up is cool... small 2 and 4 tops around the perimeter and larger snaking tables that move into the bar hat are more "family style" which was cool, all 4 of us (me and the hubs + the two other people) were at the family style table and struck up some convo.  
on to the food
We had the crispy chicken skin, the italian sausage flatbread and the risotto.  
Now the hubs mistakenly ordered the skins thinking it would be a chicken finger-esque type thing.  They were spiced, not too salty and served with a dish of honey.  After eating the first i wasn't too sure, but they grew on me... sweet and savory, I would get it again.  
I had the flatbread, yummy, decent size... I recall it being called "spicy Italian sausage flatbread" without mention of the broccoli that was on it.  Very... Different... I tied it.. and ended up picking any of the larger pieces off.  
Hubbs had the risotto... Ox tail risotto.  Now being italian to me risotto is strictly made with arborio rice.  The end.  This was made with like a black wild rice... It had a bit more of  a bite than I would like, and that wild rice flavor... but was decent.  I would not get that again, but I know I'm very  picky when it comes to italian foods.  

Being monday afternoon I wasn't trying to get hammered, but did have the only apple hard cider they had, Ace i believe? It was the best cider I've ever had.

Last night we ordered the crispy chicken skins, rainbow cauliflower, shrimp dunderi, and jerk turkey burger. The chicken skins are served with smoked honey and oh so addictive. They are best enjoyed fresh as they can become slightly hard and chewy if you leave them sitting towards the end of your meal. The cauliflower was crunchy, lemony, and refreshing. The shrimps were huge and the dunderi was pillowy perfection. It's basically gnocchi that is made with cheese rather than potatoes. Need I say more? The turkey burger was the real highlight of last night's meal. The patty was huge and juicy. I totally forgot that it was turkey! The sweetness from the mango chutney slaw complemented it so well, I wish it had more.
 
I'd love to see this place expand to a larger locations. Not a huge fan of communal seating since I'm a lefty and always end up bumping someone's elbow. It's a small price to pay for delicious food. I'll be back!"}

Carson Kitchen's menu is refreshing and worth every penny. 

I was with a group of friends and everything we ordered far exceeded what we expected. We had ordered the deviled eggs and chicken skins to start off with. 

The eggs were so soft and very airy and the chicken skins were the crunchiest I've ever had. 

We each ordered different entrees, but we had ordered the butter burger, which was a perfect medium-rare, the chicken thighs, rabbit ragu, and the black rice risotto. 

I ordered the risotto and it was a smooth, creamy texture and the black rice was al dente, just how I like it. The rabbit ragu was hearty and the rabbit wasn't very gamey. The butter burger was juicy and flavourful and the chicken thighs with chimichurri were herby and light.

All in all, this place should be on everyone's list of places to eat. Definitely worth it."}

We were a very hungry group of six, who did a quick Yelp search and ended up here. So glad we did. Located in Downtown Las Vegas, Carson Kitchen is a classy tapas style restaurant. It is very small and can get pretty loud.

Roman was our server and he was great! Whatever questions we asked about the menu or any unusual requests we made (truffle ketchup), he delivered. In fact, everyone working here was great. I saw a lot of customers waving goodbye as they left, which tells me that a lot of locals frequent this place.

Their mac n cheese is my absolute favorite!!!!! Burger was also very good."}

At first I was put off by the communal table concept but after talking to the patrons around us and talking about the different menu items (and even sharing our tempura green beans) I realized how genius it is. I highly recommend the chicken thighs, tempura green beans (the sweet cream cheese pepper jelly is amazing), and baked mac and cheese! I can't wait to return and try more of the menu, especially the desserts! What a great addition this is to downtown!"}

Ok it is better most of the time lol.  My my " some things with mrs. P's) drink was refreshing and made to order,  less sweet.   And then to finish...... Brownie bacon ice cream desert.  Wholly cow.

The service was amazing. Super personable, funny and made the experience. We came deep and they found us a table very quickly. Bonus tip- they didn't take reservations, but they did allow us to call ahead to put our name in. 

Also, let's be honest. Downtown is way better than the strip anyways."}

They recently changed the menu and got rid of my favorite items "Burnt Ends". They now have a MMM Rib sandwich but without the best dill sauce ever it doesn't even compare. The other downside of Carson is that all the seating is either high tops or backless chairs so it's a hard place to take anybody with any physical limitations. I really hope they bring back the Burnt Ends or at least the dill/ranch dressing that came with it."}

I have only been here once, but definitely need to go back to try all of things I wanted to try but simply ran out of tummy room for.  I went with three other people and we ordered a bunch of things and shared.  We got the tempura green beans, jalapeño poppers, crispy chicken skins, baked mac n cheese, bacon jam, devil's eggs, and the chili cheese dog flatbread.  I think that covers it... everything was excellent and the standout for me was the tempura green beans.  Everyone in my group had a different favorite, though.  The crispy chicken skins were also awesome, but definitely needs to be shared between a few people.  I loved our server as well.  He was so nice and helpful.  The place seems very tiny for what I'm used to seeing in Vegas, maybe like 10 tables altogether plus seating at the bar?  We arrived at 3pm so it was kind of an off hour and we were seated right away.  I can imagine with how delicious the food is that there might be a bit of a wait at times during more normal dinner time hours.  The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs at work.  No secrets here!  The only bad thing I have to say is that one staff member who appeared to be a manager of sorts was kind of a dick.  We had requested some more bread for the bacon jam from our server and this manager guy was the one to bring it over.  He kind of flopped it on the table and said "bread" with a grimace and walked away.  I've had a couple friends who have also eaten here recently share about similar encounters.  Not sure what his problem is, but the rest of this place is redeeming enough that I would still come back and give it a 5 star review."}

There were so many interesting things to eat, we couldn't fit them all in one trip so, of course, we had to go back to try them all! 
The chicken skins were so good. If you like pork rinds, you will love the chicken skins. Not one bit of greasiness and the seasoning is so good. Not salty with a bit of spiciness. We had the bacon jam as well. It's made with jalapeños so it may be too hot for some people but it was good, I just thought it was hard to pair with the food we were trying to sample.

We came with empty stomachs on a Monday afternoon around 4-5 on Labor Day to try the place we have seen so many reviews about. We were seated right away and were attended to promptly. Service was good but the portions were very small compared to the price we paid and some of the stuff was a bit salty but the flavor was good. 

We ordered:

Tempura Green Beans: This was the absolute surprise of the day. Tempura green beans are exactly how they sound but the pepper jelly cream cheese they served it with was so good!. The creaminess of the cheese with the sweetness of the pepper jelly complimented the mild flavor of the green beans. Although a bit oily for me, it was nevertheless, my favorite dish. Good portion

Cocoa- Expresso crusted Steak- It was very salty in my opinion. The crust itself was very salty on the end pieces but for the middle slices, it worked well. The meat was good. I would have preferred it a bit more rare but it was good the way they served it. 

Rabbit Ragu- This was very good. The rabbit was cooked well with crunchy pieces of pancetta? or was it rabbit? Either way, the sauce worked well with the meat and complimented the spaghetti squash. Portion was super small in my opinion for the $12? $14 dollars I paid. If i really crave it, i would order it again but I think I'll opt for something else next time. 

Hawaiian Flat Bread- Flatbread served with spiced rum pineapple and ham, sprinkled with chives. It was alright. The pineapple was delicious. It was a very bold and sweet flavor. The ham however, was salty and overpowered the pineapple which was a shame. Also a bit pricey but it's Vegas so I can't say anything there. 

Overall it was a good experience. Good food although a bit salty and great customer service. Will be back to try other food on the menu!"}

Makes sense, it just wasn't my fav dish, but we ate it all. Feel like that dish needs some adjusting. There was a party of 3 behind me - they had a 45 min wait.. And there was a 17 year old with them so sitting at the bar was not an option. I told them to wait as it was well worth it, and there options on Fremont Street are not to be compared on all levels! Get here early to avoid a wait if you are hungry. The space is small - but functions, well. It was cold outside, so everyone was waiting inside, and I could feel the energy from the folks that wanted to get seated and eat. I could have stayed to enjoy another glass of wine, chat up with my friend, but felt bad for the hungry people, so we split."}

This place has tons of hype which may be why I found it so disappointing.  

Ambiance - There are only 4 actual tables at this restaurant all the other seating is at group dining bars where your legs dangle while you sit in their uncomfortable bar chairs. The first time I ate here we were seated at the actual bar and while it was very loud in the restaurant I was able to enjoy my friends company.   On my second trip here we were seated at the shared table across from a couple who had their tongues down each other's throat the whole time and a father who was lecturing his daughter loudly on how to make it in the business world and she "better shape up or ship out".  I understand this is not within the restaurants control however I would certainly prefer to have an option rather than shared dining but as a party of two we were not afforded that luxury. 

Service - The first visit they were busy but by sitting at the bar we were able to flag down the bartender to get our orders relatively fast. The second visit I arrived first and my server asked if I would like to wait to order, I informed him I would order before my companion arrived but I needed a minute to look over the menu. After waiting for him to return for some time I turned awkwardly around from my place at the bar extension to place my order for a drink with the bartender. My drink arrived but still no server so again I ordered our appetizer from the bar. The place was busy but there was plenty of servers and I spent the rest of the dinning experience hunting down my server. When it came time to pay I ended up getting off the horrible chair to just find someone to pay so that I no longer had to sit on those horrid chairs and I could get out of there. 

Food - The first trip we ordered:
Jalapeno Poppers - Delicious, I recommend them highly
Baked Mac & Cheese - Excellent if not a bit on the small side
Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto - Such high hopes, but way over salted and the rice was not cooked it was crunchy

Second and last trip:
Bacon Jam - Zero flavor, the best part was the bread
Roasted young beets - meh nothing special here at all
Pork Belly Carbonara- Again high hopes only to be let down, the pork was fine but nothing special the pasta was mediocre

The uncomfortable seating, small pretentious menu and awful service will keep me from coming back."}

Be forewarned this place does get CROWDED. It is small so they can only hold so many people in there. We went on a weeknight and it was packed. They have a really cute patio that is all lit up and is fun to go out and eat on or have a drink.

The menu may or may not change seasonally. Everything we had ordered was super unique and the taste test on it won 10 out of 10. We will be coming back here for sure. One of our new favorite spots and downtown fremont is not far so you can walk around that when you are done."}

Upon arrival on a Thursday evening with a group of 4 we were told there was a 45 min wait. No problem there at all. We know the drill and have eaten at many small and popular  places in the past. We grabbed drinks at the bar and snagged a seat by the super nice fire pit.  About 45 min later the hostess comes out and says that their larger tables are done dining but are still chatting. Again, I understand. I run a small business in the service industry myself and these things can be hard to manage. Another 20 min goes by with smaller parties getting seated one after another.  The hostess again comes and apologizes saying the other parties just simply wont leave.  After ten more minutes one of our guests actually kindly approached one group of guests at the bar and explained the situation and they gladly gave up their bar seats.  It is a bummer to have to sit at a bar with 4 people after such a long wait but such is life.  

Upon sitting at the bar it seemed pretty clear that the bartender either was having a rough night or just didn't quite appreciate our presence. However, the old fashioned she made for me was delicious.  That was about the only thing any of us enjoyed during the visit.  I was stoked to try the gyro tacos and was incredibly disappointed. The mac and cheese was pretty good but the oxtail risotto was pretty awful.  Sitting at the bar we struggled  to get our waters refilled and never got any sort of acknowledgment or apology for our 90 minute wait for bar seats after being quoted a 45 min wait. We just sat quietly disappointed eager to finish eating and leave.  I am not sure that I have ever left a negative review for a restaurant nor have I ever sent a dish back. Generally, I am pretty patient with mistakes especially when they are acknowledged, but I was shocked by the lack of hospitality we experienced.  It is also worth mentioning that while we were leaving, the party that was holding up the table was still sitting down with their food in to-go containers just talking.  

This place is cool and interesting but lacks heart.  It felt like they wanted our money and for us to "ohh" and "ahh" over their "innovation" but at the end of the day it never felt like the staff had any interest in making you feel comfortable, seen, or appreciated. While leaving this review I noticed the way the owner responds to negative feedback that he feels is unwarranted. I cant help but think that sort of culture is exactly what contributed to our experience.  Maybe it was a bad day, maybe this place is as awful as I think it is. Either way, I think there are a lot better places to spend your money and time while in Vegas."}

The burrata and asparagus salad (which also had summer peas and something else...fennel?) was fresh and perfect for the heat. The oxtail and black rice risotto was tangy and sweet, fun texture. The gyro tacos were a fun "appetizer" of sorts. We would have ordered a few more dishes if we hadn't have dinner plans already. Come by if you're feeling off-strip for a casual, chill atmosphere and some fun dishes.

The 3 small plates plus a drink was something like $70, I think, but both tummies definitely had space on our way out. (Space for... giant donuts next door, actually.)"}

HARD TO FIND The signage is very dark and the front entrance is on the north side of E Carson St between S Las Vegas Blvd and 6th Street. (not ON 6th street as the address might suggest)

ALLERGY FRIENDLY I have very severe allergies and we rarely eat out, but we were invited to Carson Kitchen with a group of 16 and it was important that I attend... so I emailed them in advance (as anyone with serious allergies should) and asked if accommodating my very abnormal allergies was possible. I offered to bring my own food or eat prior to the visit if it was an issue. They assured me that they could accommodate my allergies and prevent from calling attention to the issues during the meal. Emails back and forth followed and they worked closely with me in making sure all ingredients were safe for me. When I arrived early to the restaurant I introduced myself and the staff reassured me that all was set. Everything went perfectly and they were discrete and amazing. THANKS!!!"}

Used to not be a fan of "small/social" plates but I think Carson's is what made me turn the corner. Perhaps the best thing on the menu/best thing I've probably eaten in a verrry long time is the Bacon Jam. Sorry arteries. Served with some toasted brioche toast, it is just amazing.

Carson Kitchen has a really sweet and genuine staff with great knowledge of the menu (how its prepared, the ingredients that go into it, etc.) The food is strangely unique and everything is super tasty. I feel like the menu changes semi frequently, so I'll refrain from commenting on each individual dish.

My complaints:  
1. The setup - Come in the winter on a windy day and when the door opens, all your stuff gets blown over and you turn into a popcicle. Come in on a summer day and when the door opens, your stuff gets blown over and you melt into a pile of sweat.
2. Their prices - Carson Kitchen costs more than some places on the Strip! For me, that's what's holding them back from giving them five stars."}

The beet plate, oxtail risotto, and donut bread pudding continue to be the amazing classics that they have been since opening. Today I tried for the first time their Mac, shrimp app, and pecorino plum salad. The Mac is amazing, worth it (kind of wish I ordered the bbq thighs to pair it with). The shrimp app will be my new go-to here, it's a cross between Chinese take out honey walnut shrimp and nachos in the best way possible, amazing. The salad, though something that did not expect - I was hoping for something presented like the beet plate - was very fresh and flavorful (amazing date vin) but in my opinion portioned poorly for the 13 dollar price.  

Past experiences: I've been coming here on and off for over two years and I've tried a lot of dishes some of which have stuck to the menu. Most importantly of which is the coffee rubbed strip, which is one of best pieces of steak in town, especially considering the price. If you're really hungry and don't mind something super rich I also recommend the bacon jam, it's unusual compared to other iterations I've had - note that it's huge, too much for two people in my opinion. 

Also something that I've tried a lot of are all of the cocktails here, all of which are great. This is one of the best cocktail programs in town for sure. 

I wholeheartedly suggest visiting here. Good food and great vibes, it's made to become your regular place for get togethers or just grabbing a drink and a bite."}

We ended with the fudge brownie with bacon bourbon ice cream. Flawless meal from start to finish. We'll be back! Thanks again Bianca, you helped us end a rough day on a positive note!"}

Legit food, solid drinks and chill kick back atmosphere. Tucked away  in DTLV near other new little hot spots around the Fremont area is this awesome little Resturant. Driving by you would know much of it but step inside and you will find yourself in a hip cool Resturant. 

It's not that big but not that small either with a great bar and a cool little kitchen counter type thingy. Prior to coming here I've been doing my homework and had a list of items that I wanted to try but bringing that that would be almost their entire menu I had to pick and choose. 

So here is what I went with 
Their signature Bacon Jam- 3/5 good great concept but it wasn't my favorite or I won't rub tho back for it. You must try at least once for yourself to judge if you are crazy about it or not. 
The deviled eggs-5/5 some might say it's just like any other deviled eggs and I might agree but the texture of the egg was perfect and I love the fact that they classed it up with the caviar and the pancetta added the right amount of crispy fatty goodness I loved it. 
The truffles mac and cheese- freaking 10/5 no really it was so cheesy with the right amount of truffle flavor you can't go wrong. It's more like crack and cheese instead of mac and cheese! 
Finally we has the Butter Burger w/spicy tots-5/5 it was so freaking good. Burger was so juicy and had amazing flavor topped with all kinds of cheese and veggies. The bun was delicious and toasty and the spicy tots were crispy and season so good that plate also was on point.

For the {Libation} "because no good love story or any story begins with someone ordering a salad" we ordered the Magarian drink which had a bunch of stuff in it but it had me at cucumber soda and gin...the most refreshing drink ever with a great flavor of lemon, honey syrup and a hint if thyme who wouldn't want to just drink that all day in the hot summer heat then we got the St. Stephane's Belgian Blonde beer. All beer are in bottles nothing on tap but who cares when they are all so good. 

All in all I can't wait to come back and try everything else like their chicken skins and their beef Wellington empanadas plus sip on their other Findlay crafted drinks."}

The Oxtail Risotto (if there's risotto on the menu, I know what I'm getting, and THIS is the best risotto I've had thus far...so that says a lot), the Deep Fried Chicken Skin, and the Bacon Jam. *cue in tears of joy*

The service, the ambiance...ah, yes. I've taken a couple of my friends here as an introduction to the DTLV scene, and so far so great with their reaction. I've had one friend order the Beef Stroganoff, another the Rabbit Ragu. Both enjoyed their dishes quite a lot.

Bottomline, love this place. 5 stars for sure."}

The restaurant is one of many that are owned by the late Celebrity Chef Kerry Simon and it is one of the select few great meals that I have had at a well known chefs place in Vegas.  Carson kitchen is hidden away on Carson and 6th street and was so hidden that our cab driver actually had a hard time finding it and dropped us off almost two blocks away. After a few minutes walking around a rather sketchy part of town we finally noticed the name painted on a window and knew we had found the right place.  Once inside you will find a small dining area with nothing but family style seating. You will have two options...snuggle up and make some friends or go someplace else. I would suggest make some friends because you do not want to miss any of the food that is about to be placed in front of you. Everything on the menu sounds mouth watering good so it was hard to decided on just a few choices. My wife and I decided to go with three sharing plate choices and then a dessert. We started off with Bacon Jam and Grilled Baguettes, then Fried Tempura Green Beans, Fried Chicken Skins and then finished it all off with Doughnut Bread Pudding. The small size of the sharing plates did not matter as the huge flavors more then filled us up.  Like many before me, the highlight of the meal was the sweet and luxurious Bacon Jam. I was smart and ordered extra baguette bread so that none of it would go to waste. The jam was insanely smokey and sweet but with a slight kick of heat that hit the tongue right at the end. There were hunks of bacon and onion laced throughout it and it was capped off with creamy Brie Cheese. Unbelievably decadent and good. Nothing after that could really compare to the bacon jam but it was all very good.  The Chicken Skins were airy and crispy with a flavor and look reminiscent of pork rinds, they were served with sweet honey for dipping. The Tempura Battered Green Beans were crispy and not at all greasy and were served with a mildly spiced red pepper jelly. I would be lying if I said I didn't dip them both in my Bacon Jam.  Dessert can best be described as sex on a plate. Doughnut Bread Pudding that was made with a fresh Honey Glazed doughnut from the bakery right next door. The sinful donuts are baked in an egg custard and then topped with a sweet spiked Bourbon and Honey sauce. The waitress actually threatened to steal the dessert leftovers from us (and judging by the look in her eye she was not kidding) so we were obliged to finish the entire plate of happiness. This was such an amazing meal that I have no choice but to give it 5 stars. It is a fitting tribute to Kerry Simon and his culinary talents."}

For dessert we tried the Bourbon Brownie and Glazed Donut Bread Pudding. The bread pudding is redonkulous! 

The only thing that kept this experience from being 5 stars is Chef Mutton Chops yelling at the sous chefs right in front of us. We had been watching them the whole time and they were doing an excellent job and it just wasn't cool seeing him come down on them. Not very professional and left us with a little bit of a bad taste in our mouths. Still gonna come back for that bread pudding, though."}

This was my second Vegas visit where our team incorporated Carson's- and it won't be our last. 
We waited about 15 minutes before they were able to seat us. No big deal, we cozied up to the outdoor fire pit, and laughed, drinks in hand.
Upon being seated, our server set us up with a fresh round of drinks. I had been elected to place our tables order. (This is trouble)
There were seven of us, so we ordered a ton:
Fried chicken skins: ok, hear me out on this one. I'm fully aware that chicken skins are the least healthy party of the chicken, but equally, they may be the most delicious. Especially when you deep fry them, and serve them with a smoky honey. (I love honey!)
Three different burgers: butter, bison, not sure the last. that we cut like a pizza and shared. The sweet potato tater-tots were a table wide hit.
Bacon Jam (this is an epic dish of bacon, some fruit, and Brie that you spread on crispy bread slices). Highly addictive. Completely unhealthy, totally worth it.
Spicy shrimp: crispy and coated with a spicy mayonnaise, these were a popular, rich treat.
Truffle Mac and cheese: mind blown- this was amazing. Unsurpassed deliciousness coated in cheese and baked to nice brown top. 
Braised pork belly: this was a close second to the Mac and cheese. Very close. It was succulent, tender, flavorful and I had more than my fair share ;)
Tri-color cauliflower: this was tangy and a wild adventure. Also, the healthiest thing we ordered.
Gyro-tacos: sounded weird, but these were superb. Flavorful meat, and the prefect tzatziki sauce.
Wild mushroom flatbread: perfectly crisp, great portions of toppings and yummy!
I was a few Tito's and cranberry in, so I'm not sure if I missed anything else. I feel like I may have excluded something.
Oh, then dessert. Bread pudding Bacon Icecream. (Never had anything close) The chocolate cake, also amazing. 
As you can gather from reading the above, we enjoyed everything, and still kept eating. Tales of my dietary trespasses here will forever be told- and I'm not ashamed of any of them!
Highly recommend this off strip gem!"}

Gyro tacos- perfectly cooked and the meat was delicious

Macaroni and cheese- you must order this.  Just trust me.

Burnt ends- we are from an area where BBQ is taken very seriously.  These were on par with a good BBQ restaurant back home.

Deviled eggs- reminds you of childhood.  Yum!

Located right in heart of the revamped DTLV, behind the eclectic famous "Fremont street", Carson Kitchen is hidden with no large sign, the food speaks for itself. 

 As we walked in we were greeted quickly by the hostess. Very nice, sleek, tiny restaurant with a cute small bar, open concept with views to the kitchen.

The food: small menu, small portions tapa style maybe? 
We got the...
Tempura Green Beans: good flavor not overly battered comes with a pepper cream cheese dip. This was good. 

Beef Wellington Empanadas: 2 in a order, not bad flaky crust comes with a sherry sauce? Idk but this was nice. 

Crispy Chicken Skins: comes with honey dipping sauce. Think of fried pork skins.. Super crispy, this would go excellent with a nice cold beer. Good flavor, a bit on the salty side. I feel like this didn't need the seasoning really. 

Caribbean Jerk Turkey Burger: eh I didn't like this. Maybe the fact that I don't really care for cole slaw, which by the way was the only thing in it. Burger became soggy. It had a pumpkin spice kinda flavor and it was kinda sweet ehh.. 
 
I liked when each item came to our table the server described what it came with. The food came out in good timing. We were there for probably just 45 mins. 
The service was good she checked on us a few times. This place would be great after a night of drinking and you want something good, and savory! But they close early in Vegas standards at 11pm. 

I will return!"}

Come to Carson Kitchen and see what Cory Harwell and head chef Scott Simon are up to with this dish named simply "Red Radish."

Four of us came here last week to sample some items from the new menu and as usual, the fare is creative and very tasty.  Here is a list of what we tried with the menu descriptions:

Cheese and crackers--piquillo pub cheese, lavash
Pork wings--buffalo bleu beurre blanc
Plum and pecorino--candied almond, rosemary date vin
Crispy chicken skins--smoked honey
Peach panzenella--tomato, zucchini, tomato peach vin
Everything bagel flatbread--smoked salmon, cream cheese mascarpone
Black kale and watermelon--manchego, walnut, lemon mint vin
Wild mushroom flatbread--tikka masala, smoked mozzarella
Red radish--baby bok choy, miso honey butter, cashew
Sugar snap peas--smoked paprika butter, harrisa cream
Lamb spiedies--house giardiniera, garlic aioli
Chicken thighs Alabama--white barbeque
Peach upside-down cake--crafthaus zitrone, whipped mascarpone
Bourbon fudge brownie--brown butter bacon ice cream

Each time I come here, I am amazed at the creativity of the menu items.  There are a number of new things here.  The two new salads--plum and pecorino and peach panzenella are excellent.  The black kale salad needed more watermelon for my taste.  

The two flatbreads were great with my favorite being the everything bagel with its smoked salmon, cream cheese mascarpone, and crispy poppy seed flatbread.  What a great combination.  The red radish.  I have to mention it.  The flavor that you get from cooking the radish changes it somewhat so that with the bok choy, miso honey butter, and cashews, it becomes a dish that brought a smile to my face.  I said something to the table along the lines of, "Who would have thought of cooking radishes?"  

Ending the tasting--all dishes were shared by the four of us--were the desserts; one new and an old standard.  The new peach upside-down cake is excellent.  The old standard--bourbon  fudge brownie--is always good and should always be on the menu!  Service was exceptional as always. 

I have been to Carson Kitchen several times and I'll keep coming back."}

Water was served almost immediately and the waitress was really nice. She wasn't too pushy and was there when we needed her. 

I ordered the coffee rubbed ny steak for $19. It's not pricy for red meat but it came with nothing else. Only meat. By far not the best steak I've had. I didn't taste any coffee but was happy that it came out medium rare like I asked for. I also tried my friend's beef stroganoff which I did not like. The portion size was super small and to me it tasted oddly like chocolate. 

I also tried the bison sliders. They were a little dry but I enjoyed the flavor of the meat and the sweet jam it came with. All burgers and sandwiches came with a side of spicy tator tots which were delicious!  By far the best thing there. I also tried the lamb gyros. For $10 bucks you get three gyro tacos and they were pretty yummy. Best bang for your buck. 

The restaurant is small and can get really loud.  But it has a very cozy hipster atmosphere. I don't think I will come back again but it's a cool hangout spot."}

I can't rave enough on what an incredible dining experience we had here. Another yelper commented on how the restaurant and ambiance reminded them of being in San Francisco and I agree. I definitely didn't feel like I was in Vegas anymore. I loved the restaurant's quaint and modern design but I especially enjoyed the charming ambiance on their roof top dining area, the booths were very comfortable and there was just the right amount of lighting too. 
 
Now, let's get to the good stuff: the food! 
 
The crispy chicken skins arrived with a side of smoked honey for dipping = insane! Honey Boo Boo, this thing is real good! The skins were seasoned expertly and fried to crazy, crispy perfection; I couldn't get enough of that airy, crunchy skin - it wasn't even oily. Don't even get me started on the smoked honey -delectable- you can bet your sweet life they were meant to be eaten together. It's a must-order and for $6, the portion was perfect for two.
 
We also went all in on the bacon jam with baked brie and grilled baguette at $12, It's the most popular item on the menu and now I know why. It came out bubbling hot and was incredibly bacon-y, jam-y, brie-y, salty, sweet and, yes, it was pretty darn magical.
 
To offset the naughtiness that is crispy chicken skins and bacon jam, we also ordered roasted young beets with pistachio, mandarin orange slices and goat cheese at $8. The beets were roasted till perfect tenderness, naturally sweet, and the dish was simple but very tasty. It was the perfect option to complement the richness of the bacon jam.
 
We also grabbed an order of the black rice and oxtail risotto with Parmesan cream for $14, though, we thought it was way too cheesy (if that's even a problem?) Based on the menu description, we were expecting more of a smoother Parmesan cream-like consistency, but we ended up with more of a dense, stringy texture. Our waitress was wonderful and could tell that we weren't too thrilled with the consistency when she checked on us, so she generously offered to replace the dish with something else that we would be able to enjoy. We decided on the rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash and Parmesan at $12 - everything on this dish was seasoned very well; I also really enjoyed the light tomato cream sauce and the perfectly cooked spaghetti squash. Surprisingly, the overall dish wasn't too heavy. I personally wouldn't order it again, (rabbit is just not my thing) but my boyfriend went to town on it and really enjoyed it. 
 
I'm completely satisfied with the level of service and care that we were offered here. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything we ordered, plus the simply tasty food is well worth a quick return! I can't wait to come back and order some more of those chicken skins all to myself!"}

It wasn't what I was expecting, but I'm glad we stayed.  It's a pretty small place and it's a lot of open/social seating so don't be surprised when they sit you next to other people.  Also, it's more of a small plates type place.  I recommend planning to share and spending a decent amount of cash.  I had glanced at the menu so I was expecting $15-20 a person, but realistically $30-50 a person will be a more enjoyable experience.

Everything we ordered was great.  I devoured the veal meatballs.. sooo much flavor.  I wish it would've came with more.  The secret sunday chicken sandwich was very tasty and I recommend that as well.  And you must finish with the glazed donut bread pudding.  It was so delicious!  We also ordered some german potato salad, cauliflower, and a pork chop as well.  Those were all great, but not as highly recommended as the options I mentioned previously.

Get here early if you can. I would imagine this place would be pretty hard to come to with a large group.  This place should be on your must-try list."}

I admit 2 stars may be somewhat harsh just because I didn't "get" the vibe of the restaurant. I added another star for the obvious (and it is obvious) effort the owner is putting into customer satisfaction.

Local old fart here - I found this place to be more "hip-to-the-skip" than a restaurant with substance. The food is overpriced for the uniqueness it's trying hard to achieve. Granted, I only ate here once during lunch...ordered the Pig & Fig, but I found the entire experience to be "meh". The balance of flavors was off in a potentially delicious fare - the sweetness of the fig overpowered the pork and goat cheese. Staff was friendly enough yet it felt superficial. Sorry, just not a fan."}

Authentic food, good service and not a rip off. We came here during Life if Beautful weekend for lunch. We sat on the upstairs open air patio which is nice to do in Vegas when weather permits.

We had the truffled deviled eggs (delish and good portion) to share. My wife got the beet salad which was well made and just enough to hold her over for dinner. I got the lamb tacos, which were also delicious, however the amount of meat was not nearly enough to satiate me.... I was a little hungry when we walked away. That is my only complaint.

They had some create cocktails and a decent beer/wine list. I had the malbec ($9) and it was decent. If you are looking for something unique and tasty, I recommend giving this place a shot."}

Didn't have room for the Mac'n'Cheese and this is not normally my dish, but it looked great and we'll be coming back to try it

It was a little cold outside so we opted to sit inside, which was awesome as the environment is groovy. BUT, definitely going back when it's a little warmer to sit outside upstairs, a great, fun space.

If you're not sure - GO, you enjoy it.

Also, Apple Pay. Love it."}

We ordered the gyro tacos, which were so savory and tasty.. These were probably my favorite items we ate. Get these if you come here! :)  Tempura green beans were a hearty portion and came with a great dipping sauce, but our favorite veggie dish was the rainbow cauliflower.  So good! 

Catfish sandwich was filling without feeling heavy, which I liked... The bread was crispy and the fish was flaky, light and well seasoned and the spicy tater tots were delicious!!!

My least favorite dish was the pesto flatbread which was a little on the heavier/salty side for my taste, but all around, this was a great dining experience here and I would definitely recommend giving it a try!"}

I am normally not searching for fancy restaurants when I am downtown but I will make a point to come back here. Its behind the strip so you aren't overloaded with all of the mess there but just close enough to safely walk. It is definitely not for large groups as the seating is small tables for about 4 or so. 

The beer and wine list is a great selection. I had a glass of rose that was crisp and not too sweet. They have beer from the local brewery Big Dog as well which is a great touch. I will say the beer options are limited for non IPA lovers so be aware of that. We each had a couple of different appetizers to share and none of them were disappointing. Between all of we shared the chicken skin, bbq burnt ends, bacon jam, and pig & fig flatbread.

All of the food was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The chicken skin was addictive on its own but add the honey and its so many flavors in each bite. The burnt ends were flavorful and just sweet enough with the sauce being the stand out part. Now the best for me was the pig and fig flatbread. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and paired great with the goat cheese. It was salty sweet and just a bit tart. Get this when you go here. 

Also on top of all of this the staff was amazing. We showed up with a large party not knowing the layout of the restaurant and had to wait a while. With all of the confusion and miscommunication the staff was A+ with service and made sure to make up for any of the confusion on our part."}

The place is pretty hard to spot, but don't let that turn you away. It's worth the search! 
Lots of street metered parking available- you don't need to go back to your original meter to add time to it. Any of the meters downtown let you add to your specific spot-just don't forget to keep the receipt with lot/space number on it! 

The restaurant is small and cozy with a full view of the kitchen. It was pretty packed on a Saturday morning- it's not a place you can go to sit and read for hours. 
We ordered the thai chicken flat bread. Not spicy, perfect size for two, not heavy on the cheese. 4/5
The spicy shrimp was a 5/5 for me. Perfect combo of sweet and spicy. 

I don't have an issue with this but.... A couple came in with two screaming kids and were given cold looks from other customers throughout their meal. "Why would you bring your kids here," was said by the couple across from them multiple times and loud enough for them to hear. Carson Kitchen might not be the place to bring them."}

The spicy tots that came with it were also great, maybe the best tots I have had in a LOOOOOONG time. The cauliflower was good, but some pieces were cold in the middle, not really a game changer because at least they weren't mushy but a little, I don't know, weird? Super garlicky for sure, so prepare yourself for that. The short rib grilled cheese was good but I almost feel like I would have rather just hunkered down with the chicken sandwich. I am probably going to have dreams about that sandwich now... mmm... chicken....

Chicken:
Chicken thigh that's simple but tasty. The skin is crisp but not overcooked. It's quite juicy. I paired this with their broccoli which was a bit spicy 4.5/5

Rainbow Cauliflower:
This is my favorite item on the menu. I never thought I'd say that the best dish I've had was a bowl of veggies let alone cauliflower! What crazy friggin ish is that? As a matter of fact, I crave a bowl all the time now. Garlicky, a bit of spice and a bit citrusy. I could eat this all day. A glowing 5/5

Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak:
Tender slices of beef with pink on the middle. Earthy and nutty because of the cocoa espresso but without being bitter. 4/5

Swordfish: 
Flaky white fish with lemon, mint and basil. Refreshing, light and delicious 5/5

Young Beets:
I don't normally get too crazy over beets. The texture is mushy and tastes like dirt - CK was able to make me like beets. 4/5

Gyro Tacos:
Greek tacos with tender meat, feta and onions. Nothing complicated here. 4/5

Chicken Skin:
Comes with honey to dip the crunchy salty goodness that is chicken skin. Forget your healthy eating habits for a moment and indulge in this basket of magnificence. *crunch crunch crunch crack crack crack* was all I heard when this was brought to our table. 5/5

Tomato Stack:
Caprese salad, basically. 4/5

Mac n Cheese:
I don't know how they made such a simple comfort food to be better than most places. The crispy top, the creamy cheese sauce...yuuuummm!!! 5/5

Devil's Eggs:
Deviled eggs with caviar and pancetta. Absolutely delicious. With the caviar and pancetta, I thought this would be salty but I was wrong. Different textures in my mouth. 4.5/5

They have a few tables by the window, a few stools by the kitchen and by the bar, and a community table. They also have outdoor seating. This is one of my favorite spots in Downtown Las Vegas."}

-There is limited seating so recommend your party is limited to four
-Update: There is an upper level that can accommodate 50-60 people!

Service 2.5/5
-Service was friendly but my water was empty for a while

Food 1.5/5
-Crispy Chicken Skin was tasty and seasoned at first. Eat a few more and it becomes very salty quickly. I couldn't eat more than three without my tongue feeling burnt
-Bison Sliders had a mild game flavor and cooked around medium. 
-Gyro Taco was over-seasoned and very salty. I couldn't even finish one. The cheese overpowered the lamb, all I could taste was cheese. 

My whole party of four agrees that the dishes were salty and felt we weren't wow's by Carson's Kitchen. Definitely overhyped."}

It's a small sophisticated atmosphere with a casual attire ordeal. Typical art district spot. Which I like over the turn and burn feel of Fremont. 
The food was awesome. Great flavors and perfect portions. I ordered the killer shrimp and gyro tacos. Plus a drink called Ms that I could of done without. 
The  killer shrimp had a light almost like tempura batter with lime infused jalapenos. Mmm. The sauce on.them wasn't over powering and tasteful.
The gyro tacos were lamb and goat cheese with an awesome sauce. Need I say more. 
I should of gone for the good Rodney Strong chardonnay they had. The drink was ok but far to plain to be amazing."}

A few chunks of meat here and there throughout the sandwich. The service was great and our waitress was awesome. Maybe a bit too much hype about this restaurant set my expectations too high."}

We enjoyed it so much the first time, we came back with friends.   Located in an odd location in the Fremont area, don't blink, you will probably drive right passed.  Street parking near by is metered, so be sure to pay enough time so you're not interrupted meter feeding half way thru your meal.  

Restaurant was remodeled and expanded since our last visit.  Looks like they blew out the wall to extend the bar.  Funky modern vibe, lots of plaid and "a lot more ink, a little less sleeve" atmosphere.   The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs working their magic first hand.  As in any good chef's kitchen, noise was minimal.  No pots and pans banging about.

We felt the best way to experience Carson was to order a lot of appetizer bites for the entire table to share.   We ordered the bacon jam that's absolutely to die for yummy!  The Devil's eggs were good, but honesty....every picnic I've ever been to has their own rendition.  Theirs happened to be topped with caviar.   The veal meatballs with peas were outstanding!  Hard to have just one!  Melt in your mouth delicious.   Portions were good sized and enough for a table of 4 to share.  

One of us ordered the Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich.  Tender juicy chicken on an aioli smeared brioche bun.  Another at the table - dear Lord was on a diet in Vegas - ordered a Green Goddess Caesar salad.  

We all waited and salivated for dessert.   The Glazed Donut Bread pudding sounds heavy....but it's really a light treat. Caramel and rum covers a light fluffy donut.  Just enough to share with the table and get a few bites to satisfy you.  We liked it so much we nearly licked the bowl clean!  The Bourbon Fudge Brownie was outstanding!  Super rich dense chocolate flavor topped with ice cream and bacon bits.  Out of this world.   The desserts were by far the stars of our dining experience.  

The check arrived along with an "autograph book" of reviews.  Sign your name and share your comments of your favorite meal.  A nice inclusive touch to an exceptional and well presented meal.  Service was good and staff friendly.  We enjoyed Carson Kitchen once again, as did our friends."}

The tempura green beans & Mac and cheese were the table favorites. Everyone also enjoyed some spicy shrimp appetizer, the mushroom flat bread and the burger w/ spicy tots (the burger was HUGE). We ordered 5 plates to share and it was too much food. We should have only ordered 3. 

The cool vibe of bigger bar tables is fun but it's hard to share the table with other parties sitting elbow to elbow. I was seated next to a party of 2 who ordered multiple appetizers, which gave me very little room for my plate, let alone my drink & flatware. We could have sat on the patio but it was too hot out. Elbow to elbow is the lesser of two evils.

I'd recommend this place for sure!! It's a nice break from the typical noisy, tacky and bigger Vegas spots we've tried!! Just beware, it's kind of hard to find."}

We shared small plates of crispy beans, mac n cheese, rainbow cauliflower and deviled eggs - so even my Vegan friend found a couple of dishes she could enjoy.

I love the quirky decor and the outside area in the back. The drink list is good, love the mason jars and the fun cocktail names. Where Park misses the mark for me has been a consistent disappoint in food and service. It lacks the wow factor and the staff often at times seems less than excited to wait on you. Guess what people! We're not all tourists and some of us are looking for favorite places to hang out. Ignoring your customer or acting like it's an imposition that we would want - gasp FOOD for lunch - is not going to turn Park into our Cheers.

I'm a bit impartial on this place but with so many options in the downtown area, I think having a friendly warmer environment with better food would definitely change my 3 star to a 5."}

What happened on Friday evening was out of everything I have ever seen and heard. I understand that NYE/NY is stressful time being at work (or in general working in a place like Las Vegas) but wow.

We arrived with our group of friends (who had just gotten married that day by the way). We wanted to sit outside and out waitress told us that it is "no problem" and "we get the heaters for you, I'll come back when you have all settled."
There was a guy who was dealing with the heaters and one of the guys in our group asked "How long is it going to take, we are freezing? Just wondering if you need any help...?" The guy didn't say anything so we just assumed he was okay.

Service was good, food was good and we tipped above average.

When it was time to leave, two people from our group decided to have two shots (hello, they got married that day! Why not? :) ) 

This was when the "fun" begun.

The bartender told them "I don't serve you anymore. Get out of here." Our friends were like "Excuse me? Why?"

The next thing he did was that he asked the security guy to walk them out. Our friends asked again "Why?" since no one had said anything or done anything that would have been consider hurtful or out of order. 

The security guy had a HUGE ATTITUDE problem and after few rants he PHYSICALLY grab  one of the girls (waist) and tried to push her out. When her boyfriend was trying to tell him that he is not allowed to touch anyone (especially since she didn't even said anything, just stood there not understanding what's going on) the security guy said; "I CAN DO WHAT EVER I WANT TO IN MY BAR."

When another person from our group went to the guy asking what is going on he said to her that "oh bitch, you are with them too? Get the fuck outta here! You are not welcome."

Okay dude calm down. 

I feel bad for Park on Fremont that I have to write on Yelp a review since when I tried to complain thru phone the management (or how do I know if it was management after all, I wouldn't be surprise that it was the same guy who was working on the bar that night ha!) wasn't heard at all.

On Saturday 4/26/15, my two gay friends and I ate at the bar here and had 2 drinks each. Once we signed the bill and paid, the security guard asked us to leave. I said, "Excuse me? Are we being kicked out?" And he said yes. I asked him why and he looked a little embarassed and immediately said "Would you like to talk to my manager?" And I said yes. So a woman came up to me saying someone complained about us. I asked what the complaint was and she said someone was offended by us. I asked what we said or did that was offensive and she could not tell me. In the mean time there was a group of college kids with LSU t-shirts next to us cheersing shots and being very loud, and yet MY small group of 3 people who ate dinner and had 2 drinks was being asked to leave for being offensive! I couldn't believe it. And especially with no explanation. I will NEVER go back there and I tell all friends and family to stay away. Our waitress was nice, even the security guard that was asked to kick us out was nice, but the woman who said she was the manager was the one I blame for the offensive treatment."}

So hangry in fact, that after attempting to find a place to accommodate 10 people, most of the group headed back to the hotel.

That left 4 of us to get something to stuff our faces with. We went with Nacho Daddy which turned out to be an awesome decision.

It was not crowded at all on a Monday night, so we were sat quickly and placed our appetizer and drink order. We went with the pulled pork BBQ nachos, which turned out to be phenomenal. The pork was good (not the best I've had but this ain't dixieland), but the sauce and queso made this spectacular. Their BBQ sauce was very tangy, with just enough sweet and a little kick at the back end. The white queso was interestingly underneath the pile of chips and toppings but it works well as it keeps the slimy chip situation to a minimum.

Our margaritas took a while to obtain but were good. Mine was the house rita, which was a tad sweet but mixed strong enough and with fresh lime juice.

Everyone at the table ordered various iterations of Gringo and Street Tacos. I personally got the steak filet ones which were great. I would have preferred shredded cheese to queso, but it turned out ok. Others in my party were really impressed with the shredded pork tacos. Refried beans were on point as well. The Spanish rice was unimpressive, it was a bit overcooked but had the right flavor.

The only reason I gave this only 4 stars was because the bar was a little too slow in getting drinks out. Our server was awesome! We were given great recommendations and he took a few pictures of our group since we learned he's a serious photographer!

Should we find ourselves hangry or even hungry on Fremont Street again, this place will be in the short list for sure!"}

Which absolutely disrespected the shit out of my unprepared Southern California clothing. 

My comrade and self decided so seek shelter in a place called nacho daddy. We parked our steeds outside and approached the two far end seats of the bar "it was near empty in there". I started off as any self respecting male would. With a water on the rocks "of which I was heckled for by the bartender, but I didn't care because I was parched of my vast travels of the sema auto show." Anyway, After looking at my menu for all of 37.4 seconds I knew the tostada nachos were the meal to warm my near lifeless body. The friendly female bartender had enough of my shenanigans after I placed my order and slid me a Miller lite across the bar and said drink up. Little did I know this Miller would be the beginning of the end. As I finished my beer my comrade decided the remainder of the night would be spent with shots. "Jameson and pickle juice". After several shots "more like 7" along with everything else I had pre gamed with at a city called New York New York. Where we traded beads to a man in a type of chair with wheels and no legs in to get directions. l knew I had fucked up. The nachos were transported from the kitchen to the bar in a backhoe that somehow they made fit in such a tiny spot. I'm not a big person by any means so these nachos made my hand look like that little person from Austin powers. I didn't know how to attack this battle without making a huge mess or drawing attention to myself. I somehow managed to rig myself a harness from napkins and straws to suspend myself from the ceiling as to not make a mess on myself. 

Lol now that you've probably read the majority of this review I'll take a second to actually say the bartender was attentive, friendly/assholeish "in a good way" and the food runners were awesome as well. I recommend sharing the mound of happiness they call food with the duggar family because I barely made a dent in it. I've been to this location several times, they never give me a reason to not come back. The company was better on Fremont, as opposed to the overpriced hooker sitting  next to me at the bar blowing her second hand dick smoke in my face."}

They definitely have an eye-catching interior for their restaurant- nice patio, creepy-looking but trendy bathroom and wall decors. The patio almost made me feel like I was not in Vegas, but somewhere more tropical, specially with the nice breeze the weather gave us. 

They have a very small selection of food. I tried their monte cristo. The food itself tasted not so bad, but it would have definitely been better if they did not burn the bottom part of the toast too much. They tried hiding it but we could still taste it. The fruits that came along with them were really tasty though.

The service was very friendly, but it was slow. It took them too long to bring out our drinks and to even take our orders. However, it is a spot that we would go back and have a nice-breezy brunch."}

If you're looking for a place to get your nachos fixings, this is it. You might be intimidated by their options and combos, but don't worry, because anything you pick is going to hit the spot

I would definitely recommend the Golden Knights Nachos, and they're big enough to share! If you want something lighter, I'd recommend the fajitas for something filling and delicious. I always get a cold beer to compliment the savory flavor of the nachos, so don't be afraid to splurge! If you check in here on Yelp, you can get a free margarita with an entree!!

Anyone who is walking the downtown area should come and check this place out, you won't regret it, and you won't forget it

It was a light girly drink and I wasn't sure if I tasted any alcohol, but that could've been because I was already drunk. 

This place reminded me of Alice in Wonderland meets the Secret Garden. It was very cute. There's also a hidden smoking area where they have a teeter-totter which is pretty much always occupied. Most people were hanging out in the outdoor area rather than the inside bar area. Crowd was friendly and chill. It was one of the slower bars we went to compared to the other ones on that street.

This place is super cute and the decor is awesome that they get 5 stars on. Now, the food.. ok ordered a few things and it was good, not great but good. The presentation of food again is great the taste was okay nothing special about it but wasn't bad either. Drinks... I ordered a bloody Mary and this is where my major problem is, I read menu and I got the bloody Mary that was most expensive mainly because of the description it said fresh mix of tomatoes served with a pickled egg and a extra crispy bacon strip.... not what I got and this disappointed me. Mix is fresh as described and actually very tasty, egg was not pickled it was just a plain boiled egg not what menu said, bacon was cold and not cooked very well nothing crispy about it again made me disappointed. Service it was okay could use to pay a bit more attention to their customers and know more about what they are serving the bartender she lacked at know about the drinks they serve and their specialty beers. Overall not bad but serve what you describe otherwise it's not worth getting drinks there."}

We ordered the Vegas Golden Knight nachos which feeds  about two. It tasted real good but it was very skimpy on the meat. There were plenty of peppers, onions, and cheese sauce but just lacked the filet mignon. It tasted a lot like fajitas. For $20 I expected more meat. Anyways, I don't see myself going back due to the high prices but at least I can say I've tried it."}

I love the atmosphere and the free flowing aura of the place, but am not impressed with the food offering. The chicken and waffle sandwich is neat in concept and plays well with the finger food mentality of the place. The drawback comes in the fact that the waffle was almost soggy and lukewarm. The chicken is nothing impressive. The choice of sides are decent. We went with the potato salad and it was good. They use egg in the mixture and that was very good. As the night progressed I ordered the veggie pita wrap with a side of sweet potato tots. This was better. The warm pita stuffed full with cheese and a variety of grilled vegetables was much better. The fact that they were removing items from their menu left us with little to choose from kind of hindered the dining experience.

The garden seating is amazing due to its Alice in Wonderland-esque decor. I would love to go back and take everything in. Hopefully the menu will be hashed out by then."}

The best item on the menu, maybe one of my favorite things anywhere in Vegas. We would order several with our brunch and I would often order them to go home with me as well. Please, Please, PLEASE bring the Mac n Cheese balls back we can all enjoy them again! Coming from a long time customer. Even if it's only on the brunch menu. Thanks, hope you can make it happen."}

She took our drink order (one beer, one red wine..she said Cab was all they had..I said OK) she brought out the beer for my guy, he asked for a glass.. we waited and waited and finally he got up and found one himself somewhere at bar area...GEEZ.  Oh, did I mention, I never got my wine, but was given a glass of water. I ordered the burger with fried egg and a side salad.
FOOD #4 Stars-- YUMMY is all I can say about this burger.  Absolute perfection.  The side salad was fresh and tasty.
Yes, I will go back and give it another try.  Hopefully the next time will be with a different waitress."}

Perk three (last, but not least): friendly staff from the hostess to your waitress. The hostess helped my friend figure out parking in the lot next door, and the waitress made me feel comfortable since I had gotten there before my friend. 
As usual, the food was yummy! We had ordered the Garbage Fries for an appetizer. Fries were crispy and toppings were fresh. Then we ordered the Avocado Toast and Country Breakfast Burrito. Oh man...

Walked in at 5:40 pm and the podium up front said, "Seat Yourself Please". There were 4 of us including one teenager. After we sat on the outside patio, a young waitress came to us and seemed appalled. "Did the hostess seat you?"  "No, we seated ourself per the sign". She continued that they don't allow children after 6 pm (20 minutes from our entry time) even though we never saw any posting of the sort or could even figure out why they wouldn't let kids in to eat there, even after 6. We ordered after we convinced the waitress that we would be quick because of a later commitment. Dinner was, fine, nothing special. Fresh but didn't blow me away. At about 6:15 as the waitress brought the check, she tells me, "I spoke to the manager, and it's ok."  OK? Ok for what? We were done. Was she angling for a bigger tip because she "allowed" us to skirt this ridiculous, non posted, possibly made up policy? There are a lot of cool little places popping up downtown. Based on other reviews I've read here on Yelp for Park On Fremont, I think that some customer service techniques should be shared with the staff, if anyone there has the skills or cares to share them. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know or any customer that I may have in my limousine when asked for places to eat downtown. I think you have a cool place, I hope you care enough to address the issues you obviously have there."}

It's set up like a little park, it makes you feel like you're not in vegas anymore even though you're on Fremont. 

I've only ever been here for brunch as I generally avoid that area of downtown at night. I've had the monte cristo and chilaquiles which were both really good! There's no bottomless mimosas but you can buy a bottle of champagne and a carafe of OJ for rather cheap."}

Tonight we found ourselves out and about downtown for our friends birthday, and inevitably end up here to do this "Scorpion Shot."

I asked our server Aerrick what the spirit was in this shot, he replied "what ever you like" - well I tequila. The other 4 had Mezcal.

The whole time Aerrick was super awesome, he was friendly and didn't seem annoyed by our obnoxious birthday boy. He frequently fist bumped and was most definitely attentive. 

Our waters came first, as expected. Beers and margaritas to follow - and just after the food order we had our shots delivered. 5 shots down & A few entrees later we receive our bill. 

All of the Mezcal shots were $20 and rang in as "scorpion" something. And then there was mine. "Don Julio 70" FOR $29.

$29? Are you kidding? I drink 1942 at Goldspike for $25. Let me tell you that it isn't the price point that has me bothered, it's the fact that our server failed to mention the bump or that Don Julio 70 was all he had. I would've swapped it for Mezcal. 

I work in the industry and this is completely unacceptable. Lesson learned for this place - ASK PRICE POINTS AND CHECK RECEIPTS. 

Maybe this was just a button error, and maybe I should have said something... But after almost an hour with a bunch of drunks I was just ready to go."}

Came out for dinner with some girlfriends while we were all in town for a friends wedding and I knew I had to introduce them all to this delicious delight! We enjoyed our dinner out on the back patio, which I recommend everyone should do for the added eclectic decor! Treat yourself to a game of I spy with the people at your table to see who can find the most interesting pice of art on the walls haha. That evening our server was Erica, and she took excellent care of us. I got the veggie wrap with sweet potato tots, and OMG, you gotta get these tots! Perfect mix of sweet and salty as a side!  The wrap was really tasty as well, but I love these tots!  Everyone was very pleased with their meal and drink selection, and prices were really reasonable.  
Looking forward to coming here any time I am back in Vegas!!"}

It was on a night that I had dinner at Triple George grill, then we decided to walk around downtown. One person in our group suggested we go in here for a few post- dinner drinks, and I'm so glad we did.
We sat at the outside bar section, which was really nice, it was a cool night and a little bit less hectic outside than inside. I'm all for fresh air so whenever I have a chance to partake in food or beverage and mix it with fresh air I'm a big fan! 
I had a few vodka waters, the bartender made them quite delicious! I know it sounds simple but this is a drink that can easily be made poorly, either with too much vodka or too much water. These were perfect, mixed with that fresh air and good company... I truly had a great time at this place! 
Then, the icing on the cake is that there is a teeter totter around back!! It's in a really small area, but I sure am glad they fit in this awesome little piece of playground equipment. Just make sure you don't have too many drinks when you partake in this fun LOL. Playing on the teeter totter was great! I was laughing my butt off while getting to play on this piece of equipment that reminded me of my childhood, except now it was an adult version with drinks! 
My experience at Park on Fremont was a very fun one, I would definitely go there again!"}

They need to get it together regardless of whether they're having a bad day or not. Literally everyone working walked around without a smile on their face. I'm not expecting a welcome choir when I come in, but at least look like you wanna do your job.
Our server was Debbie, I joined my party late and had to wait five minutes before leaving my table and going to the counter to get a menu. And then I waited another three minutes at the counter while two employees looked at me and kept moving. I stopped someone and asked if I place my order there or if my server does it for me, and as if my question inconvenienced him, he said my server would do it.
Then Debbie comes to the table and without saying "hi, welcome to Nacho Daddy" or "hey, how's it going" or even "hi", she says "what can I get for you?" She REALLY made me wanna pay 15 dollars for two tacos.
She brought me water but didn't bring me a place setting. It'd be one thing if it was busy, but she had two other tables.
And then when we asked someone else for the check, because 4 out of the 6 people had been done with their food for a while, the guy said, in a hurried tone, "she's gonna get it, she's doing something right now."
Even if Debbie was legitimately busy, there still wouldn't be an excuse for the wait time of things & her attitude on top of that added to the not-so-great experience.

I don't know how my group was acting before I showed up, but even if they were some what of a hassle because they took too long to order, or couldn't decide or were constantly talking over each other, you're still in the service industry and your job is to put up with it and you deal with it every day, so buck up and deal with it. We all do things we don't wanna do."}

Even though the menu is short, it had many items to choose from.  I ordered one of their bloody marys (Texas Tuxedo) to start the night off along with some healthy dishes - chicken wrap & a strawberry salad.  Each of my friends ordered something different, that way we can try out more items on the menu to see what their BEST dish is.  Their steak salad was definitely more delicious than the strawberry salad.  The mac n' cheese philly cheese steak was very interesting.  Yes, very fattening and yummy!  One thing I would do differently (just because I'm really into texture) I would bake some Panko on top of the mac n' cheese to make it have a crununnnnccchhh :)  Their nachos was different.  They placed the steak flank and egg separately on the side of the chips.  I think for the night my favorite was their steak salad :P     

I love their back patio!! You don't feel like you're in Vegas.  There are just random stuff all over to look at and take pictures with/of.  I love the greenery and the lightings of the place.

The hostess made us wait 35 minutes, after telling us we had a 20 minute wait - the same table that was open when we got there was open 35 minutes later. It was not reserved and we had to ask to be seated at that table. We waited another 10 minutes for a waitress. We then ordered our drinks - it took 15 minutes to get 5 waters. The waitress brought 2 waters, then 1 more, then the other 2. The table was filthy and we had to wait more time to get it cleaned. Mind you, during this time frame the restaurant was not busy - there were open tables everywhere. We finally ordered and waited an hour and 10 minutes for our food, while the two tables surrounding us were seated and ordered after we did, receiving their food 20 minutes before we did. The two people at the table next to us were visibly upset that the waitress (same waitress as ours), forgot their coffee and a refill of chips for at least 15 minutes. After speaking up about our food not being served on a timely manner, the waitress was seemingly annoyed and very rude, stating, "I put the order in, there's nothing I can do," and walked away. Once we received our food she said, "See, it came." I'm absolutely appalled at the service, disrespect, and idiocy that we encountered. I will not be returning here, and neither will the other 4 people with me. This was a birthday celebration, a lunch that took over 2 hours to complete, and it ruined the happiness surrounding our birthday girl. Nacho Daddy can do better - get it together."}

Free Stoil drinks from 6-9 pm. Any kind of Stoli and they have great flavors. The bartender Cory was very helpful in suggesting a Blueberry vodka and lemonade drink.Service was excellent and we were not treated like freeloaders. Since it was open bar the place was packed but we never had to wait for service. The crowd is late 20's and up, professional and friendly. The layout is great for mingling. I love the decor and walking around looking at all the clever decorations is reason to visit. Make sure you go allllllll the way to the back behind the wall to visit the see saw!"}

We came here after the Color Run today, a huge annual event that brings a bunch of people downtown. Events like this means money makers for all the bars and restaurants downtown. When one would think a business owner would be prepared for a busy day with the rush of a fun loving, perhaps hungry and thirsty crowd. It would be a potential win win for the patrons and the owners. But apparently, our money was no good at Park on Fremont as my crowd was straight turned away. Yes, turned away. Apparently, this place just couldn't accommodate a party of 9, which included 3 kids. 

To back up, our crew was perhaps the third party in line before the place was to open for business. A couple of employees were clearly setting everything up outside to get ready. I asked one of the employees if kids were even allowed because I'm not some asshole parent who assumes every place should be kid-friendly, especially a place like this where it's generally meant for the younger, hip Zappos working brunch bunch. She told me yes, as long as we sat outside on the patio. This was fine with us, so we continued to wait in line. A couple of people who also participated in the event, were ahead of us in line. After about 5 minutes of standing in line, waiting, the same employee, who appeared to be the hostess asked out loud, "Are you all in line to get in?" The fuck? Was that a serious question? My brother, ever a smartass, replied with a "Oh, this isn't the line for Aerosmith tickets?" which amused all of us. So to answer her question, uh, yeah, we're waiting here patiently to get in as soon as you open for business, if that's okay. Then she made some huffy comment about how the participants from the event would have to sit outside because of the paint that covered their clothes. Hmm, okay? It's not actual paint, it's powder that doesn't stick to anything, but that's fine. I was already anticipating that our party would have to sit outside anyway because of the kids. She seated the people ahead of us, outside on the patio of course because of their Color Run crud painted attire. Then she came back to us and I asked for a table of 9. She seemed hesitant, put out even, and replied, "Uh, I'm going to have to ask my manager if that can be done!" Seriously?! I offered that we can be split up if need be, 6 at one table, 3 at another nearby. She walked away and a few seconds later she came back allegedly with her manager's answer: "Yeah, we can't do that right now, we don't have the space." You don't have the space? YOU JUST OPENED UP FOR BUSINESS! How do you not have the space to accommodate us? 

We had been standing there for a collective total of at least 10 minutes, I had asked ahead of getting up to the line if kids were allowed and if it wasn't the Color Run mess, it was the fact that there were just too many of us now. Yeah, okay sister! I'm sure if my party had been more "Park on Fremont" friendly sporting long beards, skinny jeans and it was someone's 21st birthday, a party of 9 would have easily been accommodated. Oh and for the record, there were 6 adults in my party, 4 of us for sure would've ordered some form of an alcoholic beverage, stacking money up on that bill for sure. But, okay whatever. You don't have the space. More like you don't want to serve us because we have people in our group who won't be drinking. Message received.

I have never actually been straight turned away from a business for any reason so this is a first for me. What kind of bullshit is this where a restaurant actually turns you away because your party is allegedly too big and seating can't accommodated, when they had just opened for business and there's clearly plenty of seating? And when you try to accommodate the business by offering to be split up, they're still not having it? Yeah, this was never about space. It probably wasn't even about the dreadful powered paint possibly rubbing off on their precious bar furniture. This was about the fact my party consisted of 3 kids which goes against Park on Fremont's credo of hip, cool young people who can order booze. The hostess and her snotty attitude would have been better suited to tell me that no, kids were not allowed. I would've been fine with that and we would have moved on, no hard feelings. But we stood there, in line for too long to be turned away because our party was too big and seating couldn't be accommodated. Word to the wise: there's clearly a type of crowd that goes here and it's not my type of people."}

Park on Fremont is a cool establishment. It's a little kitschy  and has an outdoor patio. I can't imagine the patio on a 120 degree day though, must be brutal.
The menu is comfort food spin offs while the drink list comes across as a joke.
I had a chicken and waffle sandwich which was  fatty and filling. I enjoyed a couple of their beers off their big beer list and enjoyed myself.
It's real good that Vegas has a place like this to change things up. Is it a sign of the times or is it a place that just found it's niche? Who knows?"}

Once we finally did, it took 35 minutes to receive our food! We ordered the queso dip (which we asked to be brought before everything considering it is an appetizer), but it came with everything at the same time. Also, the three tables that were seated at least 15 minutes after us received their food far earlier than we did, which did not make sense. The queso was good, but only when it was hot. After that it had some sort of funky after taste. The kale salad was incredibly bland and disappointing. The fiesta nachos were okay but not anything close to what I expected them to be. Overall, we left nacho daddy with queasy stomachs and had to end our night there. Definitely not how you want to spend Vegas."}

Not sure if everyone is drunk when they review this place or what but the food was horrible.  No one in my office was satisfied with their food.

We would take friends and family when they were in town so when a new one opened up, we were excited. The environment was nice, different from the Henderson location but that's expected because this is more of a bar theme.

The service was ok. They were really friendly but it took a long time for us to get our food. 45 minutes to an hour which is quite long. 

I got chicken enchiladas which I typically get at the Henderson location but they were not good. The tortilla was too thick, the chicken wasn't even shredded, more of chunks and the flavor tasted like it came from a can. The rice was hard and nothing to be desired. 

Chips were good but you can't really mess that up. Waiting for our check took a while too. Clearly we were ready to go and our waiter walked passed us multiple times without a check in his hand. Finally after bringing it by it took another 10 minutes for him to come get it and the card to pay, despite 1/3 of our party standing up.

Many groups came, ate and left while we were still waiting for our food. We had 3 people in our group so our order was not large. 

I won't be back to this location and probably will skip on the other location too."}

My wife and I were going to a concert nearby and wanted to grab a bite to eat before the show. She was in the mood for nachos, so coming here was a no-brainer. 

Upon entering, we were thrown off by having to seat ourselves. It was kind of packed, so finding a table in the back took a minute. There was a large party in the center that seemed to be taking up everyone's attention, so it was about 5 minutes before we even got menus and another 5 before we got to speak with our server.  Fortunately, that gave us time to decide what we wanted to order, so we ordered as soon as he arrived. 

It took nearly 45 minutes to get our food, but again, that was due to the large party in the center. The food was fresh when it arrived, but was mediocre at best.

 Her nachos were over-saturated with this extremely spicy salsa. The amount of cheese on the nachos gave the impression that ANY cheese on there was merely an accident. It was primarily a plate of chips and salsa, garnished with chicken and a few vegetables. 

 I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was amazing. The fries were great while they were piping hot. However, as soon as they cooled down, they became hard as a rock and hazardous to my health. I couldn't finish even half of them (and there weren't a lot to begin with).

 The part that gives this experience 3 stars (and not 1 or 2, as the food was quite a disappointment) was the service. Our server was Danny, and the little amount of service the party in the center allowed him to give us was excellent. 

Overall, it was a decent experience. Not one I intend to repeat any time soon, though."}

Overall it was good not great, I would recommend giving it a try if gastropubs are your thing, since there are not a lot in Vegas."}

Your response has two major lies.  #1 that my comments were very public, this was not the case in the least! The only person that could have heard us was your out of line bartender. #2 that my comments were disparaging towards LGBT.  Absolute lie! My comments were about why LGBT community continues to defend muslims when muslims would throw you/them off buildings. If that offends then you need to learn about logic. Stop with the cry baby nonsense and stop creating lies to justify the bad treatment I received. I'm wondering if Park at Fremont is part of the militant gay community and is all about shaming rather than open conversation.  I really feel for the poor innocent people at the Florida club who were massacred by a true LGBT hater last night. I'm curious if your bartender would stand up against the Muslim who killed these innocent people or only the harmless guy having a drink at your bar conversing with a friend? #realcourage"}

I've been here during the day and at night. The smoking area is behind all the dining chairs and fireplace. You walk back through a little side opening and there it is!!! The big steel adult size teeter totter!!! Almost every time I go on that thing and travel back to being a kid and having butterflies in my stomach and uncontrollable giggles. 

I've had lots of stuff here. The food is good! I love the cheer potato tots! They are so good and tiny. The chicken and waffles yumm! The mac n cheese steak huge and good!!! I can honestly say I've never had the garbage fries. I hear they are amazing. I haven't had anything I didn't like. 

One thing I do have to say. I have never had outstanding or even great customer service. I think the servers here do need work on customer service. Since a lot of us locals do come in. On several occasions I've had to send my food back because it didn't come out how I ordered it. Because they don't right it down. And they seem like it's an inconvenience to them to make sure we get our orders right. 

I've gone back and forth on weather to give this place 5 or 4 stars. I'd give the decor 5 stars and the food 5 stars. The service 3 stars. So I'm giving it a 4 star"}

They make their own margarita mix which was a nice balance of sweet and sour. 
Food was just ok. No free chips and salsa, have to pay for those. The crispy taco shell was not homemade, a little stale. We were charged an extra $1 for a small dish of salsa because the meal came with about 2 tablespoons of salsa. The chicken enchilada nachos were so-so, could have been better. Lots and lots of shredded chicken and enchilada sauce on chips but not much cheese or anything else.
We live in the Central Valley of California where Mexican restaurants abound and our expectations are pretty high.
I'd go back for a drink but can't recommend the food."}

The last time I was here was in the summer, and I remember thinking what I usually think about Park, which is: for a place that has so many mustaches and colored hair, they don't really have a good beer list. Needless to say I went back last night because of just those same reasons, needed a place to drink, that wasn't full of loud music... So I gave it another try, and I'm glad I did. The beer list has been expanded, and there are more really fun cocktails. It was a Thursday night and they closed around 11...

We visited on Friday lunch time. Got seated immediately. Most people there seemed like tourists day-drinking (must be nice!!), and some like us were there for lunch grub.

Their food menu is quite limited but very well selected. There's something for everyone.

We ordered Samurai Tots for appetizer, ham and Swiss Monte Cristo for my main, my husband ordered chicken and waffle sandwich.

Let me tell you about this Samurai Tots! First of all, they give you a lot of tots! Good enough for 4 people, I'd say. For two of us, honestly, we could've just ordered this and we'd still be full. 
I don't remember the description of this dish, but basically, it's Takoyaki, but tots instead of puff balls. Garnished with green onion, Sriracha mayo (could've been aoli, don't remember) and okonomiyaki sauce, fish flakes....I have to admit, I ate way too much. They're damn good!!

I'm a fan of sweet and savory, so Ham and Swiss Monte Cristo hit the spot for sure. 
My husband liked his chickenand waffle sandwich. It had bacon in it, waffle was semi crispy outside, soft inside. And that perfectly for crispy chicken.

Overall, this place serves great food, especially for a bar. I foresee myself coming back here for lunch in the near future, or for night-outs with friends."}

When you walk into this restaurant, you'll notice it has the cozy space of your local dive bar: a bar section along one side of a narrow interior and a row of tables along the opposite side. But seating isn't limited to this area - there's also plenty of space out front and out in the back [hidden in the back is a full sized see-saw (yes, see-saw)]. 

As I mentioned at the top, this place is a piece of art. It's like Tim Burton collaborated with an interior designer and suggested, "less goth more abstract," "mute the colors," and "throw in some flair shit like TGIFridays does." And so they came up with ceilingpaper patterns, fireplace beer taps, record player jukebox, taxidermy birds... I could enjoy spending all day just looking at this stuff... and eating stuff!

The eats we had on this visit were small and perfect for a casual bite. We got in around 6pm and it turned out to be happy hour, so we took advantage. I had the Steak Tacos ($6, normally $9) which came with three tasty corn tortilla tacos with salsa, guac, and sour cream. Also ordered the Garbage ($6, normally $13) fries, which can be substituted with tots or chips. It was probably one of the best versions of a nachos-style dish: cheddar & provolone, bacon, green onions, tomato's, and jalapenos. Great dishes at a great price. 

This was only the happy hour experience. I want to come back and try out the build a Burger or the Mac & Cheese Balls."}

I had the Kale Salad, it was tasty and refreshing!  The roasted corn is fresh and straight off the cobb. I also got the guacamole; it is fresh and simple. It's amazing how many people can mess up guacamole and Nacho Daddy did it right. It's chunky with hand chopped onions and tomatoes. Honestly it could have used more cilantro!  My husband got the Spicy Tofu Burrito, look out taste buds!  I didn't even try it because I can't do spicy but he said it was great but not for the weak belly!  Overall the experience was good, the chips were light and fresh but almost too salty. I will eat here again!"}

This restaurant has the fancy Ferrari designed Coca Cola machine so I indulged in a Cherry Coke. We decided to share an order of nachos, tostada style, and an order of grilled mahi mahi tacos. The tacos turned out to be one in the case of the fish option, but our server insisted it would be enough food. Our server and the others seemed very young and not supervised, but were all very smiley and all kept busy even though the restaurant was quiet. 
The food came out very quickly and was really good! The taco was my preference, I will totally order it again. A fresh flour tortilla, slightly crisper and loaded with two small tender mahi filets, cabbage, chipotle cream, salsa cruda. It was so delicious I almost couldn't stop eating at the halfway mark! The nachos were very good as well, loaded with seasoned beef, refried beans, Pico de gallo, queso and shredded cheeses, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, fried jalapenos. 
I highly recommend this place for quick lunch or late bar bites. Really accessible menu for picky groups. I'll have to try a burger next time for sure."}

Id heard great things about this place and told my husband I wanted to try it. We came in today around 2 in the afternoon, it wasn't too busy and we sat at the bar. I don't know the bartenders name but she was a young woman with red hair passed by us multiple times not taking our order. One time to ask for ids then walked away. A few times after that finally asked what we wanted and when my husband ordered a dos Equis she said sorry it's frozen and walked away. Another 5-10 min passed by and she didn't come back to us until we started walking out of the restaurant pretty annoyed that we had been there for 25 min and didn't even get a drink order in. The service is terrible. I can't comment on the food or drinks due to the fact we never got to order anything."}

This is a great atmosphere, especially when the temps are good to hang out outside. The courtyard like area outside is a perfect spot to go for a chill night out. Also, if you venture a little further outside to the back of the seating area, there's a doorway off the side that leads to a small area with a seesaw. The inside is nice too, but it's definitely a hipster vibe with crazy wallpaper prints and animal heads on the walls. 

The drink prices are pretty comparable to other places downtown, so expect to spend about $7/beer or $8/cocktail. They do have a "beer and a shot" deal which recently went up from $10 to $12, but still it's a pretty decent deal. They do have some good beers offered for this deal like Dog Fish Head 90 IPA, and it's not just well alcohol. 

I've only been here at night, so I kind of want to see what it's like here during the day because it seems like a nice place to grab a bite of food or drink in the afternoon."}

However, this spot does delivers on what it promises: decent Mexican food and great drinks in a fun atmosphere. 

The restaurant is pretty small, a fully stocked bar sits across from a stage next to a separate dining room. Nacho Daddy regularly features musical performers and artists which really helps reflect what DTLV has been focusing on for the past years.  The food is similar to the Henderson location, but seemingly in smaller portions. The street tacos are delicious and the Thai chicken nachos are a great twist and a must-try dish. Splurge on the deep-fried ice cream, its worth it!  The bar gets extra points for serving up margaritas in mason jars! Though the food is pretty good I thought it was overpriced; $14 for nachos? $10 for margaritas? Meh. 

Service was pretty friendly on our visit though the bartenders seemed to be slacking on the drinks. Our margaritas were too sweet and they weren't that generous with the tequila. Though I'm not opposed to future visits, they are more worthy places in DTLV."}

From the first step inside I was treated poorly, I was grilled by security at the door; why I was there, who I was with and where my party was at. We initially were sitting in the back but were not able to get service so we moved up front to the bar on the outside, service was better, obviously. Then more of our party arrived and the bar got over crowded so we moved to a nearby table that had just vacated, lots of empty cups sat on the table for roughly 20 minutes. We pushed them to the end and waited for service. The first time some man came to the table to inform us that we were at a "eating table" he began cleaning glasses and I asked for a menu to order food. 10 minutes passed, our drink were empty by then, a woman comes to the table and tells us "very matter of factly" that we need to order food or we have to move. We would have gladly stayed, ordered food and probably 5 or 6 more rounds but we opted to not spend our time where we would get crappy service. Just to throw it out there, this place was not busy, plenty of "eating" tables were open and with so many bars around you would think they would want to keep the business and not shu it away."}

I have to say, I will give it another try because that is my personality, I will try anything twice! 

The reason I am giving them 2 stars is because the Bloody Mary was delish! 

Our waitress was so rude I didn't even want to tip her; the place was very slow so we expected a little more service. I didn't realize at the time, they had just opened but that still doesn't explain the fact that the waitress was so bad-mannered. When I tried speaking to the other waitress's they were all the same way so maybe it is a prerequisite to work there?

The green sauce provided in a cup was as good as the authentic stuff from the local taco truck in my hometown. I split the portion with my wife as a small meal to hold us over for dinner.

   We ordered a few of the happy hour items and an entree. The food here was delicious street tacos might be my new favorites. The shredded chicken BBQ nachos were a hit. So we also ordered the shredded chicken street tacos I really enjoyed those as well. 
    Sometimes when you order shredded chicken from Mexican restaurants it's a little to mushy but this was cooked perfectly. 
   Dh ordered the filet street tacos and finished the whole plate. 
    This little gem had a yelp check in for a free margarita but didn't use it. I prefer strawberry and it was for a regular margarita.  We happen to be here during happy hour so margaritas were 5 bucks. 
    Big thumbs up and I would definitely return."}

It took a while before we were offered drinks and even longer before someone took our order. When our food finally arrived to the table, the waiter spilled red enchilada sauce all over my boyfriend's White Sox baseball hat. Another waitress witnessed this but instead of helping us out she told another waiter working on the other side of the restaurant who then proceeded to give us water to clean off his hat. We were ready for our check and couldn't find our waitress or anyone to bring it to us. Did not like our experience here at all and probably will not recommend or return."}

My party waited an Hour and a Half -- Not an exaggeration, we got there at 12:10 PM and did not get most of our orders until 1:40 PM. I say most of our orders as I did not get my order at all! The server/bartender just offered a lot of eye rolling and threw a lot of shade but never gave an apology, no I'm sorry, nothing but attitude. Everyone had separate checks and everyone prepaid and she made bank on the tips. I will never make that mistake again. She didn't deserve a penny! So at 1:40PM as I was getting my refund she rudely told me "I'm also going to cancel that order in the kitchen" like I was fishing for a comp'd meal! So rude, so slow, so bad, so long Nacho Daddy! Your service is in need of retooling and maybe a staff that cares. 
Update: manager contacted me just to get clarification on what happened then abandoned all contact with me. Once again I was let down and nothing was done to make things right. I am no longer surprised that the service was lacking as the manager had no follow through."}

The first time it was amazing, the weather was nice since we got there around 7pm. Ambiance is amazing and quaint and I really want this place to do well so that is why I'm writing this review. 

The second time I went there I went around 12:30pm and asked to sit on the back patio. That was a mistake because the sun was blazing hot and there were no umbrellas, fans, or misters. It's not even summer yet and the outside will miserably fail if something isn't done to change that. So everyone was moving tables and switching spots to avoid the sun. 

Which brings me to another problem that Park probably won't be able to fix as easily ... The patio side is up against an alley, where all the trash from surrounding bars is dumped. In the sun, the smell was so horrible I felt like I was going to throw up, I don't know how they're going to fix that issue. But you can't expect to serve food to people when they're smelling rotting trash. Revolting. 

Then, we ordered the Mac n cheese Philly and the bar chicken bites... But it took 55 minutes for the food to come out at 45 minutes for anyone to realize there was an issue with our order. A manager never stopped by to apologize and at the end of the meal they removed one item from our bill. 

I've worked in the hospitality industry for over ten years. I know it's not all the waitresses fault, however managers need to be more aware of what's going on in their restaurant. (I saw them dealing with contractors so I'm assuming they were preoccupied) ..regardless, get ON your kitchen and get the food out! The servers need to be aware of their surroundings, one girl passed us literally ten times and after we had already been waiting for food for 30+ minutes she asked if anyone has taken our order yet. 

I want this place to do well so badly and I'm hoping this review can be used to fix these problems for the future.  

One star for my previous positive experience, no stars for the remaining issues."}

It's bigger and nicer inside than I expected it to be.  I asked the server what the specialty was and she said the burger nacho so that is what I ordered.  The portion was very large and the chips were great and the cheese sauce was pretty good too.  The burger part was a chilly type sauce that you would find on hot dogs.  It wasn't bad but could have used a lot more flavor and some spice.  To kick it up I had to use a lot of hot sauce.  There were also no jalapeño peppers. 

My wife had the vegan tofu nachos and loved them but this is my review on what I had.  The bottom line for me is if you are a nacho place and some gets your signature dish it should be oh wow.  What I had was ok not oh wow.  Average ok place."}

That's pretty much all you need, really.  Go ahead, I'll wait for you to order and finish.

....

SEE?!?  Weren't those things awesome?  In any case, I am a fan of that particular selection, although their burger nachos and chicken fried steak/egg breakfast nachos are no slouch either.

A decent little location just across the way from the Neonopolis, and nestled well within Fremont Street, I liked the low-key vibe there, with their poppy music videos on the TV, and a pretty tasty Bloody Mary (also of note, their coffee selection is excellent).

The service is friendly and keeps tabs on you.  Prices are reasonable, and portions are BIG.  Come hungry, for they will hook you up if you are suffering any sort of nacho deficiency.  

In any case, I took it upon myself to visit this location four times over two weeks, if that tells you anything, and now that I'm thinking on it, some buffalo chicken nachos do sound remarkable tasty right about now.

They need delivery.  Because as strong as my need for nachos is, I'm not feeling the cold right now.

We need to work this out, Nacho Daddy...."}

I recommend sharing! But they we very good everyone agreed. We had someone get the Mexican corn & breakfast burrito which was awesome too. We had a group of 8 & eveykne found something they loved.

Plus I like Mexican food in all forms, so hanging out here should be easy. 

Turned out to be a good place to grab a solo lunch. I came in around 12:00 pm on a Monday and was just about the only customer in the place (save for the woman on her laptop at the bar, I really was it). Surprising, so I was instantly concerned the food must be bad. Or you'd need to be liquored up with a bunch of tequila to be happy here, which wasn't on the menu for me. Fortunately, the food did not disappoint but more on that in a moment. 

Let's talk 'bout yo daddy...

Nacho Daddy is larger inside than it appears from outside. There is a spacious wraparound bar and a separate dining area with plenty of seating. There is also outdoor seating with umbrellas, although they had to take them down while I was there due to excessive winds. 

Server Nicole was down to earth and cordial. She was training a new guy and he seemed to be catching on quick. The manager came over to say hello to me, his sole customer. : ) Nice touch. 

Oh and the food. I had the chicken taco and can honestly say, it was one of the best taco's I've ever had. They mix some kind of pesto sauce into the taco that complements it very well.  I commented upon this just before leaving and they weren't sure what it was, but were glad I liked it. Well now, I'm glad too. 

The manager's cool. The staff nice. The food excellent. The environment very comfortable. I'm not sure why it was empty both before I arrived and after I left. Maybe it's just a quiet Monday. I'll bet the place lights up at night. 

Definitely worth a visit if you're downtown. Lots of options on the menu. And if you like tequila, this is your place."}

This place has it all! And it's obvious by the how busy is was on a Thursday at 3pm when we showed up for a late lunch. I was initially drawn in by the substantial vegan menu. Vegan queso is no joke and it is very hard to find. Like an Asian Crested Ibis, it is a rare bird. Guys... they have vegan queso! I rest my case (my case-o?).

But, don't worry, meat-eaters, they have plenty for you too! And a wide variety, I might add. My boyfriend ordered the Lobster and Crab Nachos that were served on a large sheet tray. Those bad boys were not messing around. 

The margaritas were lovely. The service was nice. And I really appreciate the garage-door style window that was opened to bring in some fresh air and allow us to people-watch the passersby. I can't wait to go to Vegas again to get my Nacho on!"}

Hubby was charged $1.50 for a side of two corn tortillas.  I know the profit margin on Mexican food, there is no need for all of the minuscule charges.

To the owners:  Thank you for this gem!  Places like this are what us locals have been dying for!  Your restaurant is a piece art with killer grub and strong drinks.

Philly Mac and Cheese is the bomb! Drinks were delioucious! My only problem is they are so small and went down fast and the service was not quick enough to get another or another!

There is limited seating inside and out front, but the best place to eat is on the park like patio in the back of the building. The building is out of place for this urban setting, it looks more like a Southern California beach shack in the 1970's. The interior decor looks to be photos and art from a bad dream. The food and service is what makes the place great! Our limited exposure included the best fried pickles that I have ever had. The Old School Park sandwich was selected at the recommendation of the server. It included brisket, Pastrami, coleslaw and a few other garden items on a french roll. It would not have been my first choice based on the description if not for the recommendation. It was a great choice and I would highly recommend it. The service was attentive.

I have dined at the Park on Fremont twice. Once at night and once when they first opened at 11am. On both visits, I ordered different entrees and one standing appetizer: Garbage Fries. The Garbage Fries are amongst the best loaded fries that I have ever experienced. The mixture of two different cheeses, onions, fried egg, and seasonings make these fries simply decadent and an delicious indulgence that I have not found a comparable equivalent anywhere. They are a MUST ORDER item that alone make the Park on Fremont a required visit, even if you detest hipsters. 

The atmosphere is another plus. Though it certainly is designed and geared toward the hipster crowd, no question, it still provides a wonderful location right on Fremont with a great park-like patio that wraps around the restaurant. The rear patio even has a teeter totter for those wanting to feel young again. The people watching is phenomenal though you should be prepared to get stared at right back. The beggars are only a few feet away so that does detract a bit but nonetheless, it is still a great spot outside. The interior is hipster and whimsical with Trivial Pursuit cards on every table for entertainment and weird art on the walls. Overall, it is a great all around atmosphere. 

Now the negatives:

1. Though the garbage fries are incredible, I have not found any of the other appetizers or entrees to be that spectacular. The beef tacos are great but not a great value. The chicken and waffle sandwich is a bit bland and the sweet potato tots are usually lukewarm and an acquired taste at best. 

2. They do not allow kids to dine there after 6pm and prior to 6pm, they can only dine on the patio. 

3. Parking. Though there is a parking lot right adjacent to the restaurant, it is a paid parking lot that is privately owned. Your best best is to park at a casino and walk over. 

4. Though I personally do not find this to be a detractor, many will: this is truly Hipster central.  

Overall, I like the Park on Fremont. Great location, atmosphere and signature fries that are quite possibly, the best in Las Vegas."}

With all of the excellent food offerings in the downtown Las Vegas area, it is extremely important to put ones best foot forward on the food scene. There were several strikes for this restaurant in my opinion, the first being that as soon as my family was seated, we were ignored for at least 15 minutes. With the menu having been studied for at least that long, we were ready to order. The waiter breezed up, took my drink order for ONE BEER and left without getting the food order. The waiter breezed up with the beer, took the food order of filet mignon nachos and an order of shrimp ceviche. The sad nachos arrived to the table with very little cheese, drowned is a terrible sauce, low presence of steak, and sad looking guacamole. The chips were fresh. The ceviche was a no. All around...a no. No flavor, nothing, period! The avocado was fresh. Oh yeah, I wanted another beer, no one ever came back to the table. Once done with dinner, we waited, and waited, and waited for the bill. Finally it shows up and guess how much 1 beer, 1 plate of nachos, and 1 ceviche appetizer cost...OVER FIFTY DOLLARS! Are you kidding me!?! That's even unreasonable for Vegas! We weren't on the main strip. Not even on the Fremont Street strip. I do not recommend this place AT ALL."}

Just happened to be in Downtown on a sardine packed can of people kind of night. Decided to give this place a try. It's hidden a little bit off of the Downtown Vegas path. Dark on the outside a little hard to tell where to enter. We found it and were greeted and quickly seated. It was busy, so the servers were running around trying to keep everyone happy. 

Got our drinks ordered, and asked our server for recommendations.  He told us to get one of Nacho choices and the 2 most expensive were their most popular ;). 

Thanks to checking in with Yelp I got a free margarita, although in retrospect, I think it was virgin, because it just tasted like mix, no scent or taste of liquor. 

The food arrived in the expected amount of time. I got the Enchilada (chicken) Nachos. The portion was big, more than enough for two people. All of my buddies also got big servings and soon we would all be full, and feel like adjusting our belts to a more forgiving notch. 

The service was good. Like most places in Vegas the restaurant itself had dark floors that were a little sticky. The food was good and plentiful. Considering bang for the buck and without a 30 minute wait on Presidents' Day weekend we were satisfied.  If the buffet you wanted just can't be had or just looking for a quick meal, this is a good spot to fill the void."}

Some of the chips were soggy when first delivered to table, and not enouth spice to make them stand out, but otherwise tasty.  Good service and very friendly staff."}

We got the trio of queso, salsa and guacamole. It was delicious! I could've just eaten that. Probably the best queso I've ever had. They make it fresh daily. So good!! The free house margarita you get with yelp check-in was not good, but hey, it was free! I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."}

I came on new years Eve and it wasn't crowded, service was amazing and friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed my time.

The drink I had was to die for--I ordered the pillow talk and it came in a mason jar. I was so amused at the presentation and every little detail of their dishes. Fries came in an adorable tin pail, and the entire place looked straight out of a fairytale tavern in the woods.

Out back they have an adorable patio with lighted trees and a fireplace going. It's downright romantic if youre with a significant other. I really wish I had someone with me that night.

I'm sad that I won't be able to visit any time soon as I live in Hawaii but I hope they stay open for a long time so I can always come back :) Thanks for an amazing and chill NYE ^__^"}

Came back two weeks later to show my friends and husband (out of towners) and it was a disappointment. Kitchen was behind 25-30 minutes according to the bartender. Which is cool whatever we'll get beers. Tried ordering a Dos and they were out so we tried ordering a Tecate and the tap was frozen. So we stuck with bottles of Tecate instead. I was bummed because the food, beer and service were great a few weeks before. Kind of looked like an idiot for talking it up to everyone.

The bar and restaurant has a short menu with well crafted, thoughtful food and drinks, and a full bar. The decor is quirky and well curated, giving sense to what their drinks and food will be like. My friend and I shared the breakfast burrito and french toast and they were both phenomenal, and the other 4 people in our party were pleased as well. Park on Fremont reminds me of some spots in Oakland, where casual dining and drinks are more than just 4 walls and menu, but an experience and place with an identity. Service was friendly and efficient, and this is now on my list of places to come to anytime I pass through LV."}

For alcohol I definitely recommend the refreshing Twisted Grapefruit (pictured) which is a drink made and served in a fresh grapefruit with a straw. The decor of the place is very hipster. And in true hipster spirit, they have a bike rack. Caution, the bike rack is more trendy than practical. I should have taken a picture of it, it's basically a ring in the ground, so if you don't have a long cable to loop through your bike you'll have a hard time locking it all down. Fun place though, I frequent it often."}

After some yelp searching I settled on park on Fremont.  We arrived to find a very eclectic place with lots of interesting decor. You'll see a fair amount of taxidermy and paintings that look like oddities. The floor is a herringbone wood floor that looks amazing and old possibly reclaimed, I'm not sure.  It was open seating so we picked a booth and were met with a very friendly upbeat enthusiastic waitress.  It was very evident she loves her job.  We ordered drinks and ordered cold brew coffee and were told it's bottled but good. We agree it's good but a suggestion would be to make your own cold brew coffee, that would have been perfect! Food wise we got the Avocado toast and French toast.   The Avocado toast was on point and couldn't get any better however it was outshined by the French toast.  Seriously just get the French toast and thank me later.  It's sweet with strawberry and powdered sugar. It came with maple syrup but guess what? We didn't touch the syrup is that good. Visiting from Portland, OR I can say this place would be a hit here and I recommend this place to anyone who visits Vegas."}

Park is located in the east side of Fremont. They have delicious cocktails and snacks, since I am a vegetarian I never had a full meal there, but their garbage fries and fried mac&cheese are pretty delicious.

I've had all kinds of cocktails there and my favorites are the peach sangria and the unicorn. 

What I love the most about Park is the decor. I am not a fan of taxidermy, but if you are going to do it, I guess making the animals have sexual positions is the way to do it. 

If the day is nice, I recommend sitting in their whimsical patio and if you are just slightly drunk, try the see-saw (only for the slightly drunk)."}

It might be its size - small and quaint, which gives off a very "homey" feeling. I can't forget the fact that it resembles a home with its white picket fence in front. It could be their delicious foods and drinks menu because what else would attract you to a place? Or maybe the weird, creep Disney-like decor! Perhaps its all the above combined!

This restaurant is located right down Fremont St, across from The Griffin and on the same side where Vanguard is. It can get pretty loud depending on the time you go, so if you're planning on going with friends to have some good conversation - I suggest you go on a weekday. Unless you want to be stared down by strangers and have to yell over the table, then by all means.. Come here on a weekend night.

They have a small menu, but it works! We went here with some friends so we were recommended items prior to even coming here. We started off their Chicken Wings (1 lb) and asked for the sauce on the size. These were delicious, but then again.. I've never came across a bad serving of Chicken Wings. Our main course consisted of sharing a Philly Mac and Cheese Steak (it is definitely share-worthy) alongside Garbage Fries. The meal was more than satisfying, but can I just rave for a second on their Garbage Fries?! I know it doesn't sound appealing, but their Garbage Fries consist of everything GARBA-licious smacked right on top of fries. I mean... cheddar and provolone cheese, bacon, jalapeños, green onions, tomatoes, peppers, avocados, and an egg! I probably will never not order their Garbage Fries when coming here. I feel like it would be a disservice to all things related to fries and I would be dishonoring a Fry God (if there is one). We complimented our food with 2 rounds of beer.

All in all, I left part of my stomach here at The Park... Meaning I will be back!"}

I was shocked when the bartender told me they had Johnny Blue for only $21 a shot. I dont normally drink scotch at brunch but that was too good to pass up. 
Once seated there was massive confusion to who was taking our table, server wise. About 20 minutes into us sitting with no service we had to ask the hostess what was going on. A girl finally came over but then disappeared again before we could order. Then another girl took over and she was awesome. I wish I could remember names but... i was drinking scotch at 11am lol
Andy and I shared a few different items. We had the Garbage fries (OMG) Morning Skillet, and the Chilaqules. All delicious. Our friends all had the chicken and waffle sandwiches. Those came with sweet potato tater tots. The tots were the best thing on the table besides the garbage fries
This is an amazing place to come when youve had a little too much to drink the night before. Amazing hangover/drunk food.

I love the Monte Cristo on the brunch menu, even though it really is just a ham and cheese french toast sandwich sprinkled in powdered sugar.  That will be pretty good no matter what, especially topped with a little maple syrup!  

Definitely a cool bar and restaurant in a hip part of downtown!  I enjoy the nights when they have free live music as well.  Really cool vibe..my suggestion is bring the service level and attitude up a bit and this place would be unbeatable!"}

They were right. The playful and eclectic decor provides a fun environment in which to enjoy some slightly upscale and/or creative bar food. The happy hour deals are great. Many of the appetizers are $5 during happy hour and are still full portions and many of the draft beers are $5 as well which includes a very decent selection of quality craft brews. 

We tried:

Fried Pickles - Very good, crispy, well-seasoned and served with a very flavorful sauce for dipping. 

Garbage Fries - I'm not usually a fan of smothered fries. I like my fries crispy and salty, that's it. But these were great. They still managed to maintain their crispiness and the cheese and toppings were actually very flavorful and delicious. 

Mac and Cheese Balls - Our server said this was her favorite but we weren't bowled over by it. Ultimately we just thought they were bland. 

Chicken Bar Bites - Basically boneless wings served with 3 sauces and french fries. Not bad, but not great. Their fries are excellent though. 

We had one slightly odd complaint. The restaurant smelled like fish, and not in a good way. My wife and I could both smell it, and I have a pretty lousy sense of smell. We asked the person at the table next to us and they could smell it too. Our sever suggested that it may be the sewer lines on Fremont (the entire front of the restaurant is open to the outside) but we didn't smell anything outside, just inside. We will definitely give this place another try (there are other items on the menu that I want to try out) and when we do, if the smell is gone I will update my review to remove any mention of it."}

We happen to be in here during Happy Hour, which runs from 4-7pm every day. They offer $4 well drinks and a bunch of discounted appetizers. 

We ordered their chicken wings, tater tots, fried pickles, and steak tacos. The steak tacos were ok but the fried pickles and tater tots were awesome. Food was hot and freshly cooked, flavorful, and filling. We also had drinks that were tasty.

Of course, hanging out on a patio is done best with a cold, adult beverage, so also go here to drink. 

I have been here twice, and the reason for my second visit honestly wasn't because I just had to have some fabulous dish again, it was because my pals that live downtown were hanging out on the patio, and I was jealous. I knew I was probably going to miss something (like Tony Hsieh delivering happiness in person or a Jesus Jam Band on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd) if I didn't go. So, I went, and therefore, did not miss either of those things, both of which actually happened. 

The patio offering at Park On Fremont is without doubt in a class of luxury. You can sit out front and watch Fremont Street in all its glory, or you can head out back and go for the Secret Garden experience. Both options have their time and their place. Try both. 

As for the drink offerings, I am excited to see they offer variations of the Bloody Mary! Granted, I haven't tried them, but I think it's an art form we don't have enough of in Vegas. They also have a nice beer list, but mostly in cans/bottles, and on my first visit, they didn't have 30% of the list. I think it was because they were still in soft opening mode, so I won't hold it against them. 

As for the food, it is a bit underwhelming. Portion sizes are small, and although the menu is a list of delicious potential, dishes are just a little bit less than you hoped for in size and presentation. Everything I have tried tastes good, and I do appreciate that they have a variety of options, including vegetarian, and just the fact that they have food!

So, I don't think I would go here with a starved foodie (at least not yet), but for a night downtown, it's definitely the happening spot to get your drink and patio on."}

Typically, after being greeted and seated by the host/ hostess we wait an average of 5-7 minutes for our drink order to be taken. They have a good variety of craft beer (our drink of choice) either on draft or bottled.

Our go to order is usually the chicken bar bites with their assorted dipping sauces and a side of the sweet potato tots (highly recommend the honey mustard sauce -- this from someone who doesn't really like honey mustard :)  as well as a Build Your Own Burger, or BYOB for short, with a side salad. 

Our only complaints would be  1) after ordering a burger cooked to medium and receiving it well done can be disappointing and 2) the wait time to actually GET your drinks after ordering can be a little lengthy.

Overall good food, great atmosphere (though if you don't want to be bothered by the transients walking by, do not sit along the fence outside!!) and friendly people. Very highly recommended!!"}

I was very disappointed with my experience. The bar tenders were extremely rude and seemed inconvenienced to be making us drinks. I don't really understand why because we had a large group who were all gracious tippers and not to mention friendly people! I had been sitting by the bar and overheard multiple bartenders talk badly about my group not knowing that I was also apart of that group. Complaining that there were too many of us and we were "too loud." I was unaware that we were supposed to be whispering at this bar. There was also an instance when we were trying to take a group picture in front of the bar's sign which we were to later post (advertisement) and a female bartender made a snappy comment that she needed to get through our picture so that she could work to a couple of our group members while we were in the midst of taking the picture. 

Overall, I was extremely uncomfortable here and do not plan on coming back. If you are planning on doing anything group wise this place would not be the bar for you. They prefer their bar not to be crowded and make sure you use your inside voice."}

We came for breakfast and we were not disappointed.  We came at opening so parking was not a problem and we were seated immediately.  I had my 1 year old grandson with and it was very comfortable for him too.

Our server suggested we get a starter... I have to be honest, I have never ordered a starter for breakfast.  He urgently suggested we try the fried deviled eggs.  So we complied and ordered them.  I will be dreaming of these eggs for a very long time.  They were delicious.  The whites are breaded and fried, and yet they were light and not at all oily.  Then the fried whites are piped with creamy, flavorful egg yolks, topped with bacon, sriracha and ketchup.  The combination of hot/cold/crunchy/creamy/spicy is FABULOUS.  All I know is this is a must have next time we go (and THERE will be a next time). https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=ovBp2Y8KJ3B-RAy3RqHMbg

For my main, I ordered the huevos motulenos.  I can't even begin to describe this dish.  The description on the menu didn't make much sense, I just trusted and jumped in.  It was superb.  My eggs were done perfectly, the flavors blended in a way that I never imagined.  I do not like peas, but the notation on the bottom of the menu told me that NO changes to the dishes will be made and after eating this dish I understand why.  Unless you have a life threatening allergy, trust in this chef and just order the dish that appeals to you.  She has put together flavors and textures that we would not normally think of, but they work perfectly.  This dish was a perfect example of this.  I especially loved the banana sauce on one of the eggs.  The chive potatoes were delicious as well. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=gpqlDvGzaN4aZvLybvpk8A

My daughter ordered the chicken fried steak and was not disappointed.  The breading to steak ration was very good and the gravy on top wonderful.  She ate the whole thing and it is not a small plate.  I never finished mine, but it was not for lack of trying to.  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DAt-XT-3YHrndxuxn-9LZw  The one item that comes with the chicken fried steak is toast, you choose what kind.  She chose the sourdough and it turned out to be a star all on its own.  LARGE slices of fluffy, airy delicious bread.  We both decided it was something that would have to be ordered again, regardless of which meal we chose.  I would love to see this as French Toast (hint hint)  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=xLwaGNgrMlV_a4DoltfTgA


The location is not what you expect from Vegas, although I see the eateries popping up in this neighborhood and I think we are seeing the beginning of a wonderful future.  The staff is friendly and helpful, they are also very playful, so come ready to have a fun time.  The ambiance is very new, different.  Very comfortable.  Loved the decor and they even have a patio area."}

The tea was delicious and super refreshing. The tamales were out of this world good, I definitely recommend!!! The haus salad was awful, I ended up having to toss it out.

We walked in and were told the wait was 10-15 minutes for a party of 5. 35 minutes later, we were still waiting. In that time, they seated 7 parties of 2 and 3 that came in after us. They kept assuring us that they simply needed a table large enough for us (and they couldn't possibly put two smaller tables together, for unknown reasons).

After waiting for 45 minutes for a table, two tables opened up at the same time. One was a 6 top, one was a 4 top. They tried to seat the 5 of us at the 4 top. (Side note, their 4 tops are NOT large by any means). Now, at least 2 of the other parties that came in AFTER us and were seated BEFORE us were seated at other 4 tops. 

At this point we politely said no, we wanted the 6 top so we could sit comfortably. They went the consult the owner (I'm assuming she was the owner, she was a female with short curly hair who wasn't wearing the standard black uniform). The owner then rolled her eyes and, said, "Yeah, well I want a million dollars." She didn't realize our party was standing directly behind her and to the left, so we were able to hear the conversation very clearly.

Isn't that lovely? After making us wait 45 minutes, we are being unreasonable by asking for a table that will actually seat all of us, when there is one available right there. They did eventually, reluctantly, seat us at the 6 top.

Pity, several members of our party were actually big fans of this place, but you can't come back from such terrible customer service. The biggest problem, honestly, was the fact that they tried to seat us at the 4 top after a 45 minute wait with an open 6 top right next to us. Several of our party has worked in food service and we understand waits taking longer sometimes due to parties sitting around chatting. But treating us like we're being demanding for wanting space to sit AFTER such a wait is unacceptable. The owner's comment was the final nail in the coffin to assure we never return. Clearly this place has no appreciation for it's customers."}

Appetizers that I ordered- cauliflower wings, dumplings and tuna. 

Everything tasted amazing I have no complaints.

For dinner I had the spaghetti pasta the meatballs were well seasoned and the noodles were great. 

I don't recommend the burger my boyfriend ordered it and it tasted like dirt."}

Came here based on Yelp reviews for brunch with my boyfriend on a Saturday late morning; we were purposefully looking for spots that were NOT on the Strip so we chose this non touristy place in the downtown area.

Venue / Service: slightly on the dark side when we came in, with grey wood and wrought iron decor.  Luckily we had a bit of sunlight by sitting near the window.  Vibe of a down to earth, homey brunch spot and thank goodness it was a much quieter affair than you would find on the Las Vegas Strip.  Servers were in general very friendly, always checking on the waters and trying to reassure us that our food was coming out.  

Food: I prefer lighter affairs so perhaps I'm biased against most brunch spots.  Even so, I felt like everything here tended to be a bit on the heavier side, but perhaps we ordered the wrong items.

-- Eggs benedict (spinach, tomato, bacon, chive potatoes)($13) - well balanced dish; this was the favorite between the two dishes.  Eggs were perfectly cooked and yolky.  What saved this dish was 1) the acidity from the grilled tomatoes and 2) the kick you got from the hollandaise sauce.  I usually hate things that have heat to it, but you needed the spiciness a bit to lighten up the dish (especially since there was a huge dollop of the sauce over the eggs; would have preferred less of that).  Potatoes were... potatoes... I didn't need them.  

-- Truffled egg sandwich (scrambled eggs, mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon on ciabatta with chive potatoes)($12) - recommended by the waiter but unfortunately we were disappointed.  Mushrooms and chives were great in terms of adding earthy flavors, but the eggs were slightly overcooked and overall, the dish felt really heavy.  There was too little feta to help with that and also a lot of bread.  We both kept wishing it had some sort of acidity / more herbs in it to brighten up the dish; my date struggled to finish it without feeling heavy in the stomach.

Overall, probably not the best brunch we had.  However, if you are looking for a nice, quieter spot in DT Las Vegas, this can be a spot to consider (just perhaps don't go for that sandwich)."}

I've been there at least 30 times and counting . If I'm going to have eggs Apple smoked bacon and  delicious thick toast EAT is a much better choice than Denny's or IHOP. I love the free range chicken sandwich and the Caesar chicken salad. the deep fried panko crusted deviled eggs with Apple smoked bacon and a touch of sriracha are to die for. it's an orgy in your mouth with a happy ending and well worth the money. Corned beef hash and eggs it's delicious, pancakes delicious, truffle egg sandwich delicious even the grilled cheese with basil tomato soup is delicious . So far everything I have eaten there has been delicious. 

Natalie the chef and owner has brought a great burst of sunshine to the downtown area with her fresh twists on traditional American breakfast and lunch. I hear she's going to open a fried chicken spot can't wait to taste that.

If you're going to go try to go early it gets kinda busy around lunch time. A nice touch is they have some counter seating for single person or a cool community table if you like conversation. weekends are really busy so I usually go on the weekdays. The staff is pretty awesome and all very friendly. The line chef runs a very well oiled machine of a kitchen. 

I never really have too much trouble finding a parking spot there's a lot of meters in the area. If you're in the downtown area I recommend making EAT a ATE."}

Staff are always attentive, smiling and make you feel warm and fuzzy welcome. This is definitely a "gateway vegan food" place. I'm the only vegan in my family, but they all love coming here with me. Sometimes I hear them say "Hey, what's the popup item today at Vegenation?"

You HAVE TO try Save The Tuna sushi, Sweet Potato Quesadilla, Downtown Tony sliders, Food Not Bombs Bowl and when available Chick'n and Waffles. Sure taste buds pleasers for anyone! As far as dessert, Brownie Sundae is the winner for me as it comes with delicious vegan ice cream. Hubby loves the bread pudding. He also loves their coffee and the iced tea. Their lemonade is the best lemonade in the world! With coconut water and chia seeds. 

They often have live music and little events going on. What is important to note is that the restaurant is involved in wonderful local groups that promote awesome things like gardening classes in local schools. 

What's not to love about this place!? Seriously!

P.S. Do your birthday or an event here and order a cake. You will not be disappointed! My friends still talk about the delicious cake I had for my birthday! 

P.P.S. The place is very breastfeeding friendly, so bring the little ones. ;)"}

All the food is on the menu like you'd find at another restaurant, but with more plant based options of course.

And for the gluten free, many menu items are also labeled as GF! Happy day for everyone with dietary restrictions. They nicely label all the meals with gluten and nut ingredients. 

The food is amazing. I talked about it for a few days afterwards. I ordered the eggplant stacks because I love me some eggplant and cheese. I have never had vegan cheese and this dish tasted out of this world! The portion looked rather small to me but it was surprisingly filling. It was packed with flavor. My friend ordered a salad and it was perfectly sized and no complaints in the taste. 

The restaurant is full of plants and art! The staff were all very friendly and attentive, even helping me to find a drink that would be okay for me. I really appreciated that. There isn't a lot of seating, but we had no problem finding a spot at the usual dinner time rush. Most tables are smaller with a large one for groups.

The location is great! It's across the street from The Container Park which has a parking lot right behind so it's very easy to find parking & walk around the corner to the place. The place itself is TINY! 

We walked in with a total of 4 people & we could barely fit from the space given starting from the "hostess" desk & the door. We waited about 2-3 minutes to even get noticed by staff yet there was plenty of staff walking around us and not even making eye contact. Thankfully our seat was good, we got a window seat towards the back with a beautiful green floral back drop. Great for pics!

Our server was decent, she seemed to be in such a hurry which was so uncomfortable because she made us feel rushed yet when we needed her after we put in our order, she was nowhere to be found so we had to wait until our food arrived to let them know we needed our server since we wanted our free "check in" Sangria, which was horrible. They must of used the cheapest alcohol because it was gross and tasted like nothing but alcohol. 

Our food looked great but lacked flavor. I ordered the East West Tacos. Do not order them! They are extremely sweet, so sweet that I could not even finish one taco. I only ate the tops which were fresh coleslaw and guacamole. The jackfruit was drenched in bbq sauce and it was not a good mix. The tortilla did not taste good and seemed cold, like they didn't heat up the tortilla all the way. My sister ordered their Picante Pineapple Pizza, she said she liked it but the from what I tasted, the flavors were okay but didn't come together well. My mom ordered the Vegenation Burger and said it was good, my daughter ordered the kids Spaghetti & Meatballs and the pasta and sauce was good but the meat balls weren't that good. 

What was good was their Coconut Chia Seed Lemonade & the Hibiscus Water.

Overall, customer service, the price you pay for the food & having to pay for parking, not even worth it for me."}

I've read several reviews that said the pictures of the food look amazing, but the taste itself is mediocre. We came on a Friday afternoon for brunch. The breakfast menu is stopped after 11am. There was a short wait, but they sat us pretty fast. There is only street parking available. The service was not great. Our server came up to our table to take our order but he wasn't even looking at us while we were ordering. He called out a friends name in the middle of my order and continued to not make eye contact with our table while scribbling on his pad. 

My table ordered the fried deviled eggs (only thing I would recommend), shrimp & grits, corn hash, grilled cheese & tomato soup, and the truffle egg sandwich. 

Shrimp & grits: coming from the south, I've had my share of shrimp and grits and this one was just horrible. The grits had no seasoning what so ever and the sauce that came on top has no flavor at all. I don't eat my food salty and I actually enjoy grits just plain, but this dish was just horrible. I was tempted to send it back to the kitchen, but since we were there with guest I just poured hot sauce on it... 

Grilled cheese and tomato soup: gigantic piece of toast with some cheese on it and watered down tomato soup. Pass. 

I can't rate the other dishes. I love variety so I always taste the other dishes at the table, but I wasn't even tempted to get a taste of anyone else's dish. 

Verdict: don't be fooled by the thousands of reviews and check-ins."}

I just saw Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos speak at a technology conference. And he talked about another of his ventures called Downtown Project, which is investing in revitalizing part of downtown Las Vegas. To that end, the Downtown Project offers loans to people wanting to start interesting and exciting businesses I the area. He told us that he met Natalie Young, a cook at a casino, and learned about her and her dream to start her own restaurant. So he invested in Natalie's vision, and "eat" was the result. It proved to be so successful that Natalie paid back her loan within a year due to the wild success of eat (she's now starting another restaurant, called "chow").

American Express learned about Natalie and did a commercial about her:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0GhkPEL8S_I

I've never eaten there, but will the next time I'm back in Vegas. This story alone should encourage more of you to try her restaurant. And thank Tony for making an incredible investment."}

I saw the new menu and was salivating over a shrimp po boy so I went.  I must say this was my most disappointing visit yet.  Where to begin. 1) The caesar salad was overly fishy tasting and my wife coouldn't even finish it.  2) The Shrimp Po Boy was extremely messy and difficult to eat without everything spilling off the ciabatta.  The shrimp were overcooked and tough. 3) The beignette's were more like grease balls.

I still like this place but I think I am going to stick to breakfast which seems to be much more consistent and worthy of top marks."}

I love discovering wonderful new places off strip, and eat. was definitely a wonderful new discovery! It came recommended by my roommate as somewhere to try for brunch, so we made it a point to go as our last meal of the trip. The place was definitely busy, and for a group of 4 on a Sunday around noon, it was a good 15-20 minute wait at least? The food was worth it though. The portions are generous and the price is inexpensive! I got the grilled cheese and asked them to shove a side of bacon into it, and they were more than happy to accommodate me! Think 2 huge french toast slides grilled to crispy golden perfection, but still incredibly soft on the inside, with a big pile of crispy bacon with yummy cheddar cheese in the middle! The thing was huge, I only needed half of the sandwich to fill up! It came with a yummy tomato salad on the side, and if you know me, tomatoes, bacon and grilled cheese is possibly the best combination ever. I also tried their pancakes, and for $9 you get 3 huge fluffy pancakes that are serious some of the fluffiest melt in your mouth pancakes I've tasted! Definitely worth the price!

Homemade biscuits dusted with cinnamon and sugar and crisped up on the griddle with strawberry/ blueberry compote. It tasted so farm fresh and sweet. The biscuit was soft but the outside was crispy which held up to the compote. Then I got the oatmeal with candied pecans. It was warming from inside out.

And she didn't tell me when I ordered that there were no refills. Had to keep asking server for straws. (She brought me water after I found out no more lemonade)
Also ordered to eat ...the pancakes with the sausage on top and the deep-fried deviled eggs. The deep-fried deviled eggs were insanely delicious. :) Loved the kick of flavor and loved the concept of deep fry and deviled eggs. I wished there was more than four eggs. I wanted to eat a whole dozen eggs like that. LOL. The pancakes were dry and tasted like baking soda. We asked for more syrup which was a little jars and were not told that they were $1 each. The whole experience was good. Just put some sugar in the pancake mix and don't charge for extra syrup."}

This is probably one of the better vegetarian restaurants I've been to. They're located a block outside the downtown container park. The menu has plant based takes on classic dishes such as pho, chicken & waffles, pizza, and buffalo wings. Their ingredients are local from gardens and schools they sponsor, as well as their own garden. 

We grabbed a second lunch here and ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings and save the tuna. We enjoyed both dishes and especially my husband, who usually yelps vegetarian places just for me. The choice of cauliflower was perfect for "wings" as it's "meaty". The buffalo sauce had a nice kick. The save the tuna tasted like actually sushi! My husband surely couldn't tell the difference. 

Check in with Yelp for a free spiked apple cider. This is Las Vegas after all. The alcohol content wasn't strong but perfect for me. I wish there was VegeNation back home in DC as they have some unique takes for a vegetarian place."}

During my experience there, the service was not the best. The waiters/ waitresses seemed inexperienced and were not communicating well with us. When we came in to get seated, the hostess led us half way and we were confused on which table to sit at until I asked her and she was like, "Oh, yeah. This is your table." Then the waiter came  and I asked for water and he just put up 2 fingers instead of asking if I wanted two waters for my mom. Throughout our meal, he had the attitude of "I'm so done with working." Later he went to the other waiters to talk and mingle and completely forgot about us but one of the younger waiters came to us and got us our check and to go boxes (only nice thing about our experienced).

Naturally, I had to redeem myself.  I just got back from a long drive to Amargosa Valley, so you can bet I was ready to EAT!

I had no idea that this place was purely a breakfast and lunch joint, tucked away in old downtown Las Vegas.  You can find Eat on the first floor of a small apartment complex where the area has been sprawling into an art district.  I only could find street meter parking, so if anyone else knows of any other parking options, do tell.

As I walked in, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I heard of this place from Anne, who is an amazing foodie expert that is not on Yelp and I been trying to proselytize her since.  The last thing I remember her saying is that they had an enjoyable experience except for the fact that the owner gave everyone a hard time about splitting costs between multiple debit/credit cards.  Other than that, she rated the experience a 3/4.  I was expecting more of a southern fusion breakfast lunch place.  Boy was I surprised to learn that this place is a trendy and modern eatery.

I was solo dolo so was seated at the counter.  Staff was friendly, but I already had my guard up waiting for the owner, whom I never ran into at all.  I still won't judge character based on anything but my own assessment, so was eager to meet her.  Maybe next time.

At the counter, I asked the nice girl across the counter what was good and she recommended the range free chicken sandwich topped with arugula, tomoatos, basil mayo and paired with a dill pickle and potato salad.  The Potato salad was one of the better ones I tried that ain't homemade.  The sandwich was delicious, but a bit drippy.  Still very tasty and I am a huge fan of arugula so you already know.  It was hot off the press and went well with my fresh (bottled) ginger ale by Bruce Cost.  A hint of spicy notes got my tongue's attention, but $4 is much for an 11.5 oz. beverage.

I love the decor which provided a hip yet serious look reminiscent of bustling citified diners in larger metropolitan areas like Seatown, Frisco, LA, Diego, etc.  Something I find foreign in LV and glad to see it finally arrived.

I can't wait to try other menu items and anticipating the next time I can share the experience with friends and fam.  I recommend y'all check this out if you are visiting or just hungry...a great representative of the LV foodie scene!"}

Last night I craved for Vietnamese food, I searched Yelp and trusted Yelp in my search. I wound up with mediocrity. 

This morning I decided to key in "Best Restaurant In Vegas". A restaurant named simply "Eat" ranked first. I viewed the website and saw photos of choices that worth salivating over. But the pictures on the interior settings remind me of neighborhood cafe. Right away I thought to myself, "here we go again!" But I took my chances anyway. 

Wife asked where I was taking her. I said "I'm taking you to a place that showed up first on my search on Google. 

So we drove to a neighborhood in North Vegas. When I arrived and surveyed the neighborhood, my wife joked, "wonder if someone might just open the front door and pull you in and rob you!" Yes it is that kind of neighborhood. 

Boy was I wrong about this place. When I got there, there's already a line.  Waited 25 minutes. But well worth it. BEST CAFE FOOD EVER FOR ME in Vegas. I can't say enough about this place. 

Lisa if you are still here in Vegas. Best $30 meal for 2 I ever had.  Please go to EAT for brunch. You will thank me for it."}

Vegenation is the vegan joint sponsored by Uncle Tony in the Fremont East corridor. 

The place is charming and full of bright colors and is casual, making you feel hip for eating/venturing to a vegan joint. No animals were harmed for your meal. Unfortunately, your taste buds would be.

Appetizer: Tamales and the Vegan sushi.
Tamales were mostly cornhusk with a small amount of filling. The filling was delicious, just not plentiful. Sushi was flavorful and colorful. This dish was pretty to look at and hit on all the sushi accent flavors. Awesome original flavors encountered; I was thinking "we're in for a treat," but mostly everything fell flat after this round.

Round 2: Mushroom Pizza and butternut squash ravioli. The mushroom madness pizza tasted like a Diaya frozen pizza. I've had much, much better vegan pizza in downtown (Pop Up Pizza) and it's nicer on the wallet. The squash ravioli. What the fuck was that? Sauce was runny and flavorless. And the server recommend this! 

Anyway, being a complete fatty on my cheat day, we ordered and split a blueberry cheesecake. This was pretty tasty. Not the greatest I've had, but it was pleasant and fresh and unique.

Vegenation is a place I really, really want to like. I will be back, as some items looked and smelled heavenly. I also wish they didn't have so many pasta and bread options. Processed foods are still processed foods, even if they are being served up in a cutely decorated joint in the burgeoning hipster Mecca that is Downtown Las Vegas."}

DEFINITELY a good decision on our part! Wait time was about 25 mins, which made sense, since we came in right before noon. After we got seated, the server took our order right away, so service is on point and on the urgent side.

Again with the hippy movement. When did Nevada become crunchy granola? I mean, I am sure it took place without anyone asking my opinion and that's fine, I get it. Hippy is cool in a not so cool kinda way. It's like hipsters and their man buns. It's not cool, from the perspective of grown up male adults. But, maybe they place their hair in the bun because that one drunk chick at the club who was kinda sorta cute said "oh. M. gee!" 

Like this:

My folks are a product of the 50's and were knee deep in the REAL hippy movement out here in SF. If you told my Dad that the hippy culture was cool and that people selectively chose to become hippies and refused to wash their hair n clothes n stuff and they were attempting to recreate 1960's Berkeley, he'd respond with a simple, monotone voice of "Why would anyone want to do that?"

That out of the way, the crunchiness at this spot is not for me. I live in an area of the country where the crunch in crunchy was created and I shop at Berkeley Bowl every now and then, so there!!!

Coffee was really good and really fresh. Locally roasted and I am a huge fan of local coffee. On account of the evil mermaid movement and all. 

Food was ok. Not amazing not send it back terrible just flat out ok. 

Truffled egg sandwich had a few bites of delicious and a few more bites of bland. It was odd cause with each delicious bite, I expected the next bite to follow suit. Inconsistent cooking on that order I guess. 

Pancakes were dark, in a good way and pretty solid. They serve a tiny jar of fresh maple syrup with it. Nice touch. 

Expensive, as expected in Vegas but we just ate at Mon Ami Gabi the day before and we chowed there. Chowed as in ordered enough food for 3, but it was just the two of us. This spot shouldn't be in the same price range as that spot, but it is and I'm not intrigued nor interested in that.

As plenty of women have expressed over the years, it's not you, it's me. So I'll end my review with that and allow you to crunchy it up out in the desert if you so desire."}

Our group was able to accommodate ourselves together at a larger community table after other customers left. They still wanted to charge us for a group gratuity and did nothing to make us feel welcomed or comfortable. We spoke to the manager upon request and she was not professional in any way. She did not seem concerned about pleasing her customers and tried to validate their faults with us choosing no gratuity versus getting appetizers and drinks on the house and didn't not confirm which one we would get. Very disappointed on the entire vibe of the staff for such a wholistic establishment."}

Stopped into Eat after running the Bubble Run with my wife and her cousin and family. Being that this was a Saturday morning the place was already busy and the runners added even more to the crowd. We had about a half hour wait but didn't mind. 
Once all seven of us were seated our orders were taken quickly. My wife and I ordered three entrees between the two of us. What can I say, we wanted to try it all. We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Country Fried Steak, and Huevos Motulenos. Everything was extremely tasty. Eggs Benedict was good, The Chicken Fried Steak was pretty good, the highlight being the potatoes, and the Huevos Motulenos was amazing. The Chile sauce on top was excellent. It had to be homemade with that rich smokey flavor. I haven't had peas and bananas go so good together since I was weened off of Gerber. Just a really great combo of sweet, savory, and spicy mixed in with egg yolk. Yum!
One star deduction because our server was slightly less than pleasant, perhaps from the business, but that shouldn't be a factor especially when business equates to more tips. Anyway, good fun meal. I wish nothing but future success to Natalie Young and crew."}

In the blink of an eye - server was back with our lunch! YAY for fast service on the lunch hour! 

The DWBLTA was the best I've had. Fresh absolutely everything, with lots of avocado (not one skinny slice like some places!), a schmear of - I think Russian Dressing? And the bacon was amazing. YUM. I had the chips as the side, and they were awesome! I never clean my plate, and I cleaned my plate. My friend was amazed.

Friend was sure they were gonna mess up his breakfast sandwich with his "hold this and that" business - they did not. It was perfect, and he said delicious.

A few weeks ago, my husband was downtown on business and called me up asking for a recommendation for lunch. I told him to try Eat. Afterward, he told me about the awesome blta w/ egg sandwich he had. He took me to check it out the day of the Santa Run, but the santas kept us from getting to Carson and 7th so I'd have to wait to try Eat. Then, last week; success! 

If driving be prepared to feed the parking meter. The restaurant sits on the lower level of Park Avenue Apartments. This tired building is sure to experience a revitalization thanks to the Downtown Project. Carson Ave has become a hot spot for downtown dining and it began with Natalie Young's Eat. She was the first to partner with Tony Hsieh and see her dream to fruition. She is currently working on her next venture, Chow. 

Eat bustled on a late Saturday morning, while there was no line out the door. There was a wait for a table, but counter seating was available. We settled in and gazed over the menu. Our server asked, "Can I get cinnamon biscuits started for you?" Many might be duped by the question thinking they are complimentary, only to be surprised later by an $8 charge on the bill. It is a bit sneaky so be warned. Yet, we said, "yes, bring them on!" The tender biscuits swim in strawberry compote and are topped with berries. It reminds me very much of strawberry shortcake, add some fresh whipped cream and it'd be the perfect dessert. 

When it came to ordering we skipped right over the breakfast items and went straight for the sandwiches. I had to try the dwblta ($11) myself and the husband went for the killer grilled cheese with tomato soup ($9). During the week more sandwiches are available, they all sound fantastic. However, if I ever get a chance to dine on a weekday, the chilaquiles will be mine! 

I added cheese to my dwblta, I skipped the egg; I don't dig runny eggs, blasphemy, I know. This sandwich was great! All components married beautifully and the sourdough bread held it together without being too bready. It was a thing of beauty, truly. Sandwiches come with a side of house chips, potato or tomato salad. I really enjoyed the tomato salad. Despite my best efforts I could only devour half of the sandwich. I took the rest home. This sandwich could easily be shared. 

He added tomato, egg, and avocado to the killer grilled cheese. It was a tasty twist, especially when dipped in the soup. However, as good as it was we agreed we enjoyed the dwblta a bit more. In fact, it might just be the best damn sandwich in lv."}

I stumbled across VegeNation on Yelp, and loved how their website described them as passionate about preserving the environment, and creating delicious food for health.  Their chef, who worked in well-known NY restaurants, began experiencing health problems, went vegan, and decided to create a vegan restaurant with all his healthy creations.  (Interestingly enough, this is the same story of another vegan chef, Eric Lachesseur, the classically-trained French chef who opened Seed Kitchen in Venice).  Their menu and website looked really interesting and FUN, with funny named dishes, with some of the most popular items of different cuisines- tacos, bao, quesadilla, tagine, sushi, etc.  I told my friend about this place, and she said she already knew about it and had been wanting to come here- perfect!  

The day we came, there was a chicken and waffle special!  It looked amazing and decadent, but we decided to pass on it.  The décor is casual and made pretty with plants, including a plant wall.  I ordered some coffee, even the coffee is local- the restaurant uses local ingredients as often as possible.  We started with the Bao Wow and the Save The Tuna sushi, the bao might be my favorite thing here!  I haven't had bao since going vegan, or vegetarian even, over 5 years ago.  What a treat!

For our meal, we ordered the Muchas Gracias sweet potato quesadilla, and the Ellen DeGeneres collard wraps.  The wraps were delish, but the quesadilla was the real star.  

For dessert, we had the chocolate tacos, which were inventive, but my least favorite thing here.  It was all about the presentation, with a pastry outside in a taco shape holding chocolate pudding, with berries.  I didn't think the pastry was that great, and the salted caramel was too salty for me.  I think there was a brownie sundae on the menu that I would try next time instead.

VegeNation is such a gem, and I will make this a must-stop on all my future Vegas trips.  VegeNation would really do very well in LA, I think.  It's rare when you find the combination of delicious, healthy, local food in a wide variety, with fun décor, beautiful presentation, nice people, fun environment and specials (DJ's and live music sometimes!), reasonable prices, that takes measures to protect the environment.  What's not to like?!  Only the distance from where I live ;)

Bonus: there are some great outlets 5 minutes away in a cab- vegan food + shopping is a fun, mellow Vegas day in my book!"}

Thank you, eat.!

When one is stuck in the saddest place is the world that is Las Vegas, one's skin might crawl. Mine actually itches. eat was such a pleasant respite from the strip mall hell that is most of that town, and it really brings it with the food and the atmosphere.

--Great music playing that's not too loud.

--Fantastic food with something for everyone (and generous portion sizes like the rest of this town).

--We had the truffled egg sandwich minus bacon (hey people, if one doesn't get bacon can you PLEASE add something else or take off some money?!), the arugula/asparagus salad, and a side of cheesy grits. Everything was delicious, and the home fries that come with the egg sandwich are actually REAL home fries, as in, crisped and tossed with onion. We saw a number of delicious-looking menu items gets sent out from our counter/kitchen-view seats. The housemade veggie burger looked particularly amazing too.

--Also, coffee!! The first/only decent coffee I had on the whole trip, and you can get Sugar in the Raw.

--Leftovers NOT packed in styrofoam!! Hallelujah! While the rest of Las Vegas attempts to kill the environment and the humans in it at every turn, here at eat you can get leftovers packed in paper!

We had counter seats with a view (and ear) to the kitchen. We figured out why there are so many complaints about service. It is slow and inconsistent, and frequently there were up to 8 meals ready to go out to tables, but servers weren't taking them as fast as the kitchen was working. Also, for some reason, instead of table numbers or seat numbers, one person would say "This is for the heavyset gentleman in the hat over there" rather than "This is table 11." Very odd. 

Our service was fine, and we weren't in a hurry but I hope if any owner/manager reads this you'll take the service complaints to heart. They seem valid. Also, vegetarians really hate having to ask for a left-off ingredient like bacon, prosciutto, sausage (things with an upcharge) but not getting offered something for a sub or $1 off.

If I ever have to return to the saddest place in the world I will eat here at least once."}

It was easy to find, just a few blocks from downtown. We arrived at 1pm and had about a 10 minute wait which was not bad for the time of day. 

I ordered the food I had read great reviews about starting with the beignets. They lived up to the hype! They were warm and crispy on the outside with a nice fluffy center. They were served with a raspberry sauce and a wonderful vanilla mascarpone. The mascarpone was not too sweet and tasted great with the raspberry sauce. 

I ordered the shrimp and grits while my husband ordered the black bean veggie chili. Both were superb! The shrimp and grits are served with apple-smoked bacon and two fried eggs. It is the perfect combo.

I was really expecting "not so great" service after reading reviews of EAT. Our waiter, Justin, certainly proved those reviews wrong. He was super friendly and we never felt rushed. He kept the drinks coming and sat down to chat for a couple of minutes. I will definitely go back to EAT when I am in Las Vegas again."}

The water was served promptly and the waiter was back to take my order right on time.  Service appears to be a team effort here and they are good at it.  Manager was present and actively working.  

I had a Chicken Cesar (easy on the dressing) and a side of turkey bacon.  Both were served quickly and the salad was exactly as I requested.  The chicken was fresh and flavorful, nicely sliced.  The lettuce was first-rate and crisp.  And the bacon was awesome.  This was an excellent meal.

I had coffee for dessert and again it was hot, super-good and fresh.

eat is popular for a clear reason.  Highly recommended!"}

I wanted the beignets and they were out so we had some yummy shortbread and berry dish instead....great way to start a meal though.  I really did like the concept, layout/design, and menu offerings here.  The owner takes pride in all aspects of the establishment and is very diligent about walking about and standing over operations (sometimes reminding staff about what they should be doing).   

The service was pretty good...we were well tended to and never really needed anything.  From what I gathered it seems like they are still working out an effective plan for better logistical coordination of guests when it gets crowded; but that did not affect us as we arrived right before the lunch crowd.

The food was delicious - it is not your typical breakfast and lunch fare - this place offers you up gourmet offerings in unique and creative ways which will have you wishing you were more hungry; so you could try out more than just one entrée.  Believe me; you need to be famished when you go because you will not want to stop eating.  Hence the title - eat.

I really enjoyed it and when back in Vegas; will most definitely try to get back over to this part of town for such great food."}

They had many gluten free options as well, giving me a variety of choices, yay! 

We started with the two for one drinks, both were tasty but oddly they're normally $6 and two for one is $9. I feel like I'm good at math, but given the prices on the strip I didn't question it. Next was the Save the Tuna appetizer. The portion was good for the $7 price. Well balanced flavor with appropriate fishy taste. Served with tamari sauce to make GF. We also had the tamale appetizer ($7). Tamales (2) were outstanding. Very well flavored, masa was not too heavy. Nice sauce and filling. I definitely recommend these.

My wife had the Stuffed French toast - she thought it was really good, filled with fresh fruit and "cream cheese". It was served with a side of fruit.

I had the Food not Bombs bowl. Very filling with potatoes, black beans and scrambled tofu. Great for a filling brunch to last to dinner.

Service was great too! Highly recommend this place!"}

There were two of us and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table, which we thought was ok. We put our names on the list and waited outside where there were some benches on the sidewalk. While waiting we looked through the menu.

When it was time for us to be seated, the helpful greeter inside called my name loud and clear both inside (I heard it, even though we were outside) and then they came outside too! Great service for this part.

We were seated quickly and someone came to take drink orders right away. Coffee here was average, but there were other options like lemonade and many teas in the selection.

The menu is pretty standard food for a brunch spot. I ordered the corned beef hash, but it came as meat cubes, not hash. The poached eggs were average and presentation here is clearly not important. While the food tasted OK, it was not outstanding or memorable. There's no reason to wait in line for this.

Service was prompt, but I was surprised that nobody offered water for our table. Just bring water - it's the most basic thing humans need after air. Bring it, or at least offer it. 

Overall this place feels rushed and driven by turnover. It's clean and the food is OK. The servers are friendly, but they are moving fast and that is their main focus."}

This place is all smoke and mirrors.  I can't fathom anyone would give it more than one star. This was my 4th visit to the restaurant.

It's beyond bright, it's like walking out of a club at 7 am.  It's as if no one is conscientious of setting a restaurant's ambiance.  Is this a cafe or dinner place?

They had half way cleaned tables, like they halfway clean a table and then their ADD kicks in and they walk away and don't finish.  I was fighting my gut to walk out because I had a companion that wanted to try it.  It looked terrible.

The waiter leans into the table like he's tired, to get the order which I find highly inappropriate.  We ask for water and a coffee.  The waiter carries two large glasses in one hand because God forbid this place buys trays and makes the waiters use them.  Like I want this guy's hands all over my drinks.  You're in the food business.  This isn't your living room.

He brings the French press coffee pot to the table but he has yet to bring the coffee mug or cream.  Then he brings the mug. Then he asks what type of cream my friend wanted.  The coffee alone takes three trips of the waiter.  He should have asked all this before bringing the coffee. Don't bring food and drinks that I can't touch yet because you haven't also brought the items I need to enjoy them.  I wanted to try the coffee so we called a busboy over and asked him to please bring a mug which was two feet away.  This guy is such a people pleasing nervous wreck that he brings an empty teapot and a mug over and is fumbling with it trying to put it down.  He is holding the mug in his hand and making nonsense chatter that I am afraid to ask him for anything else.  We told him we didn't ask for the teapot we only needed the mug. Then he shakes his head no, like he's bowing and takes the mug with him and leaves the pot.  We have to tell him a 3rd time to leave the mug.  Then the coffee wasn't even hot.

We had the sushi, sliders, and veggie burger.

He brought the sushi first, which was my entree.  But in usual fashion of the untrained staff, he did not bring the chopsticks, so we have to wait and stare at the food.   Does the kid think that I wish to eat separately from my companion??? I told him it was my entree but he has no idea how to serve people dinner.

The the sliders came, which once were good but tonight weren't even cooked inside and they lacked enough aioli as a previous time I had them.

Then this thing came. This pink mush paste on a pita type bread.  That's a burger?????
It was God awful.  We asked what it was made of which I don't recall but it's not a burger in any way shape for form. It's pink paste. I don't think it's cooked.  I'm trying to come up with a texture that it's like but I can't think of any food like it.

Our plates were raging hot from sitting under the heat lamps but the food was cold.

The ketchup, that's another fascinating aspect....it's homemade, and allegedly has curry and other spices, but tonight it was cold tomato paste.  It doesn't have a ketchup texture.

We sent the burger back and opted for the Italian sub, which was actually good, but not good enough that I will ever go here again.

Then we have this mess on our table of empty plates and this busboy guy comes over (finally) then makes this big hand gesture asking if he can take our plates as if we would say no, we say yes, and he replies, "are you sure?"  Yes we're sure we don't want our empty dirty plates and napkins anymore!

The entire place is disturbing."}

Came in for lunch around 1:30.  Happy to see that almost every table was full.  Attentive service right away - yes please to water, its only 105+ outside :)  I knew already what I was NOT going to order - the African Yam Stew.  I am still pining away for Steph & Justin's VegOut AYS - nothing could top that dish!

I couldn't decide between the meatball sub or the quesadilla, until I saw the table next to me get the quesadilla.  It looked good so I ordered that.  Sushi came out almost immediately.  Today there was a red bell pepper strip, some avocado and what tasted like a carrot puree on top.  Really good, flavorful and tasty.  Scarfed those 6 little rolls down in a blink of an eye.  

Then the quesadilla came out.  Very pretty with the chipolte sauce drizzled on top.  My order was mostly sweet potato puree with some black beans sprinkled throughout.  So it was kinda mushy to eat.  But it had just a slight spicyness because of the chipolte sauce.  I wish there had been more sauce and black beans.  

Between those two dishes, I was too full for dessert.  Next time.  And there will be a next time.

We were staying at the D and I didn't want a breakfast buffet for the second day in a row. I saw this place was only a couple blocks away, the photos and menu looked promising so we headed over.

For a Vegas visitor, the walk down Carson at 8am can seem a little sketch but have no fear! When we walked in it was cozy and cute and trendy in a very non-intimidating way. We opted to sit at the counter since every seat was full (30 minutes after opening!) and I'm really glad we did. Our pink-haired waitress was SO friendly, helpful and overall just seemed like a super positive person, which was a great start to our day. Plus, we got to watch the action in the kitchen and the chef was really commanding her own back there. 

I had the Truffled Egg Sandwich, which was super tasty. Scrambled Eggs with sautéed mushrooms, chives, feta and kick-ass bacon on a ciabatta roll. So freaking good. It came with Chive Potatoes, which were cooked pretty perfectly. BF had the egg dish that came with beans, peas, feta and some other stuff on a corn tortilla and he loved it. The salsas that were on top were so good. 

We HAD to split a pancake because they looked amazing. It was. Perfect crispy edges with a fluffy middle. I could eat these all day.

The lunch menu looked equally awesome, but it was 8:30 am so I passed.

$4 for a cup of tea.
Is this magic tea?

I could only eat one pancake because they're dense, not fluffy.
And when they arrive, they are not hot so the butter didn't melt on them.
Also, had to ask for butter.
Do millennials not use butter on pancakes?
Then they sat like a rock in my stomach all day.

Uneventful is all I can say.
Not enough to come back.

It's about 10 minutes from the strip and parking was easy (meter parking). Also the name of the restaurant is in a cool stylized font with the whole period thing at the end of the word eat--just makes you want to eat, right?

I went with the Huevos Motulenos which I honestly didn't like--I'm not sure why so many people are nuts over this dish. I feel like the salsa just doesn't go well in a main course. It was an interesting concoction of food items I've never really had together but I wish I had gotten something else. I wanted to try the Truffled Egg Sandwich but they only serve it Monday through Friday. Their pancakes are huge.

I want to give this place 4 stars, but I can't because were somewhat duped into buying an appetizer. So, you know how lots of restaurants give you free bread before your meal? Our waitress asked us, after serving us water, "would you like some biscuits?" Well, to us this sounded like pre-meal free bread so we said yes. What she really meant to say is, "would you like to start with an appetizer called the 'cinnamon biscuits, warm strawberry compote'?" The money wasn't the issue, but the trickery into ordering more on the menu. She might as well have started by saying, "would you like to start with the Dom Perignon?"

The staff was very nice/efficient. I recommend checking this joint out if you want some breakfast off the strip. Is it worth taking a taxi here? No. I really only went because I had my car. Albeit, this is a decent breakfast eatery."}

My husband had the two eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast that were done perfectly. Holy moly the toast was huge! Chewy and fresh too. Just yum.

I had the truffled egg breakfast sandwich with potatoes-  simply AMAZING!

Coffee was hot and fresh. Waitstaff were friendly and appeared to help each other out. Like every table was "their" table also. 

It felt very comfortable in the restaurant. I could've stayed all day and sipped coffee.

The location left a little to be desired but it wasn't like we were going to camp out overnight."}

Now that downtown Vegas is hip and cool, a restaurant like this only makes sense. The flavors were surprisingly awesome for everything we had (Mexican hummus, tofu scramble, and hot tamale) except for the dumplings, which had the consistency of grainy earth. The cold brew and peanut butter cacao smoothies were also fantastic. 

We went for Sunday brunch, and they had a 2 for 1 mimosa and Bloody Mary special going all. Also a small band for some chill, live music.

As someone who is not vegan or vegetarian I still found a few breakfast items that jumped out. I ordered the blueberry waffles with a cup of Sumatran coffee. 

They bring the coffee out in a fancy press brewed to perfection, the waffles come out beautifully arranged on the plate dusted with cinnamon sugar. It accompiened with an organic blueberry sauce, maple syrup, and a bowl of fruit salad. 

All and all very tasty, the portion was however on the smaller side. The atmosphere is very green and refreshing. 

I will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner."}

The truffled egg sandwich looked like it'd be a bit heavy, but the eggs were fluffy, bacon crispy, feta creamy w/ hints of truffle oil, & the skin of chive potatoes had a bit of a crunch that gave a good textural difference and made it a really good side. The pancakes we got were a pretty decent size with some powdered sugar on it. Surprisingly the pancakes had a bit of a crisp on the top layer and were almost cloud like w/o that heavy butter taste. If you're staying Downtown or just want a change in location for brunch I'd definitely recommend this place."}

The food (Sushi, Pasta, Buns, Quesadilla, Burger, Fries, Tacos) hit the spot! They are a bit over priced for what they are- (I could make it at home). The presentation of the food is beautiful, but for "street food" I think maybe some alterations to fit that aspect could be made. 

The Dessert (Sundaes) The ice cream that they use is awesome!! So creamy and flavorful. It was a huge portion and I think fit the price! 

The Service was on point. The hostess was so humble and kind. Our waiter was good and attentive. I saw chef Donald come out to talk to some of the customers.

I was really worried the wait would be super long from the other color runners, we were told it would be half an hour, but it only ended up being 15 minutes. I already knew I wanted the chicken fried steak since it had good reviews and looked delicious from the pictures on here. I also ordered passion tea, which was okay I wish I would of ordered the strawberry drink instead. I was very pleased with the chicken fried steak, the breading was well seasoned and it was a huge piece, a sharable portion. The gravy and seasoned potatoes went with it pretty well too. I ordered the house made chips instead of eggs and I was really disappointed because they look good in the pictures but didn't have the texture I was hoping for. I also had the English muffin as my side, which was nothing spectacular. My 2 other friends both ordered the chilaquiles scrambled eggs, they were both kinda whatever about it because they didn't expect it to be vegetarian. I did I have a bite and liked it, but I always welcome vegetarian options in my diet.  The inside is awesome, hipster type of fare I must say.

I've worked in the restaurant industry and the staff here really made my dining experience exceptional. I came in with my parents and they enjoyed their meals: oatmeal and an egg dish. I had the tofu scramble and although it wasn't the best, it wasn't bad. They do need to kick that up a notch and add more vegan friendly dishes on the menu (I had to ask for the tofu scramble because it wasn't on the menu when I arrived yet it was on the menu online). The menu said it came sautéed with onions, peppers and mushrooms and I assumed it would be firm tofu scrambled but it was fried squares with little flavor and no onions or peppers (I told them to hold the mushrooms). The potatoes were delicious and so was the very thick cut toast! Yum! I will definitely be back next trip to Vegas but hope to see more vegan items on the menu."}

But I prefer to support local businesses, and I rarely want to deal with the hassles of a casino, especially at lunch, so I thought I'd give Eat a try.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's in a sketchy neighborhood, but inside it's filled to capacity with downtown hipsters. Seating was quite limited so I opted to sit at the lunch counter. Not a great choice because I spent my whole lunch impeding the flow of waitresses and listening to the expediter shout orders. I kept thinking I should lend a hand and plate some food or deep fry something.

The food itself is good. I had the roast beef sandwich, potato salad and iced tea. The quality of the ingredients was above average, and they seem to take care with presentation and little added touches. But the price was what stopped me dead in my tracks. $16.50 plus tip for a sandwich, side and a drink. Ouch! I hadn't planned on spending $20 on lunch, and if I had, I would have gone someplace better.

 I gave them a fair try, but unless I get a raise or someone else is buying, I won't be back. I'll leave the $4 cup of coffee for the hipsters."}

They were out of the corned beef hash so I got the pancakes instead with a chicken apple sausage. I'm not usually a sweet breakfast type of person ....rather savory instead. However, these pancakes were AMAZING! I hold pancakes at a high standard because of a place back home that's been around before my grandmother dined there (Liliha Bakery, Hawaii).  The three pancakes are thick and fluffy,  have a golden crust on the outside and a very soft, moistness on the inside. Big bonus: they serve them with real maple syrup.....not that imitation fake corn syrup stuff. I will be coming back for these again!"}

One of us got a dish they called Chilaquiles. Basically it was corn chips with a small amount of melted cheese, scrambled egg and a split sausage link of some kind. Ok but not really good by any means. I had the Huevos Motulenos. It is basically a tortilla with black beans, feta (which you cannot taste as it is overpowered by everything else), banana,two eggs and salsa. It was good, not great.

The bananas were the black sheep of my plate (I expected them to be fried like "platanos fritos", but you only notice they're regular bananas if you're an obnoxious Mexican customer who knows real Mexican food). I am giving a four stars, because I don't know at what point our waiter decided he hated my guts. I loved that he offered to add avocado to my dish, and I love that he gave me some sass on the side too. I'm down for that kind of attitude in a chill vibe like the one you breathe at this place. At the end however, he decided to sigh at my request to split the check. That's the kind of sass I don't need with my brunch.

This little place gets busy, but it's worth the wait. I got the chicken fried steak, delicious and well seasoned. The toast they serve is about an inch think which is great if you love bread. The server was attentive, but she did seem a little overwhelmed the day we went. I saw the owner there chatting with regulars. If downtown continues to offer up similar types of places, I may be spending more time in the area to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Keep up the good work."}

The taste of the food was very good, but the service was clearly sub-par, and the portions size/value ridiculously bad. 

Spouse had a Burger, it was delicious and reasonable for $12. 

I had the 'Power Haus" salad. It was basically an slightly oversized side salad. Delicious, but barely sized for a starter. A bowl of little but lettuce of various kinds, a few thin slices of carrot, a few other items, you get it. Should have been listed for $5, maybe $6. Was $12. I was more hungry after eating it than before. We brought up the lack of substance to an employee, and was told we should have chosen another menu item. Well, thank you for that information.

Service was seriously lacking on attention. Water was served without straws, had to flag down a waiter to get them. Nobody refilled our glasses after we emptied them 5 minutes into the meal. Nobody paid attention, nobody in sight.

Again, the food tasted real good, but there are so many options in LV to get a solid, well crafted salad with plenty of substance in the $12 - $15 range, and receiving attentive service, so I don't see why we would return. The place looked nice, but the value and the service just isn't there. Too bad."}

I had met Chef Donald at an event almost 2 years ago,  when I first learned about his all vegan restaurant he planned to open downtown.   Ever since then I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of VegeNation!  So, when Surprise! They opened almost a week earlier than they had originally stated, I needed to get my grub on ASAP.

I was there twice today, TWICE!  It is that good, it is that budget friendly, that I went for both lunch and dinner and I'm not ashamed!

Staff - perfectly nice and attentive.  I enjoy when I'm at a restaurant and I can feel that the server loves and believes in the food.  The servers aren't quite there yet,  but I take away no points because my understanding is that the servers weren't expecting the early opening either.   They were perfectly good servers,  this is just a preference of mine and I'm confident they'll get there. 

Location - in the up and coming part of DTLV, walking distance from Container Park and such, easy on-street parking.

Decor/Ambience - Check out photos attached.  Very comfortable.  

Lunch - CIAO MARGARITA PIZZA I'm not a big fan of Daiya, but the in house made sauce, charred grape tomatoes,  basil,  and perfectly cooked crust won me over.   MUCHAS GRACIAS Sweet Potato Quesadilla oh em gee, so freaking good, I can't even.  CHOCOLATE TACOS little pastry crisps filled with chocolate pudding,  topped with salted caramel,  berry, and coconut.  JAMAICAN HIBISCUS PUNCH caffeine free,  just enough sweetness, LEMONADE WITH COCONUT WATER AND CHIA SEEDS. I didn't taste this,  but it looked awesome and my friend loved it.    My omni Co worker was blown away by how good everything was.  My favorite tidbit from her was "I am so satisfied, so full, yet I don't feel gross "  Yup, welcome to Vegan food, my friend!

Dinner - MEATBALL GRINDER "meat" balls in that delicious red sauce on a toasted hoagie roll, topped with melted Daiya, served with a side of potato wedges and their own home-made ketchup.  The Hub's reaction "I didn't realize how much I missed meatball parm" (we've been vegetarian for many years) EAST WEST TACOS Jackfruit (mimics pulled pork) seasoned well,  topped with a Korean sauce and just the right amount of citrus (lime) to. Die. For.  BLACK BEAN CHILI  STUFFED SWEET POTATO this is actually a side item, and it tastes exactly as good as it sounds.   BROWNIE SUNDAE so effing good period.  DRINKS We had a drink that was Whiskey,  Cold Pressed Apple juice,  and cherry.   It was divine (and strong).  Also had the Mango Ceylon Iced Tea delish!

Price - for lunch,  before tip we were at $36 (2 meals,  2 drinks,  dessert)  for dinner,  before tip we were at $49 (2 meals,  1 alcoholic beverage,  1 non alcoholic beverage,  1 side,  dessert)  Incredible value considering our non-alcoholic drinks included free refills and the ingredients are organic whenever possible.

 Bottom line - Highly Recommended.  Check out their website for more info including their mission statement.   Veggies and Omnis alike can appreciate the flavors, artistry, and feel good vibed of VegeNation"}

My suggestion would be to punch up the flavor of the tofu banh mi.  I am always appreciative when there is a vegan option at restaurants.  I ordered the tofu banh mi veganized and it was pretty plain.  My lunch mates enjoyed their chicken sandwich, salad and grilled cheese.  It's a great restaurant with huge potential.

I was hoping for good eats, but wasn't 100% sure what to expect. What I got was a complete treat for all my senses. 

We went for Sunday brunch, and when I walked in, I did think, "Man, this place is loud," but when I saw a live DJ in the corner, I couldn't help but smile. The entire vibe makes you feel like ish is happening here every day. The interior is just perfect with concrete floors, spring-like colors and an open kitchen for you to witness the creation of your eats. We ate at the counter and loved it. 

Service was a little aloof, but I was too distracted by all the tattoos to really care. I think they just really mean business. 

The menu itself is a work of art worth reading down to every last bite. The dishes are creative and well-thought out. You know there is a real love of food just by reading the possibilities. We ordered the Huevos Motulenos, Turkey Benedict (only available during weekend brunch) and a short stack of pancakes ($5!!). The Motulenos features a mind-dizzying array of ingredients, including sauteed bananas! Mixed in with two chilis and a variety of beans, it turned out to be a delicious dish of sweet and spicy. And, the breakfast potatoes were legit. Basically, chop up a potato and make it sizzle. A true tater. The Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach was also a winning combination of flavors. I swear I tasted basil, but whatever I tasted, I approve. The only slight complaint there was that it came out lukewarm. 

Now, the pancakes deserve their own paragraph, but can be best summarized with one word: perfect! They managed to have crispy, but not burnt, edges and a soft, milky center. They were the perfect thinness, making it all too easy to devour a short stack all by your lonesome. 

Worth noting: While the weekday menu includes tofu scramble and a tofu banh mi, I didn't notice any vegan options on the brunch menu. Might be worth calling if you're a vegan headed there for a weekend brunch.  

My only other minor complaint is that I thought the coffee was a little weak. However, that in no way prevents me from respecting this culinary gem. It's just so cool, a true Vegas original."}

My son's pancakes were SLAMMIN and I had chilaquiles.  Red sauce was different, but still good.  No espresso, but had coffee instead and it was ok (not my style but the waitress said it was good and strong).  We all loved our meals.  Our meal was pricey so heads up!

Some excellent dishes.  Some mediocre dishes.  But it's a little hit or miss on the customer service.  

I love this place and I love that it's located downtown.  Finally, a great brunch and lunch spot in the 89101.  Finally, a neighborhood place not catering to Southern California tourists.  It's awesome.  It's friendly.  And it's become so well-known that it can be tough to get a seat.  

The lunch menu is solid--great sandwiches and salads. The grilled cheese is excellent with thick Texas toast style bread and sharp cheddar.  Simple and awesome.  Nice fresh tomato salad on the side.  The roast beef sandwich is also tasty.  Fresh and thin roast beef with bright blue cheese on perfect bread.

For brunch, there's a lot of excellent options and some that just miss the mark.  The eggs benedict is delicious.  The chicken fried steak was decent, but not brilliant--more of a kitschy choice but not particularly well done.  The main disappointment is 
the huevos rancheros dish.  It's an awkward attempt at culinary creativity with peas and sautéed bananas mixed into the savoriness of eggs and rancheros sauce.

This place has an excellent, inviting atmosphere. In a downtown focused on daytime business and nighttime drinking, it's a nice spot for the locals.  A spot to meet and spend time connecting with people.  And there's a charming porch to sit on when it's not baking hot outside.

If there's a main setback, it's that Eat can't handle the lunch rush that happens Mon-Fri.  There's so few great food options in downtown Vegas that Eat is crowded every day.  If you're coming for lunch, prepare to wait.  And try to keep the number of your party to 2 people.  The hostesses have a hard time figuring out how to seat parties larger than 2 in an efficient way.  Know this going in and you'll have a great time.

Bottom line: 4.5 stars for the excellent atmosphere, friendly service, and generally solid menu.  Minus one star for occasionally cranky customer service, long waits at lunch, and some mediocre dishes."}

Love the indoor garden, creates a great ambiance. Menu has a lot of variety, may be hard to choose what you want: apps, salads, pizzas, and various ethnic entrees, plus juices. 

MY LITTLE DUMPLING: steamed Shiitake and spinach dumplings. Easily some of the best dumplings I've had, stunningly good quality. They were clearly fresh and handmade, with ample filling, and a tasty dipping sauce to boot. But $6 for a portion of 5 just-bigger-than-bite-size bits was steep.
DOWNTOWN TONY: Trio of portabella sliders with kale and sriracha aioli. Pretty good execution, good choice of mini brioche buns, but the aioli was so sparingly applied it seemed to be on there for color rather than flavor. Dish is plated with some simple potato fries and a house-made ketchup. Again, good quality!

Dishes are flavorful but sophisticated, with a  price tag to match. Solo lunch above was a hair below $20 with tip. Service was polite and attentive, really love the way they've styled the space! I'll come back to try their vegan sushi and bao.

EDIT: Dropping a star. As happy as I am to have vegan options in Vegas, this place is inconsistent. Most recent visit was sorely lacking in both food quality (boring, simple dishes) and service (inattentive, lack of knowledge when we had questions about specific dishes)."}

We ordered the corn beef hash with poached eggs, shrimp and grits, one pancake, tomato soup, iced coffee, and passion fruit iced tea.

Corn beef hash and eggs - corn beef hash itself was good. Diced and goes well with the egg yolk. 

Shrimp and grits - grits had great texture. A good amount of shrimp but tasted frozen. 

Pancake - tasted like funnel cake. Not bad. 

Coffee - nothing special 

Passion Fruit Iced Tea - refreshing

Here comes the horrible service. These are facts, not opinions.

We were seated by a nice hostess and given our drinks immediately. Our server whom I will not name for his safety didn't bother to greet us or introduce himself. After we ordered and was well into our meal, not once did he come up to us to ask "how we were doing?" "How's the food?" Or refilled our water cups. However, he did all those three service favors for others around us. I politely asked for syrup from him and he gave me a blank face. Came back and put the syrup in front of me with no word. 

After we were finished with our meals and already annoyed, a busser comes to our table and asks (in a awkward tone) "are you done?". He stacked our plates quickly and never said a word further. Not to mention we thanked him for cleaning our table. 

When I asked our waiter for the check, he came back with it and didn't say a single word. I paid and left him a tip because I understand servers make their money off tips. I left him a personal note to let him know our experience at Eat.

Extremely disappointed.... Our highly anticipated lunch at Eat. during our thanksgiving weekend getaway was ruined due to the poor service."}

Entrees: I ordered the east west tacos. Jackfruit tacos with Korean chili paste sauce. Interesting fruity tasting taco. Not sure it's my cup of tea. If it had a tofu and jackfruit protein instead of bean and jackfruit will be good. 
I enjoyed the curries red beans and quinoa. They used a coconut based curry.  I do wish the quinoa was a little more less cooked so it will have a nutty texture

One ordered the mama Mia pasta. Tasty sauce the meat ball tastes really meaty.
Another person ordered the same thing but with their noodles was substituted with miracle noodle. The noodle resembles clear ramen noodles. One ordered the pizza and another the "chicken"and waffles  which is delicious. Crisp!

We have dined in vegan restaurants from Los Angeles to New York to Portland to Paris, France and hands-down this is the best vegan food we have ever had!

It seemed like the perfect time to try eat, downtown's newest chef-driven hotspot. I'm happy to say that chef Natalie Young's restaurant fully met my expectations, and the waitstaff seemed slightly more friendly than anticipated. I noticed mixed reviews of the service, but I'm guessing that Romney's loss put everyone in a good mood!

Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young was playing when we arrived, and Tony Hsieh was dining at a table in the front corner of the restaurant that I will assume is reserved for him. The soundtrack continued with the 60s/70s folk theme, which suited me just fine! Choosing between the creative egg dishes and scrambled tofu on the breakfast menu was tough, but I was most interested in the truffled egg sandwich. Served on a buttery croissant (presumably from Chocolate & Spice, like the other pastries served at eat), the sandwich featured a flavorful melted cheese, perfectly scrambled eggs, sauteed wild mushrooms, and a side of tasty breakfast potatoes. I won't be surprised when I see one of those Food Network "stars" describing this dish as The Best Thing They Ever Ate, as it is certainly worthy of the praise. My request to leave the bacon off the sandwich was granted without attitude. The wild mushroom mix likely included some pesky shiitakes, but they were tastefully prepared.

I love the feel of this restaurant and can't wait to return to sample the huevos motulenos and explore the lunch menu. My only complaint would be the difficulty of obtaining a coffee refill, but I'm not inclined to subtract a star for that."}

On a Saturday morning I get a text from my friend who says he just flew in and the people he was supposed to hang out with on the Strip are all hungover and sleeping still, so my husband and I swoop him up from his hotel and suggest eat. since we wanted to show him the downtown area. The location itself is very unique and just walking distance from Container Parker. Being from SF/Bay Area, we're all used to extremely long waits for brunches, so eat.'s 20 minute wait was no big deal. Once we finally got seated, the 3 of us ended up in a 2-top that was in a corner. It was very.. cozy, but what's a little bit of discomfort among friends? The hostess was very sweet and wanted to make sure we didn't wait too long, so I appreciated that. We ordered the corned beef, eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and pancakes for the table. The pancakes were mouth-watering, and probably the best part of the meal, but one of the servers did give me grief about asking for more syrup (I swear the dinky little serving they give isn't enough!) My friend ate all of his corned beef, so he had no complaints; however, my husband hated his chicken fried steak with a passion. It was very tough - just looking at it you could tell it was completely dry and devoid of flavor. He left a large chunk of it uneaten and didn't bother taking it home. Since we didn't have that much room on the table, I wasn't really feeling my eggs benedict, so I placed it behind me in the booth and stuck to my pancakes. As other people have experienced, waiters are somewhat hard to track down. Someone who wasn't our waiter asked me if I was done with my benedict plate and if he could take it away. It was barely touched, so I'm surprised he didn't ask what was wrong and didn't ask if I wanted to take it to go (my husband eventually ate it at home to make up for his lack of a meal). Maybe we should have ordered a few different items like the truffled egg sandwich, but my husband probably would never want to come back here. I came here wishing that we had spent our morning eating at Mr. Mama's since I haven't been there yet. Hopefully that place doesn't disappoint. Eat. does look like they have a pretty big and devoted following, so I hope they continue to do better and improve on the shortcomings guests have pointed out as of late."}

We moaned and told her that we were hoping to have breakfast.  Another person (the manager???) overhead our conversation and came over to tell us if we could order quickly that the kitchen would accomodate our order.  We asked what she would recommend; she suggested the Shrimp and Grits.  I had intended to have something really breakfast-like but since that dish was on my 'to-have' list, I thought, why not try it here.  My cousin ordered the steel cut oatmeal and the beignets.  

When the food was served, I split off some of the shrimp and grits to share.  What a mistake; I wish I could have eaten the whole order myself, after having the first bite.  I'm not sure if the restaurant's recipe was traditional, but it sure was gooooood.  Buttered grits on the base, perfectly cooked shrmp, sweet crispy bacon, sauteed pico de gallo, two eggs, and finely chopped red onion.  There was a great balance of flavors and texture.  I'm usually not good with raw onion, but these were cut very fine and were extra sweet so they added an unexpected flavor and texture.  My cousin was also happy with the oatmeal.  This review would have been a 5-star except that the beignets were pretty heavy (suspect that if we had ordered them in breakfast prime-time that they would have been lighter.  But the homemade jam that they were served with was very good so that made up alittle). 

Will definitely come back on my next visit and will recommend to my friends and family."}

There were quite a few regulars there as evident from their familiar interactions with the staff and with the friendly service I knew that if we were locals we would be regulars here too.

And of course the food was delicious! My boyfriend and I shared the shrimp and grits and the corned beef hash. Both plates were amazing in that comfort food goodness kind of way. I loved the chunky corned beef and the way the grits were seasoned was just perfect! The toasts that both plates came along with was also good and you'd want an extra helping to sop up the creamy grits. Last but not least, the coffee was really good! I thought I'd be disappointed that they didn't have an espresso machine but we liked their coffee so much that we ended up buying a bag! Turns out they use beans from Mothership Roasters, a local roasting company that sources single origin beans. Yup, exactly my kind of place. We were definitely happy to have found this place!"}

Really nice looking place - modern/industrial look.  Solid breakfast menu with American and Mexican items - everything was around the $8 - $12 range.  My brother got the chicken friend steak and I ordered the chilaquiles. The food came out quick and it was excellent.

Now, I have to start off with the fact that if you're looking for traditional chilaquiles you're going to be disappointing, luckily the menu was pretty clear what I'd be getting so I knew what to expect.  A few things that you could call non-traditional -  they used cheddar cheese (not cotija or fresca), they poured the salsa on the chips, the chips aren't cooked in the salsa, and finally they topped it off with a big old turkey sausage! 

So you're probably thinking why I'd give 4 stars to this abomination???  Because it was delicious and it filled me up - what more can you ask for?  The chips were good and held up on their own, even without the salsa.  The salsa was delicious!  Spicy but not too hot - just enough to help with the mild hangover.  The eggs were nice and fluffy and they served a good amount of them.  The Sausage was a little on the sweet side, but still really good.

I tried a little bit of my brothers chicken fried steak.  The breading was nice and thick and tasted amazing.  The steak was a really thick cut - none of that thin milanesa type steak.  The home fries were top notch - nice and crispy on the outside and light on the inside.

Oh & the coffee was excellent as well.

So what was the boner move?  They brought the check about 5 minutes after the food hit the table - I hate that...  I don't care if they say "no rush" I still hate it.  Other then that the service was good, they checked on us a couple of times, coffee cup never went empty.

I'll definitely be back next time I'm in downtown for breakfast."}

When the waiter finally came, I felt like we were inconveniencing him.  He didn't really speak to us, it was more like a drive through: "Drinks?", "Eat?", "That it?".

My husband and I went around 7pm on Memorial Day.  I was afraid it would be hard to find parking, but we easily found a spot right in front of the restaurant and headed in.  

The hostess was friendly and offered us indoor or outdoor patio seating.  We chose indoor.  I love the aesthetic of the restaurant!  The tables, lighting, plants, everything.  Our server quickly came over to greet us and take our drink order.  My husband ordered the Jamaican Hibiscus Punch and it was AMAZING!  Perfect blend of sweet and a slight savory-ness to it.  Since it was our first time dining here, we asked the server for his suggestions on what to order.  He was very knowledgable and definitely steered us in a great food direction.  

Onto the food...
-For appetizers we had the Mexican Hummus and Hot Tamales.  Both were amazing!  I was actually really shocked at how great both were.  The tamales had the perfect blend of spices.  
-For one entree we went for the East West Tacos which were bbq jackfruit.  My husband who is usually a carnivore, was severely impressed by these!  Texture was great and the flavor was fantastic!  Homemade tortillas.  Total score.  
-Our other entree was the Casa Blanca.  Quinoa and Moroccan spiced veggies.  The spices were great.  Good amount of heat, but not too overpowering.  I make a lot of dishes like this at home and I was still impressed.

The waitress I had was a different story she was the dumbest waitress I have ever encountered anywhere. I don't know what her name was and I doubt she could remember it if I asked her. She was tall and brown hair and cross eyed. First it took forever to bring us drinks because she forgot us multiple times. We asked for straws and I understand sometimes you run out of things but she was back searching for an eternity and came back with two straws (there were four of us) and asked who wanted them. Awkward. She should have just said they were out. She then brought us our check but it had already been paid by someone else....ok do we just leave? So we confronted her about it and she gave us some BS dumb answer how she misused the plus and subtracted our....what?! She ran in the back and we never saw the brown haired blond the rest of our visit. Thankfully the good looking restaurant manager swooped in and saved the day by fixing our check she was on top of things. We will be returning soon but only because the food was amazing.49$ for 4 people"}

$42.62 got us some spaghetti and meatballs for the boy, an orange smoothie, a greek salad, a dumpling appetizer, and a quesadilla.  
.
$6.00 Orange burst smoothie- Consists of orange, carrot, ginger, turmeric, and pineapple. It is served in a cute mason jar which is appropriate because it tastes just like a scented candle.  
.
Sadly they were all out of the "save the tuna" vegan sushi so we had to settle for the My Little Dumpling appetizer for $6.95. The steamed shiitake & spinach dumplings were served in an adorable bamboo steamer basket.  I very much enjoyed these.  They are served with chopsticks and a tasty soy-based dipping sauce. 
.
$10.95 Muchas Gracias- Organic sweet potato quesadilla with black beans and chipotle crema.  Husband quite enjoyed this.  It was served very hot and fresh.  
.
$10.95 Greek salad- Has feta, kale, romaine, red peppers, green peppers, onions, vinagrette, olives, and oddly enough- tortilla chips.  I found the tortilla chips to be out of place in a greek salad but I enjoyed the vegan feta cheese more than I thought I would.

$7.00 Chocolate tacos- Delicate crunchy pastry shell with chocolate goop, chopped strawberries, coconut, more mystery goop on top, and HUGE PIECES OF ROCK SALT...like the kind you use to make ice cream! I liked everything but the ginormous hunks of salt, which, according to our waitress and the chef, are supposed to be in there.  I sincerely hope nobody loses a tooth eating one of these.  The waitress was nice enough to take it off our bill.  
.
That's alright because I didn't have "mushroom" in my tummy for dessert anyways.  I should also mention that they wanted us to wait 20 minutes and we had to ask if they'd 'lettuce' sit on the terrace.  They did not 'carrot' all that we had no utensils or napkins the entire time we were there.  Overall I'm glad to have 'bean' there but 'olive' myself and my wallet too much to go back.  Peas!"}

Look up Yelp and this place comes up with a ton of great reviews. Jump in a cab and before you know it we arrive.

First off this place is super cool, no weird EDC people here when we walk in so that is a huge plus.

I will say this, of all the vegetarian places I have eaten since being married to my awesome wife, this place by far is the best.

Honestly, it's freakin good.

The staff is perfect, the chef is incredible. The place is cute and just makes you feel at home when your walk in.

The "chicken" waffle is the best waffle anything I have ever had. The biscuit and gravy was just down right good. Everything was dead on.

I love this place, please come to the Heights in Houston . . . ."}

Then reason why I give this place 2 stars is because of the service/staff. Every point of contact from the hostess, to our server, and the food runner were rude, short, and had very bad attitudes. The hostess gave us a hard time about seating us when our table had already been set up with high chair and everything, but wanted to wait till the rest of the party showed up; which, understandable but you already set up the table. It seemed as though the service staff were so overwhelmed with the busyness that they were frustrated and were taking it out on us. After we told the hostess the rest of our party was parking, she made a snide remark that we need to order before they closed (and they closed in 2 hours). The food runner had dropped our food at the wrong seats so while we switched them she sighed and rolled her eyes. Our waiter dropped off our check before we were even finished eating our entrees without even asking for it. We then wanted to order more coffees and desserts after our meal, but didn't seem to have the option to because we felt rushed and pushed out. It's such a shame because all the food was absolutely amazing."}

The parking is pay to park and it's easy to miss if you have never been there before. 

Their breakfast is pretty delicious, they have the biggest slices of bread that I have ever seen and their pancakes are ridiculously good! 

I also fantasize about their cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote.

The few things that I don't like, is that we have never had a friendly waiter/waitress. For some reason, the 4 times I have been there, the waitstaff always acts like they are doing us a favor by helping us and they try to suggestively sell you sides of everything or bigger sizes of whatever you ordered, I understand the concept but it gets pretty annoying when you are trying to place an order on a table of 6 and 2 to 3 extra things are suggested to every person. 

I also have to warn you that their veggie burger is terrible! So the next time I went I ordered another dish without the bacon and the waitress said "we are too busy right now to make any substitutions" uhmm I wasn't making a substitution, I just said no bacon.... Anyway! 

Eat is actually worth a try because everything is made from scratch and their food is high quality, I just wish the staff was friendly."}

Across from the new container park, eat. is a casual spot to grab some solid lunch and breakfast fare. I'm a sandwich first, ask questions later kind of guy, so I've yet to test out the breakfast, but everything I've had on the lunch side of things has been excellent. The free range chicken sandwich is served on a light, crunchy ciabatta with a juicy chicken breast and fresh toppings. The reuben is large and the best I've had in Vegas, the veggie burger is made on-site and the passion fruit iced tea is unsweetened, so it just has a hint of tropical flavor in it. Sold? I thought so. See ya there.

It was crowded on a Sunday morning, but fortunately, my uncle, living right around the corner, had the foresight to put our name in an hour before we intended to be there. When I arrived, my Mimi and I were greeted with wonderful coffee and plates of deliciously gooey and warm berry-covered biscuits. I ordered the shrimp and grits, sans bacon pieces, while my family ordered the chicken-fried steak. 

My shrimp and grits was phenomenal, especially paired with the sourdough toast served with the meal. Within the shrimp and grits were two fried eggs that were cooked perfectly to my specification. Each bite was an explosion of flavor that my tongue begged for more. ;) Everyone in my party was pleased with their meal -- my uncle mentioned that the cut of meat was a little tough, but still good.

Monday morning we took off to Eat. for breakfast about 9a.  For 9a, off the strip, on a monday- I didn't expect them to be so busy.  But they were hopping!  We were promptly seated and looked through the amazing menu.

I couldn't ask for a better send off meal.  I wanted to try everything - but stuck with the simple 2 eggs.  So good.  I am not a big bread eater.  Typically when my meal comes with bread - i take it or leave it.  However - at Eat. they do the bread in a skillet - similar to how you do a grilled cheese.  I devoured every morsel of bread.  Everything else was amazing too - but that bread.

Shrimp and Grits: pretty much self explanatory, served with bacon strips, butterflied shrimp, topped with over easy eggs and homemade sauce. The eggs were something different but a nice touch.

Hubby ordered the special Downtown Benedict. He loved it too. Coffee was hot, lemon water chilled and service fast and extremely friendly.  Totally hit the spot after drinking too much in DLV.

 We sat at the table for quite some time before the server showed up.  Then he asks if we have any questions about the menu but then fails to mention that they changed it and some items are not made any more.   "Oops!"  This would be fine if it didn't happen a second time for dessert!   If they were really concerned about it the hostess and the 2 servers standing there talking at the host stand could have scratched out the items they don't serve anymore (which was done to the "amended" dessert menu we received.

We came for a health and fitness conference and many of us enjoy plant based dietary choices. Some have gluten and dairy limits.

I am not a vegan, but eat mostly plant based. I felt invited and not judged. That is fairly hard in this type of circle, so thank you. 



We were told to try your restaurant by other vegans in the area. My friends were both plant based, vegetarian and vegan that I came with. We also met the 2 influential vegan lifestyle body building pros at Vegenation in town for the conference.

 I got a wonderful starter of buffalo cauliflower, ranch, and celery. Delicious! 

I followed it with a meal, I returned. It was great, but I dont like curry and it didnt say it had it in their on the menu. I couldn't order much else because I have an allergy to chipotle and it was in almost everything, even their black beans. And a sensitivity to mushrooms so that knocked out a few others. I just followed up with a dessert, chocolate tacos. They were yummy, a little salty, but very good. teeny tacos, could use to be bigger. 


I would have tried many other things had they used cayenne and not chipotle...but it is the trendiest spice right now besides turmeric so I get it. I did think too much of one flavor limits a menu though, especially in a plant based field. It would have been nice to see some interesting salads and soups and maybe some dipping bread. I have tried so many places in Seattle with the vegetarian vibe and I think Vegenation could do so much more with their passion. 

But it was flavorful and great service, I would go again, if chipotle wasn't so prominent. Their ranch was perfect! I would buy a bottle."}

The food is amazing though (only reason for the four stars). The pancakes are golden with yummy, yummy syrup. The deviled eggs are pretty good too; though; I wouldn't just order that. Again, the truffled egg sandwich is delicioussssssss. Truffle is just YUM. You must order this sandwich."}

Sushi was colorful, beautifully presented and pretty good. The meatball sub was pretty good as was the sweet potato quesadilla.  The smoothies were well received. The lemonade had chia in it, which one of the kids didn't care for. 

We sat at the community table which was cool. The atmosphere is great. They had live music during our Sunday afternoon visit. Music was good & not too loud to enjoy conversation.

Corned Beef Hash ($14): Chunks of corned beef with savory potatoes, 2 poached eggs and 4 pieces of sourdough toasted to perfection. Realy enjoyed the toast here. The portion size was fair but a little on the pricier side for a brunch item. 

Eggs Benedict ($13): Wasn't my favorite item =/ breadding on bottom was sweet and turkey bacon was used instead of regular. Poo. I love turkey bacon but a girl's trying to get some delicious bad food in me while in Vegas!! However, the caramelized onions and potatoes were on point.

Free-Range Chicken Sandwich ($12): This dish sounds average and something you can get anywhere but my oh my. The chicken wasn't dry. The pesto, mozzarella cheese and pesto blend was beyond perfect. I tried savoring every last bite of it! YUM. I tend to lean more on brunch items during brunch hours but this dish is one to get!

All dishes were decently sized. Hipster type of atmosphere. Location is off.. it's underneath an apartment/studio complex! Lots of metered street parking for $1/hour. Something to try while out in Vegas!"}

I like the ambience, but I felt the customer service lacked.  The hostess who sat us, barely made eye contact and showed us where to sit by waving in the direction of an empty table.  Our waiter, Robert, seemed rushed and wasn't friendly or pleasant.    I ordered the chicken friend steak and asked for the gravy on the side, but when it arrived, my food was covered in gravy.  Before I could ask for a change, the server who brought the food already rushed off.  I relented and ate my food as it came, but was pleasantly surprised.  I normally don't like too much gravy on my food, but the gravy was delicious.  My party also ordered the beignets for the table.  The other reviews on beignets were mixed, so we wanted to try them out for ourselves.  As most reviewers noted, the beignets were dense and not flaky and light like they're suppose to be.  That being said, they still tasted pretty good.

I intend to come back because although it was just an average visit, I see the potential of this place turning into a great local spot.  I think that the staff have to be more friendly and attentive, but otherwise, this is a place that I would still recommend."}

   I have never been disappointed in my food and have been there about ten times.  There are things I liked better than others.  Muchas Gracias Sweet Potato Quesadilla is killer.  As are the Italian Dumplings which are sweet potato pecan ravioli in a buerre-blanc-ish sauce with asparagus and radicchio.  They serve kombucha which is not made in house but is also always tasty.  The dessert tacos are cute and tasty.  The vanilla ice cream is the best I have ever had.  Affordable and convenient kids menu too!  Most kids dishes are $3.95!! Can't beat it.
    They are 100% vegan.  They support local businesses.  They get involved with the community.  They have a hip urban vibe.  Non-gmo and organic abundance.
    The only reason I wouldn't give them five stars is service.  More often than not the servers seem flustered or scattered.  I work in the industry so I know how it goes but sometimes it's just like 'Really?!'.  We've had wrong food brought to us more than once, a server ran our credit card on the wrong bill the other night, had to ask for silverware after receiving our meals on multiple occasions, ask for water refills, etc...  And these incidents occur when it doesn't even appear to be busy.  But nothing ever that bad or that is anything other than an accident.  All friendly staff, some particularly knowledgable about the menu, not overpriced, and the food doesn't ever take too long.

  Definitely worth going too again and again!"}

Excellent, Awesome, and Terrific, would be a good mnemonic device to remember this wonderful restaurant. Here are three reasons why I liked the place so much:

1) The food was EXCELLENT! I had the Bánh Mì Sandwich with tofu and seasonal slaw on a baguette, served with a pickle spear and potato salad. The tofu was firm and slightly crispy, the slaw fresh and full of flavor, and the baguette soaked up the sandwich's delicious sauces without becoming soggy or mushy. I prefer a mustard-based potato salad, but the traditional one that came with my meal was a-ok. Tangent: I think it's cute that the menu describes the additional side as "a really good pickle." Really! Overall, the meal filled me up without leaving me feeling bloated or gross--- perfect lunch portions! I ate every last bite!

2) The staff was AWESOME. It appeared as though the owner and/or head chef was present, seated towards the side/back of the restaurant, close to where we were eating. (This might have been a contributing factor to the good service, but whatevs.) I always appreciate when owners/chefs are visibly present in the restaurant. To me, it speaks volumes and shows they actually care about their patrons, the food, and the community. Thanks for that!

3) The restaurant looked TERRIFIC. It was exceptionally clean and also well decorated. I loved the variety of high tables and regular tables, make it perfect for groups, a business lunch, or a romantic meal. Side note: I went on a Friday at about 1:00 pm, and although I didn't have to wait for a table, the place was BUSY. I wouldn't be surprised if there are normally wait times, so plan ahead.

Eat was E-xcellent, A-wesome, and T-errific. A good name for a good restaurant! I'll definitely have to return for breakfast."}

I loved the quesadilla but my friend and I both agreed that it needed something else in it, maybe corn or peppers to add more texture since sweet potato and black beans are already both really mushy.

Today for example I ordered the special and I clearly got food that was sitting around. My order came in a whole 30 seconds. The bread was toasted hard but not warm the spinach was wilted. 

The waitress didn't seem to care, sort of shrugged it off. They got their money, I'm not one to start anything in the restaurant, I just write yelp reviews.

I work right near this place and I know it has a high ceiling so I'm sure I'll give it another try but my disappointment is high right now."}

The community table is such a great atmosphere for groups and lunchoens. There are live plants throughout the restaurant that make the dining that much more enjoyable. The community table particularly is lined with plants above that ground you in the feeling of nature. Even if you dont know anyone around you while sitting at the comunity table, you will feel like a part of a family as you meet the many uniqe people who frequent VegeNation.

The food is incredible. The texture of the "chicken" is fantastic and the flavors of the food are extremely impressive. The drinks are also amazing. From the smoothies, to the lemonade, to the craft beer and couragous cocktails. There is definitely something to be said about a Vegan Restaurant that serves alcohol. A definite must go. Perfect for lunch."}

Food was approachable and tasty. Service was excellent. We started with the cauliflower wings. They fool the palette, that's how yummy they are, as they look and taste like chicken wings! The sauce was tangy and had a kick. And the faux chicken and waffle dish was delicious. The faux chicken had a sauce that was creamy and the waffles were crispy. The prices were reasonable and we will definitely be back for some vegan dessert! Also, try their greens smoothie. Hubby had one and I took sips... a great hangover cure. It was epic!"}

I have gone 4 times in the past week and love it. The cold brew coffee with free refills is a very nice option if you like coffee. The peanut butter banana chocolate smoothie is epic! It is so good it can be a dessert or enjoyed before the meal. As for food, I highly recommend the mushroom sliders (downtown tony), the "chicken" pot pie, and the bow wow. The veggie burger was kind of meh, but that is the only thing I didn't very much enjoy. 

For being vegan, you don't even realize you're eating food that is plant based. The sweet potato is another quality menu item. The pizzas are light and somewhat tasty, but I would recommend you order infinity mushroom sliders. When it comes to dessert, the carrot cake and blueberry cheesecake are both delectable, but the peanut butter almond milk based ice cream is fabulous! In short, highly recommend this amazing restaurant."}

We order Save The Tuna purple rice sushi roll which was so good , buffalo cauliflower that was amazing this pieces was pretty big it had a nice crunch and just the right amount of sauce. We also order the vegan burger and country cut style fries that was equally tasty. We also tried the jackfruit tacos that I wasn't a fan of but my husband was in love with the bbq favorited jackfruit. To each it's own. 

Over all I enjoyed my experience and is so grateful that they took our order. This is a good place to go for vegan selections."}

The first few bites of our dishes (vegenation burger & muchas gracias) were a bit spicy but we think it was the home made ketchup & just uneven spicing in the quesadilla. I wanted an appetizer but wanted to have room for dessert & am SO glad I saved room. We got the warm apple cobbler & it was amazing! One thing I would change would be the apples - I could do without the skin on but it isn't a deal breaker. I would order this dessert again & again if I lived nearby. My kids got plain pasta and meatballs. The meatballs had more spices/flavor than they're used to but the leftovers made a great sandwich for me the next day!"}

If you're eco/health conscious, this is the perfect place for you. Everything is locally sourced and plant based. I was surprised at the big portion sizes. I was expecting to still be hungry but I was actually quite full. The prices here are pretty reasonable, too ($7-10 a plate).

If you check in on Yelp, you get a delicious glass of Sangria. I ordered the Save the Tuna appetizer (vegetarian sushi), which was amazing. I was trying to decide between the meatball sub and quesadilla. The server recommended the sub, but now I wish I had the quesadilla. The sub was good, but not amazing. I'll have to come back and try the quesadilla.

My only complaint is that I wish the menus were more visual/included pictures of the items. Seeing all that text is overwhelming."}

My husband ordered the black bean burger, and again flavor on point, HOWEVER it fell apart faster than Kim K's marriage to Chris humphries.

We also had the wannabe Tuna sushi roll and I can honestly say it filled my craving for sushi. Lastly, the brownie Sunday to finish it all up. Was delicious but brownie was too small.

I'm not super picky so I drank it, but I would have preferred it colder.

My friend got the iced coffee, she enjoyed it and we split the black bean hummus, which was DELICIOUS. I was really skeptical as I enjoy hummus greatly, and I found that I really enjoyed that one. 

The service was wonderful, and they let us sit for a couple hours, we didn't feel rushed to leave or anything. They refilled her coffee a couple times and provided waters with refills. The ambiance was really interesting, it was a really cool place and I would definitely be back to try more of their food rather than just the smoothie and hummus (though again...that hummus was fantastic)."}

I tried this place twice while I was here in Vegas. Both visits we decided to do take out because we just wanted to relax in our hotel (it was literally less than a mile from where we were staying)

My first visit I ordered the bao buns and the chicken pot pie gnocchi. They were both fairly delicious! I didn't get to finish my gnocchi tho because my hotel room didn't have a refrigerator :( lol 

My second visit was a let down. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings, the hot tamales, and the Daniel Negreanu. My partner ordered the spicy picante pineapple pizza and the east west tacos. 
The cauliflower wings weren't bad but the hot tamale was a super disappointment tho considering how they were voted the best in Las Vegas. They were extremely dry and had very little filling. 
The Daniel Negreanu (which is meatball sub) wasn't bad but the fries were stale and they only gave me like three fries? Lol so I guess if you order something to go make sure it doesn't come with fries 
My partner's spicy picante pizza was good! Only complaint was that it was pretty small even for a personal size pizza. The east west tacos however weren't good. The sauce was extremely sweet and the tortillas were breaking apart when we tried to eat them :/ 

All in all, it isn't a bad place. It has a nice atmosphere and the staff is so friendly! Unfortunately the menu for us was a hit or miss so we're not sure we might come back next time we're in Vegas"}

VegeNation is a great plant based option for dishes that are flavorful and healthy. If you're looking for a Vegan restaurant in town, this is a must visit location.

Pros:
- The dishes taste so good that they make you forget that you're eating vegan food
- The french toast and waffles are to die for!
- The decor is very green and hipster looking :-D
- I go here the first Sunday of each month as a part of the Reset Project and love their breakfast options. 

Cons:
- It's a little noisy in the restaurant which makes conversation a little difficult during busy times
- Not all food is 100% organic (but they source it that way the best they can)

Final Verdict:
VegeNation is a wonderful restaurant for people looking for more plant based options that taste great. I know meat eaters that go to this place and love it!"}

My boyfriend and I are vegan/vegetarian. It's HARD to come to Vegas regularly for long days of strategic work and find healthy food to fuel our brains. This has been our FAVORITE place in LV. We even got to chat with the owners last month for a second to express our gratitude when they had the guest pop up chef from LA. Excitement grew as we learned they are on GrubHub although issues struck when I found that GrubHub would not deliver far enough in the span of a block. They will deliver to 4365 but not to 4500 on the street so I decided to call to see if something could work. I get a lovely lady named AARON (sorry if I misspelled your name lovely!) and she sent me to PostMates because they normally deliver as far as you want so I tried that but still no luck. I called back trying to see if I can figure something out. You all know that moment when your heart becomes set on having such delicious food. I ask for her because she was SUPER HELPFUL, KIND, and COMPASSIONATE ABOUT PROVIDING A GREAT EXPERIENCE. She said it was weird that they weren't showing up. So then she says "Ok, try one more called EatStreet. If that doesn't work call back." At this moment, after the call, I turn to my boyfriend and go "OMG I love the vegan/vegetarian culture because people are so genuinely nice and they want to help you! They know how important it is to eat well." My heart filled with love just because of her kindness I get back on my computer and try EatStreet. Unfortunately, EatStreet also said delivery unavailable. Now keep in mind I had just put down 50 MINUTES OF MY TIME to figure out how to order this food. I even offered to pay more to get it. We also discussed having GrubHub drop it off at the strip club down the street. 

So I call back and ask for Aaron again and the host said hold on...

"Hello this is DONALD," an agitated, grumpy voice came on the phone. I try to tell him my situation but I can barely get through it by the time his negative energy cuts me off and says "We are in downtown and only deliver so far." I told him I understand that but I was working with Aaron to see if we couldn't figure something out. I told him she directed me to EatStreet but if I still had problems call back. No joke he says "Try EatStreet." I repeat myself. I'm a little frustrated with his attitude but my voice was still calm and nice trying to work with him. Again he was soggy and said "The Orleans is too far, the delivery companies only go a certain radius." 
I was also literally OK with jumping in a taxi and meeting GrubHub down the street. Aaron may not have even been able to condone that but she was sincerely trying to help and her help wasn't taking her off the floor for more than a minute each time I called. (Now I have also worked at many restaurants from serving to bartending in downtown San Francisco and San Diego. I know a minute does effect flow but there are lovely other options on how to deal with inquisitive customers like myself.) 
I could feel his negative energy through the phone and I choose not to deal with toxic energy. I ask for Aaron because she knows what's up. DONALD replies to me as if I'm one of his employees (obviously the manager) trying to distract him from a rush, "Aaron can't come to the phone, she's on the floor right now. It's lunch time. It's busy!" In my head I'm like, duh, why else would I be trying to order food from you... It's close to lunch. I told him he was providing poor customer service and he hung up on me....HE HUNG UP ON ME. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!! No "Could you please try calling back later?", no "I'm sorry miss I don't know what else we can do for you.", No suggestions to another restaurant or hey even try another vegetarian search around your area with the GPS on. There were SO many other ways he could have dealt with this situation. DONALD WAS NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT KIND. I wouldn't have been mad or anything if he or Aaron couldn't help me as long as they were kind about it! 

Needless to say when we go to VegeNation this week I hope Aaron is working so I can express how much gratitude I have for people like her. I hope she knows her light shines through his darkness. I hope all the employees can block out the negativity as well. I know what it's like to have a blood-sucking boss. I hope eventually the owners of VegeNation will take a step toward bettering their workplace environment by finding a replacement for DONALD. He needs to work at a restaurant that supports his negative attitude rather than working at a restaurant in which part of their values are to "Do good by people." 

P.S. Congrats Donald..This is the most time I've ever spent writing a review!

Eek! Methinks not about Donald!!"}

We had the buffalo cauliflower which was good enough that he had me make some when we got back home. A lot of places make a buffalo cauliflower, but it isn't crispy like the one here. And the house ranch dressing-OMG! The shiitake potstickers were good but not amazing. I REALLY enjoyed the eggplant stacks. It was super reminiscent of chicken Parmesan. They did it really well. The staff are friendly, and the owner is very involved. We came in twice during our stay, and he was there both times. Great place for vegetarians, vegans and meat-lovers to unite!"}

Being vegan usually means not having options in most cities. But Vegenation shatters that! To date, my favorite meal has to be the "Chicken"-N-Waffles. It comes with a side of giant fries, their signature ketchup, and a creamy sauce that is heaven! Now because it's only offered on Saturdays, I come here every Saturday! I've been on a 3 week chicken-n-waffle streak. Nuff said. 

Now when I'm in the mood for something else, the "Meatball" grinder is also amazing! Comes with the giant fries too. (SN: Ask for a side of the creamy "Chicken"-N-Waffles sauce). It's the best mix of savory and sweet. 

Now, dessert. Whatever you do, you must get the ice cream sundae. First time I had it, I had to call our waitress back and verify with her that this was actually a vegan restaurant and not a vegetarian restaurant! I will say without flinching, it's better than Blue Bell ice cream. If you've had Blue Bell, you're probably scoffing right now. But try it, then try scoffing.

I'll be back again and again and again."}

Located just off the strip, tucked in a quaint neighborhood that is taking on new life, you will find a gold mine in Vegenation! My first time here, I didn't know what to expect so I used YELP to help guide me through the decision making process. We walked in and was met with a friendly hello, music artist playing live, smoothie tasting and a serene vibe. It was just what we needed after a long hot day bouncing about. I got the mushroom, basil pizza, and my crew got the tamale, and biscuits and gravy with collard greens. We all found our food to be delicious and well seasoned. One in my group did feel the collard greens should have been a larger portion. As soon as she brought it to the attention of the server, she was immediately accommodated with a larger portion. This is the type of service one would expect at any establishment but often is not the case. Vegenation has such a beautiful energy that is felt immediately upon arrival. The experience was so lovely that I asked to speak with the manager and get contact information of the owners. Little did I know one was onsight. I got to share my appreciation of the space with him as well as his staff. Amy and Marnie are amazing servers and Jessica does an awesome job of navigating the ship in her Manager position. I really appreciate the time spent in restaurants or any company in the service industry that pays attention to creating good energy. Oh, one more thing...please make a point to see the patio area! The outdoor space was enchanting and the photo ops...are Instagram worthy for SURE!!! After eating, we spent another 20mins taking photos on the patio. Anyway, definitely stop in and eat, drinks and be merry...and share some great energy!!! Happy Eating!!!"}

My mom and I were in Las Vegas for a softball tournament and wanted to venture out of the hotel for dinner. I've been vegan for about 4 months now so I decided to search Yelp for an interesting, healthy, and delicious vegan spot for our meal. I found Vegenation and was lured in by the gorgeous pictures of pink sushi and a bright green living wall. Unfortunately, although a cute and casual environment, this excursion was horrible. 

I won't bore you anymore with all of the lengthy details so here is a summary of our disappointing night-

CONS- 
*weird and uninviting smell
*THE WORST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant...waitress was awkward and distant, never cleared our menus or plates, and brought our appetizers and dinner all at the same time
*AVERAGE main courses- something you could buy from the frozen section (soggy bread and watery pasta sauce) 

PROS
*pretty setting
*delicious appetizers (dumplings & tamales)
*nice white wine


OVERALL don't come here & waste money on mediocre food and services

I feel like this place could have been so much nicer with higher quality food and better service!"}

It has been hyped up for months, so when We heard it was finally open, it was imperative that we check it out. Parking was easy on a Tuesday night and we were seated promptly. 

The ambiance... Ugh. It was so bright, almost like cafeteria lighting. No candles on the table, no small plants or flowers, very bare and very bright. They did have a huge wall of green plants on the wall to the right of the door. We were sat in booth by the server station and kitchen so perhaps that's why it was stark white and bare? I dunno, kind of killed the mood. The bathrooms are also bright and completely white. Clean, but on a busy night, I could imagine it not looking so sparkly. 

Our server... Very polite and excited about her job. Believed in the company and to me, that is more important than remembering to clear menus or forgetting an empty plate. She did box our food for us which was really nice, and brought extra chips for our hummus. She checked on us quite a bit... And our waters were always full. Please note, they are still learning the computer systems so be patient when you ask for your check to be split. She was also very honest about the food and her favorite items on the menu. She obviously tasted everything she recommended because she was very descriptive... This is probably what's earning them their fourth star...great service. 

Now on to the food... We ordered three apps and four entrees. Nothing was overly impressive. But the presentation was executed perfectly. 

Mexican black bean hummus: highlight of the apps we tried. Extremely flavorful and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, it comes with corn tortilla chips. The chips were good, but a veggie option would of made this dish a perfect 10 for me. I'm not into corn based anything Regardless of the bag reading organic... Because of all the gmos. 

Save the tuna: pretty fairly large portion for the price. It was tasty and I appreciated that they weren't using white rice. It needed something... Perha¿f  Yeah... It was definitely lacking nori. They did use some interesting fruits and veggies though. 

My little dumplings... Small portion for the price. They were over cooked, definitely not firm enough for our tastes... A little soggy. The sauce saved them... Without it, it would of been a total bust. 

My boyfriend ordered the gotta get over the hemp. They used the quinoa pasta instead of the rice noodles for us. Over cooked and mushy, definitely not al dente. It was really just okay. Neither of us were impressed. It needed more basil pesto... Or something... Because it was really lacking flavor. We wouldn't order it again... The vegan pesto at slice is way better. 

I ordered the out of Africa yam stew. It was probably my favorite dish of the evening. Lots of delicious veggies in a spicy peanut sauce over a bed of quinoa. Flavorful and healthy and cooked perfectly. I Would order it again. 

My friend ordered the little soul. They were full of collard greens and black eyes peas. Tastey... But once again lacking something. Over cooked again. The sauce once again saved the dish. They were prepared as the dumplings the first time and she received her food 10 min after everyone else got theirs. The server apologized, but nothing was taken off the bill and all of our food was cold by the time we could start eating. 

Her boyfriend ordered a vegenation burger...Nice play on a popular food item. I can't say it looked appetizing. I hate meat and everything about it, so this dish definitely was not for me. It looked like straight up ground beef. He is not vegan but seemed to enjoy it. The fries looked good though.

The drinks: I had the red blend African wine. It was Very good. Our friends ordered the bourbon cocktail and the piña colada. Both were good. The piña colada was very fresh and natural, not overly sweet it was a great summer beverage. 

Overall, this place is definitely new and has a lot of potential. They are working out the kinks and still learning the menu. I do feel like table touching from managers or supervisors is very important right now for their business, and that was definitely lacking. I'll probably be back in a month or so... And give them some more time to figure things out. Definitely sticking to Violettes until they work out the kinks."}

They found the right formula. I absolutely love the "Out of Africa" dish. It's a stew of yams, chickpeas, quinoa, kale, peanuts and spices that's filling, nutritious, and tasty. Other dishes are also quite good, such as the tamales. My only real criticism is that the menu descriptions are lacking. If there's a strong flavor in a dish it should be mentioned but often isn't. For instance, the gnocchi they're serving now is topped with nutritional yeast but that's not mentioned on the menu. It's a strong flavor, like cilantro or eggplant, and should be mentioned."}

I came in to eat with a party of four. One of the people I was with has a service dog. We put our name on the waiting list. Eventually, we are next to be seated and there was a four-top table in the front of the restaurant. It was a really beautiful day, so we were excited to get the table by the window. However, the hostess came to inform us that we have to be seated in the back area. Upon asking why, she replied that it VegeNation's policy to seat service animals outside. We specifically asked to be at the open table by the window. With attitude, she told us, no. Bewildered but starving at this point, we just agreed to go outside. Like I said, it was a nice day... It was actually my birthday. So, I didn't exactly want to get into things. 

Our server was so forgetful. She got our orders wrong for different things. We needed to remind her two or three times about the same forgotten item. It was extremely disappointing. There were also periods of time where it seemed like she disappeared - almost like she forgot to come check on us. There was also a table next to us that was full of dishes. It was left for the entire time we dined. 

There was also an employee on break or something outside on the table by us. He was sleeping or listening to music with his eyes closed. Ordinarily, I wouldn't care but it just seemed like it was the employee break room as opposed to a dining area. Later in the meal, two employees came outside to another one of the tables to do silverware, so it added to the break room feel. 

During our meal, a couple was seated outside. After a few minutes, they requested to be seated inside, and their request was honored. 

Later, we inquired again why we were forced to sit outside. Another employee said that there was a person with a dog allergy inside, so they had to seat us in the back. At this point, I'm livid. Was it a restaurant policy or because it was somehow known that someone had a dog allergy? Someone lied to us. And, on top of all that, the restaurant is NOT allowed to do this. Regardless of either reasons, it is not allowed. According to Nevada State Law, they are not allowed to force us to eat in a specific section (i.e., outside) because we had a service animal in our party. The management will be receiving a more detailed letter regarding this matter. I really hope they take this into consideration when making policies or training their employees. 

Food was okay. Nothing special. Service was horrible. It isn't very often that I leave a food establishment actually mad. This was one of them."}

Located on Carson Ave. amidst several other new bistros, Vegenation is a structly vegan joint. We had the mushroom bao, the mushroom pizza and finished off with a chocolate brownie sunday. The sunday is free for signing up for their email list. Our waiter Michael was outstanding. He made great menu suggestions and was fast and friendly. Overall, I highly recommend vegenation for the excellent staff as much as the food."}

Whether you are an omnivore like me or a hardcore vegan, I guarantee that you will be very satisfied with their offerings.

My (vegetarian) wife and I were here recently for Sunday brunch. It had a cool ambiance that my wife thought was more "hipster" than "hippie". Maybe she meant that it was clean? We sat at the community table which really did seem to be a community of sorts. Friends and strangers chatted amiably and listened to the talented guitarist/singer (they have live music every Sunday.)

We started with a French press of Peruvian coffee. Our very nice server told us how long it had to steep for and our brew was robust but also mellow and not bitter.

We shared Save the Tuna, which was really fresh and delicious. It didn't seem like there was any mock tuna in it, but the avocado was so tasty that nothing seemed missing. If you are like me and you do enjoy raw fish, just keep in mind that this dish is not trying to be a facsimile.

I chose Daniel Negreanu for my entree, and I'm glad that I did. This was an East Coast style Italian meatball grinder, all right. If you don't like the taste or texture of meat, don't get this because the meatballs were very realistic. Our server said that they get them from a place in the Bay Area, so I doubt that they're any brand that I've heard of. The "parmesan" is probably not Daiya because it tasted more cheese-like (actually, I don't think Daiya makes a parmesan product.) This is a perfect example of how vegan food can be hearty and satisfying.

In fact, I shared my sandwich with my wife and I was too full to help her with her off-menu order of chicken and waffles. The tiny taste of the chick'n (or should that be "chickun"?) that I got was pretty meaty, so be forewarned.

We checked in on Yelp and got the free brownie sundae. I didn't exactly save room for it, but I somehow devoured my fair share. I would love to know what kind of ice cream it was (rice cream? almond cream?) Wonderful!

VegeNation just made our list of must-visit places for every time that we come to Vegas. I think that two-for-one happy hour is calling our names!"}

My boyfriend ordered the pho-king delicious, he said it really was delicious. It looked good but my food was so good I didn't want to try his. I was full after eating all that but really wanted to try the tiramasu. It was ok, not something I would order again. But I'm not a coffee drinker and the cake was coffee soaked. With the exception of the desert, I would eat there again and probably order all of the same items. One of the best vegan meals I've had out yet!! Our waitress was friendly and helpful.

I love how they have an actual DJ there during the day. I thought that was pretty neat. It's a medium sized facility and we had no trouble finding street parking. (We DID have to pay the meter). Waitress was attentive though after ordering the tamales as an appetizer she came back very cheery to ask how they were to which I replied with a sad face "not good", her smile dropped instantly and I felt bad for telling the truth. On the upside, my husband and I "checked in" receiving 2 free sangrias which we were happy about cause they are very pricey on the menu. On the downside, they tasted mediocre at best. I didn't even finish mine and I'm still curious as to why they are so expensive when they tasted the way they did. On the upside, the "meatball" sub and the "chicken" pot pie saved the meal and were worth the money. We ordered a cheesecake as well which was edible however keep in mind the crust is overwhelming nutty and nut flavored. It didn't phase me much but my husband passed on it after the first bite. Anyway, there's my roller coaster ride of a review on this one."}

I had the Tamale and we split the Mexican hummus for an app. Too much food and too good! I was blown away by that alone. 
Then came the mains. I had spaghetti and "meat"balls while she had the Vegi Phó.
Mine was so authentic that I bet most people wouldn't know it wasn't meat unless you told them and tasty as heck too. Hers was the size of Texas and she loved it as well. 
Very worth the wait, good prices, awesome food. CHECK IT OUT!! They weren't voted in the top 10 of the country for nothing, don't miss your chance."}

Started with the Yelp Check-In giftie - a glass of lovely Apple Cider Sangria. Light and delicious.

Ordered the Meatball sub, which was really truly great!
Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I'm all about the balls. These balls were Aromatic and slightly spicy - I can't wait to put 'em in my mouth again!  

Ditto for the perfectly spiced potato wedges.

The desert (Brownie Sundae) was the only 'meh' part of the meal.
This almond milk ice cream was more ice than cream, and not particularly tasty. Was the brownie 'raw'? It had that kind of texture. I prefer a more baked and crusty take.

Nevertheless I'll totally let that go. I really really like this place. 
Awesome vibe. Seriously good food. Reasonable prices. 
I'll just try a different desert next time."}

I am a big fan of Thai (Pad Thai specifically) and while I've found a few good places, I haven't found anything which I return to on a normal basis.

This place is small, located on East Fremont street in the vicinity of Commonwealth.  Wait was 60 min for a party of 3, but the cool thing is they send you a text with a website to track your place in line, so my party was able to venture off to other places and let the hour fly by.

Le Thai has a very downtown feel which is different from other Vegas establishments, the small kitchen is right off the dining area and they have an outdoor section.  The menu is pretty simple and I'd say most if not all of the items were under $15.

I had a spring roll and Pad Thai w/ Chicken and it was a very reasonable portion!  The noodles had a bit of spice for ordering mild, but I welcomed it.  For the price and quality of food I felt this place blew Lotus of Siam out of the water and will now become my "go to" Thai place."}

Located on Fremont (eastside). We showed up on one of those 110 degree summer days and were sat outside where the mist fans were. (Humid hotspot) Luckily I'm used to the humid weather being from TN but I can see where it might be an issue for some.
We showed up for an early dinner and were seated immediately.

Food:
 I like a kick with my thai food and when it comes to Thai food I see restaurants rate their spiciness level on two scales. People who know Thai spice and people who don't. This is definitely a place that uses the level for people that don't. We ordered a dish with a heat level of "3" which I believe was "hot" but it honestly wasnt bad at all.

As far as the overall food discussion goes - this is one of the best thai places I've been to that is able to cater to both those who love thai good and those that are just trying it for the first time.

We ordered some Thai style wings and these were probably some of the best wings I have ever had. I'd like to think of myself as a wing junkie and these are definitely a must-try.

I got the pad see ewe at a "3" and taste wise it was great. Spice wise I needed to add more to get the kick I wanted.

We also ordered the red curry at a "2" and my girlfriend loved it. - She definitely avoids the spice but she also said she could've kicked it up a bit.

The drinks were strong. The ice melted extremely quick so after about 5mins it was watered down but thats not their fault.

Service:
I've read in previous reviews that there was a common issue with a hostess however our hostess sat us immediately and we didn't have an issue at all with her.

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and our food came out quickly.

Overall:
I will definitely make another trip here when I'm out in Vegas again. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat."}

Parking: Street parking with pay stations.

Wait: I was able to add my name to the wait list via Yelp. The wait was 30 to 45 mins. We got there in 30 mins and our table was ready in 20 mins.

Food: We had Pad Thai chicken, beef, and tofu. We also had the Larb Salad and Crab Rangoon. 

Likes: The best Thai food I ever had. Everything had so much flavor. The Larb Salad I can eat that everyday. The Pad Thai was soooo good!

Dislike: None

Service: The waiter was great but the hostess was amazing she was so friendly. She give us update on our table and even help us pick items on the menu. 

Decor: There's plenty of seats to wait outside but only a bench inside. Its pretty small but they do have a covered patio with plenty of seats for large parties and heating lamps. 

Check: They do accept cards. For four people I spend 80 dollars. 

Overall: I highly recommend this place. Also make sure you add yourself to the wait list via Yelp."}

I love noodles and I eat noodles almost every day. Unfortunately working in Downtown doesn't give me much options in terms of food.

I went to Le Thai once and ordered Awesome Flat Noodle with Shrimp. I really had high hopes because of the great reviews and the $15 price. 

The portion was so so and the noodles were salty. I wanted to like it, but it was just not good enough and OVERPRICED.

3 weeks later, i had my noodle craving and decided to try Le Thai again. I ordered over the phone for take out. The food was ready when I get there and the server was friendly and sweet. 

(So, my rating is solely based on their food.)

I ordered Pad Kee Mow (chicken option, $13) this time. Again, the noodles were so SALTY! I thought my taste buds were too sensitive, so I asked my husband to try the noodles. He thought the noodles were too salty too. The ingredients were nothing to write home about; minced chicken with some veggies. I was so disappointed. If this wasn't a take out, I would have returned it and gave my comment to the chef. 

My husband's Lunch Special Green Curry was ok. But I had such bad experience with their noodles that I just won't go back.  Sorry, it's you. Hopefully you can improve your noodle dishes soon."}

5/11/17. We had dinner here again. Even though I love the green curry and the short rib fried rice, I decided to try the drunken noodles. It did not disappoint.  Kathy was a server. It's our second time with Kathy. She remembered us and what we had the last time. She suggested a heat level for my dish and it was spot on.

We shared an appetizer, short rib fried rice, panang curry, and a noodle dish - and everything was excellent. We polished off everything between four people, but definitely left full and happy. My cousins, who were staying in Vegas the whole week, actually went back that week because this place was so yummy.

* The pork jerky is unique & amazing.  Served with a "pot" of sticky rice, though a lowly appetizer, it is a meal unto itself.  The waterfall beef is just as good, only, it is from a cow...

* The Thai Style Wings (with sriracha ranch) are the best wings downtown.  Period.

* Their Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) is the definition of what a spicy noodle dish should be.  Lots of everything: flavor, protein, noodles, & spice.

* My recent discovery is the garlic fried rice.  I am big on garlic & this dish is HUGE on flavor.

The portions are generous, service at the bar, where I usually sit at lunch or late nights, is always good.  The Thai Iced Coffee is flavorful & strong.

The only issue is their popularity.  On weekends, it can be an hour wait, even at midnight.  

Chances are, on a Friday late night, I'll be at the bar, wolfing down something while the band is on a break.

This place was Cameron's favorite spot. He took everyone here and had his favorite order. My brother has many fond memories here with him so when we were in town for Cameron's funeral many friends thought it would be special to eat here in his honor. After a day of grieving and a funeral we went here, knowing it would probably be a 2-3 hour wait but that it would be worth it. Another friend who was with us told the hostess our situation. She put us on the list and we went to Container Park to kill some time. An hour later a table was ready for us (far shorter than the normal wait). We were so grateful to the staff for making our last minute plans work. That is wonderful service.

The food was equally as wonderful as the service. Best Thai food I've ever had. Each dish was full of flavor and great to split with friends. The drunken noodles were delicious, the fried rice was perfectly cooked, and the soup was full of unique flavor that I loved.

The Pad Thai was okay, nothing to write home about. It oddly didn't come with lime, which I usually see with Pad Thai.

It feels a little seedy, I agree. But if you're a local, you prolly never venture into the strip area. So that said, this is a nice local's spot to get some really authentic Thai with nice staff and a cozy atmosphere. It is not classy per se and you order drinks outside it seemed. But the prices are reasonable and really, it's genuine Thai. So if you're in the area, check it out for a nice dinner with friends"}

The place is small yet comfortable, the hostess was super friendly on the phone and in person AND our server was a very friendly vegan! That last part was my favorite because it feels so rare to find other vegans and I was psyched to have a server fully understand how it feels to order food at a non vegan restaurant. Im sure I come off as needy and overly inquisitive when I go out to eat, so it's a relief to have a vegan take your order. They get it. 

The server started by explaining the vegan options and how a majority of items can be veganized and I was so excited! I ordered the pad see ew with mixed veggies and steamed tofu - spicy level 2 out of 5 - and their spin off of a Thai Julip (can't remember the name but it was amazing)

For a 2, my pad see ew tasted more like a 0.. but the flavor was great! I never thought to inspect my food because, I mean, a vegan took my order so it will be totally vegan right? Low and behold, I find little bits of scrambled EGG in it after having eaten several bites. I was crushed. 

After bringing it to the waiters attention, he was very upset to have let something like that happen and asked if he could have the cook remake the dish but at that point my appetite was gone. He took the dish off the bill and gave us a discount, as well as being very apologetic about the mistake. 

By the time I got home, my stomach had turned and I was so sick my boyfriend called the restaurant. Neither of us expected that little bit of egg to cause me so much grief but I guess after not eating it for such a long time, my stomach was NOT cool with it. Management totally took care of this situation over the phone and I am really looking forward to giving Le Thai another chance.

It sucks for this to happen but I'm not going to give them a shitty review for making one error. We are human and at the end of the day, humans make errors."}

Unusual but good. Under $10 with tips and including a drink so quite a good deal."}

Service - They sat us at a counter right next to the kitchen. Every time someone walked in or yelled at the chef, we were in the middle of it. It was a little annoying. The staff was friendly, but it was slow.

It will even let you check your position in line and alert you when you should head over and check in. Le Thai isn't huge but they do have a small bar area with seating as well as a few tables outside in front with heat lamps. The people watching on Fremont is fun and will instantly put you in a good mood. 

The drunken noodles with ground pork were delicious but the 3 color curry with beef was the best curry I've ever had. They combine the yellow, green, and red curry and the flavor is off the chain. The spice scale ranges from 1-5 with 2 being the default. We stuck with a 2 and it was the perfect blend of spice and flavor. My fiancée and I shared but I totally ate most of his curry. Poor guy didn't stand a chance. Portions were large and the prices were reasonable especially for Fremont Street. This will definitely be a return spot the next time we're in Vegas.

So it was humid too. It was really stuffy in the area, plus all the hot plates goin out and only 2-3 tables open so it was busy. I did not want my family to be eating in that type of environment.

One of our party members knows people that work there so that helped. I was starving too so I'm glad we got in earlier.

Let's see if I remember everything we got: pork jerky, thai chicken wings, pad thai, pad see ew, three color curry, fried rice, drinks. Lots of yummy stuff that was being passed about. My favorite was the pork jerky with the chicken wings coming in second. I don't eat noddles or rice, so nibbling the meat out of those dishes does not really give me a good idea of the dishes, though I remember lots of flavor; I must've been grabbing all the good meat pieces.

I think we could've gone a little spicier for our food but the level 3 spiciness wasn't bad.

Atmosphere was good too. Cute little place.

Shout out to the awesome chef Mike for sending us amazing food! Our server (Dean? I think. Tall guy.) was awesome too and very friendly/attentive. We ordered way too much food for our party of 5 and gave the leftovers to the bouncer at Commonwealth. Good night overall. I would like to go back next time I'm in town."}

I ordered Crab Rangoon, Sriracha Wings (extra crispy), 3 Curry and Short Rib Fried Rice. This was my first time ordering Thai curry and it was a bit sweet to my liking. Nothing special about the Rangoon or wings but both were good. I would, however, go back to order the fried rice again. The tenderness and meaty bits really made the rice special.

The beer menu was underwhelming, filled with a few overpriced Asian beers, Stella, and PBR. Fresh from a weekend in the mountains, we were ready to imbibe, but we ended up not ordering any drinks.

They do have a lunch menu that runs every day (except Sunday) from 11-3 for $9.95, but the portions are a little bit smaller. I would also check the receipt carefully as they tried to overcharge us for adding both beef and shrimp to the pad kee mao.

I do like that they offered brown rice without an additional charge, and the food was decent, but nothing I would go out of my way for.

Parking: metered around the corner

UPDATE: Response to owner's comment below. That's a lot of math for a simple meal, of which was not explained by the server when we ordered shrimp and beef. No one asked which is a "main" and which is an "add on.""}

Aside from his comment, this place is legit in terms of food, but not legit for the wait time. So you can call in and put your name on the wait list and they call you or use the NoWait app. I was told and texted 15 min wait, but ended up waiting 30 minutes before I headed over to the restaurant to make sure we weren't being shafted.  Word of advice...we showed up and there were at least 4 open seats for a party of 2....big fail Le Thai.  The chick at the front needs to get on top of it when it comes to texting parties when tables open up. We probably didn't need to wait at all, but we trusted they were going to text us.  Okay, so lesson learned there.  

Onto the food, this is what gives them the 4 stars.  We ordered:

1. Pork jerky with sticky rice and waterfall sauce: Fried pork that is moist (not like jerky) that is sweet/salty with a citrus dipping (waterfall) sauce, I mean this is close to perfection.  I can probably eat this as a meal by itself!

2. Thai wings with sriracha ranch: fish saucy in taste with a hint of sweetness, fried to a dark brown color...the flavor is so intense inside these wings and outside that it definitely does not need the sriracha ranch.  I ate the wings without the sauce and it was amazing, my favorite dish by far! I was upset my fiance didn't sacrifice and give me part of his share of wings.

3. Short rib fried rice: this dish may have been over hyped by past reviews, while good, not amazing that I would pay $13 for fried rice again.  It was good fried rice, but maybe a little overly sweet because of the short rib pieces.  It didn't end up being spicy enough to balance out the flavor of the short rib.

I will admit I was biased against this place, since I figured it was mediocre Thai food meant for tourists...but it was definitely comparable to the other Thai places in Vegas.  A little bit pricier but that comes with the territory."}

The outside of this restaurant is a little too inconspicuous.  I walked by this place twice while looking for it.  There needs to be a little more signage outside.

One of the cool things about this restaurant are the dining options.  There's a walk-up window for people who want to get take out, or want to sit outside and do a little people watching while they're eating or just waiting for their order to be ready.  If you decide to eat inside the restaurant, you have the choice to sit indoors in an area right between the bar and the kitchen, or continue walking further into an outdoor area.  The waitresses here are extremely friendly.

I forgot the name of the item I ordered, but it was really good.  It was tofu and vegetables.  They asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-5, and I said 4.  The waitress said "Are you sure?  That's pretty spicy.  Once it's made, we can't change it."  I assured her I could handle it.  I was able to get through my meal, but not without having to blow my nose a bunch of times because the spice level had my sinuses going.  My eyes were tearing up and my ears were on fire, but it was worth it.  I think I paid $11 for my food, which is a good deal.  The portions are quite large. 

I'm always on the lookout for good Thai restaurants, and this is definitely a good one.  If you're in this part of town and looking for a nice place to eat lunch or dinner, or if you just want hassle-free take out, this is the place for you."}

The cocktail menu is underwhelming. But the booze is decently prized at happy hour. The food here is as good as your order. The authenticity...I'm not certain about, as I've only enjoyed their most Americanized dishes like the Pad Thai, Panang, and happy hour Chicken Wings. Is it the best Thai restaurant in Vegas? Not even close; it maybe slips into the top 10. But is it the most fun? Most definitely. Regardless of how average this place may be (a surprise given it's awesome Vegas pedigree). I give it four stars for experience and how "somehow" they make a technically average plate of noodles taste like nectar and ambrosia."}

Onto the food: The wings are to die for. Seriously, so good. You will not be disappointed. I had the Pad Thai with a level 3 on the 1-5 scale of heat. Again, very good. Would recommend to anyone. Something like $3 canned beers which is a nice change from staying on the strip.

I saw someone comment on the music being too "BET", maybe whoever is working controls the music but the mix that was on while we were there was mumford and sons, and some other indie music.

 pad thai - very unusual, tasted okay, looked like a Vietnamese goi (salad)

3 kind curry - this one was pretty good, but really.. how can you mess up curry...

thai beef ball noodle soup - very little soup, soup was very light and bland which isn't supposed to be for this kind of soup, beef slices were over cooked, and way too overpriced. Average price of pho even in sf is like $8.. this bowl was like $11.

Tom yum Ca - something like that.... it's the Tom yum with coconut milk and chicken. Tell me why it tastes like they used vinegar to make it sour when they're supposed to used something like tamarind. Tasted like drinking vinegar ....

Definitely did not like their food. Came here because of the good reviews but was very disappointmented. You will be better off somewhere else"}

I personally enjoy any opportunity to find my way downtown and more importantly to try new eateries.  Le Thai has been on my list for a while.

Enthusiastic and hungry we approached the hostess stand only to be told there was a 60-minute wait *insert pouty face here*. No problem, we killed time next door until our seats were ready.

I must have looked unusually disappointed or totally starving because not even 15 minutes later we were being paged that our seats were ready! SCORE!

Ambiance can be best described as a hole-in-the-wall reminiscent of most restaurants in NYC (or Chicago).  It's cool without being smug about it.  

Most importantly the food: excellent portion sizes, bold flavors, spice level was right on point. Their spice chart is 1-4 and we went with 2's all across the board. My friend was sweating, my nose was running but man oh man was it worth it. 

I can recall Le Thai not taking reservations in the past, but since they do currently, I highly recommend taking that extra step in securing your seating. The hostess took pity on us THIS time, but to ensure you are seated in a reasonable fashion, make a res.

Le Thai is something that should be on your list of "to try"."}

If your a local and want AMAZING Thai food you go to Lucki Thai..... if your downtown and want ok Thai food you go here....Because  it is located in downtown Las Vegas.... which is the worst part of town!  You encounter pan handlers and the basic trash of Vegas as you go to the front door. So strike one...the restaurant is tiny (maybe 15 seats inside) and not terribly clean even in time trash can in the ladies room there is graffiti.  Maybe that is their "motif" who knows....Then let's talk about the patio, which they call the "beer garden" Well it was an outdoor space they "enclosed" so when their neighbor has a band your in the middle of their noise.... so the patio is so loud you can't hear one another.  Strike 2. Then we waited for 55 minutes to eat here....are you kidding me?  So when we got to the hostess she told us the wait time and said you could walk and she would text or call us and said there is a cool bar around the corner and sent our party to a bar 4 blocks away in the wrong direction.  I know Downtown and it's seedy at best.  I told our friends that was a bad idea to walk that far away especially at night in the dark. So we waited at another spot two doors down.  So the hostess was to call or text us when our table was ready. Well thought it was about time so we walked back and when it did we were told that they sent us the message 10 minutes  ago and we did not respond and our table had been given away. If we had not been with friends I WOULD NEVER have waited for this dump in the first place.  Strike 3!   

I would have given them a 1 star but the wait staff (not the hostess) were very nice and the food was fast and fairly well done.  So we had pad Thai, which the noodles were light and the sauce was nice.  Then the beef fried rice (I tasted the egg before realizing they ordered beef fried rice and I don't eat beef) and the flavor was good.  Then we had the Tom yum soup which was light and well seasoned  and finally the curry which had good flavors but not very spicy.  The food is overly salty as we had to drink water all night to compensate for the salt.  

But was it so special  that I would go back.  NO actually never is a better statement.  Drive down Spring Mountain and pick any Thai restaurant and you could have the same meal without the riff raff of the Vegas strip.  And to top it off as we went to get our car the police stopped traffic in front of us and took a man into custody in the middle of the street.  It is not the Wynn kids... way too seedy for me."}

Ordering something at a level two means it's more spicy than you expect. 
Service was lack there of. You order a drink and 20 mins later you have to ask for it again (don't think it was that busy). Our waiter made sure we got what we asked for the second time around. Also it took a longtime for someone to take our food  order. 
Seriously fix the bathroom locks. I kept opening and closing the bathroom to make sure they locked. Finally I gave up  thinking that maybe I'm crazy and it always opens from the inside and got walked in on. Since the place is relatively small it made for an awkward situation . 
They were however able to split the check onto two credit plus take cash. That was helpful."}

We went in and we're told there was about a 15 minute wait. There were tables open, but we guess they didn't want to back the kitchen up. Hostess was nice, but never acknowleged why there was a wait. 
So we waited outside with others that said it was great and worth the wait. 

Once seated the waitress was extremely helpful describing the dishes we were unsure of... 

We ordered the Tom Yum soup & Vegetable Stir Fry. 
The Tom Yum spicy factor was a 2 out of 5.. still pretty hot.. Flavor was incredible. of hot & sour with lots of mushrooms, tomatoes & chicken. 

Vegetable Stir Fry with Beef was cooked perfectly, tender vegetables and plenty of meat served on your choice of white or brown rice. 

The lunch specials included a drink for $8.95, which is a great deal. 

Downtown is really getting a variety of great restaurants! This Thai restaurant is truly a match against others in the valley!"}

They seated us at the edge of the room where the entire wall is partially open to the bitter cold outside (so your head is warm, but your legs are freezing). Although there were heat lamps, the walls were just counter-intuitive. 
I ordered the vegan curry, which I was very excited to see on the menu, AND with an option of chicken, beef, pork, or tofu. Now of course, I assumed this would be VEGAN, FAUX chicken/beef/pork, because why in the world would someone offer REAL MEAT with VEGAN curry?? Especially since I explicitly told the waitress that I didn't eat meat. So I ordered the vegan curry- chicken. Although my friend didn't like it, I thought the curry tasted fine.. until I started chewing on the meat which tasted like blood/iron and sinew so I asked the waitress who, only AFTER I ordered and tried it, let me know that it's NOT vegan. All four of us at the table were completely dumbfounded as to why anyone would offer "Vegan Curry" on the menu to have non-vegan meat in it?? And to not even be clear about that?? And when the waitress was told that the particular customer doesn't eat meat?? IMAGINE THAT. I don't get disturbed easily, but I was very disturbed after biting into flesh after being vegetarian for 7 years. That was $13 down the drain for me.
I'm grudgingly giving 3 stars because my friends did enjoy their beef fried rice, and maybe the waitress had a long day. But all in all, what a ridiculously counter-intuitive place."}

You can eat out back open air too - very misty- but twas hot so we ate inside. I think they DJ music at night there too- very happening.Traditional pad Thai, chick skewers, pork jerky lots more... veggie and other healthy tidbit as well. I cant wait to try some more. Yum.

Located on the Fremont Street experiance the great Buddah has blessed us and enlightened our taste buds with this fine establishment. I'm a huge Thai food fan and not all places measure up to my standards, but Le Thai exceded my standards.

Now because the restaurant is small you may have a wait, but the host will page your cell phone when you table is ready. Le Thai's menu is small but everything is flavorful and delicious. The flavor explosion will melt your mind and taste buds. You'll not be disappointed in the array of thai spices used to create your food. Now Frank ordered many items to sample from but it's started off with a glass of there Thai Ice Tea. A sweet tasting refreshing beverage the will satisfy your thirst. 

Waterfall Beef is awesome an amazing way to start your meal . The Thai "beef" Salad exceeded my expectations with all the flavors that came out of it. If you've always wondered what the perfect salad was then order this one. Now for your main items the short rib rice ushered me into the new wave of rice dishes. The short rib meat added a sweet flavoring to fried rice like I've never experience before and I loved it. And let's not forget about the Pad Thai noodle dish, because it was off the flavor chart. A perfect 10 for Pad Thai dishes and it shows. This place may be small but it's culinary dishes give it a huge restaurant presence in Vegas. I can't wait to eat here again.

My first visit was on 04/12/2013 and I was expecting a lot since I read all the raving reviews on Yelp and fortunately, it delivered. We tried their Chicken Pad Thai, 3 Color Curry, and (Minced) Pork Pad Kee Mow. 

The Pad Thai was honestly not my favorite preparation of this classic dish, but it was still tasty. The 3 Color Curry was so much fun! It's "Le Thai's special blend of red, yellow and green curry and all its vegetables" which includes Bamboo shoot, bell pepper, Thai basil, potato, onion, and carrots in coconut milk. The flavor was obviously unique and well done. I don't care for potatoes in my curry, so next time, I'll stick with my favorite, red curry. Now, the Pad Kee Mow was out of this world. Top 10 favorite dish of all time (I don't have an official Top 10 list, but if I did, it would be on there somewhere). I mean, SOO DELICIOUS! I'm not even a big Pad Kee Mow fan and have never been, so this changed my life.

On my second visit (04/21/2013) with friends, we tried the Short Rib Fried Rice (Pulled beef from short rib stir-fried with waterfall sauce, egg, garlic, yellow and green onion, topped with cilantro) and of course, I ordered the Pork Pad Kee Mow again, Thai Salad (Grilled beef or chicken with red and green onion, tomato and cilantro mixed with lime juice and Thai chili), and Green Curry. This trip solidified my love for the place and its Pad Kee Mow. Perfection in a bowl. The salad was okay, not something for me in the flavor department.

The restaurant itself is cool, the outside/inside dining is cozy (but loud on weekend nights). Service is just okay. Nothing amazing, but not horrible. The wonderful food more than makes up for it. Honestly, I can't think about anything else but that delicious Pork Pad Kee Mow. Eat it. Oh, and spice levels aren't playing around. I wish I could remember what level I ordered because I definitely need to take it down a notch. I sweated...and it wasn't because of the weather."}

Today I had a late afternoon lunch, and ordered the happy hour chicken skewers. The waitress warned me that two sticks  would be filling , but for six dollars I couldn't imagine them being that big. 

I must say that I was wrong. The happy hour appetizer chicken skewers would be equivalent to two full-size chicken breasts. It came with a small cucumber salad and peanut satay dressing. It was really delicious. I couldn't even finish the appetizer and I was hungry. 

I ordered a beer so I didn't feel like such a Jew, and could give the waitress a big tip.

I am seriously full with a happy belly."}

Myself and my hubby are Vegan - most of our friends aren't. We go here because they cater to us both! We usually go for Awesome Noodles, Thai fried rice and Massamam curry. All delicious. Large portions. Delicious is an under statement. We also often get a cucumber salad - a refreshing side dish. OH! And if you go in the evening? Enjoy the spicy peanuts. Seriously delicious and flavorful!!

Service
Everyone here from host to the waiters and waitresses, bar staff and manager are all super friendly and professional. They are usually slammed in the evening but the service remains amazing none the less. I am surprised they keep smiles on their faces despite the constant rush of patrons in and out, We always give a generous tip to reflect their excellent service!

Wait Time
Be prepared to wait if you come later in the evening. You can download the "no wait" app to add yourself to the list on a busy evening. 

Location
Fremont is a bustling and hip area of vegas - just far enough from the Fremont experience to avoid the madness but close enough to benefit from the busy ambience. And if you have to wait for a table, there are tons of bars in close proximity to grab a drink in. 

10/10 for everything! We love Le Thai!!"}

The food was delicious! We ordered a variety of food and everything was top notch. I typically go for the pad see ewe but opted instead for the awesome noodles with pork. Its the savory cousin to PSE and didn't disappoint, neither did the chicken satay or the curry. Their spice level for me was spot on. I ordered a 3 and it felt appropriately like a 3, not too spicy with just the right amount of kick.
Also another dish that is unique to Le Thai is their short rib fried rice. It was absolutely tasty.
The atmosphere here is very nice and fits well with that of other restaurants/bars in the downtown area. Their outdoor seating was pleasant with misters that mist intermittently. I will most definitely be back to Le Thai"}

I ordered the fried rice and was VERY disappointed as the menu said "combination fried rice $11 add shrimp $13" so I thought that meant chicken, pork, and shrimp so I ordered the $13 one. Nope. Just shrimp. No chicken or other meats. Maybe it was just me but I found that very misleading. The portion was about half of what an authentic Thai restaurant would give you.
I ordered the spring rolls which were fine, but tasted exactly like Panda Express eggrolls. 
I also got the Thai iced tea which was great but a little more expensive than other places.

I spent $27 on small portioned food. The flavor is good, nothing incredible, but I wouldn't come back. This spot is more "trendy" than authentic. Pass."}

We brought this to the servers attention and he never said sorry or attempted to remake our order or anything. He dropped the bill off and we payed. As we were walking out I noticed one of the owners outside and told her about how disappointed we were in how they reacted to our problem aNd her response was "I'm not he owner just a manger" **lies...

The place is very small and even their covered patio wasn't much bigger but where small in size, this place is huge on flavor. It was Saturday night, before six p.m. and there was an hour wait for a table because of reservations. We managed to get a seat at the 'bar' which is a small counter on the patio where there is side by side seating. The food we ordered was awesome and they had a very nice selection of imported beer. I love Singha, the more commonly available Thai beer, but I tried the Lucky Buddha beer from China, which comes in a nice Buddha shaped bottle. It was actually good beer but since I am not a frequent beer drinker, it might have been more to my taste than to others. In any event, I can hardly wait to go back again and try some of the other dishes on the menu. I will make a reservation well in advance this time.

The only reason I gave less than five stars is the wait time for a rez but solve that my making one next time."}

I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, I didn't want to hype it up before I even taste the food. I truly believe that Lotus of Siam is the best Thai food in the country, the whole entire United States of America, that's how good Lotus of Siam is, very hard to compete. 

It's a cute little spot, very small, the restaurant, kitchen & bar is literally like the size of my bedroom. They have a front patio area and a back patio area, they sat us at the side bar in the back, I didn't realize it was open air, it was over 100 degrees outside so they had the misters going, which is great to cool us down but then we're moist, the food is moist, my glasses got fogged up, it was a hot mess back there.

Then the club next door started tuning their instruments, and it got louder, and louder, to the point we couldn't even hear each other talk anymore. 

Let's talk about the food, that's why we're here in the first place. The shrimp pad thai was good, was it the best? No, sadly it wasn't. The beef salad was alright, needed a lot of lime juice. We gave it a try and it just wasn't our kind of place, sorry Lotus is still the best of the best."}

Really..the only downside to this place is that it's rather small and so there's almost always a sizable wait at peak times. I like the service, the decor is not out of this world but always makes me comfortable and the food is solid. The menu is short and sweet and a large number of dishes can be made vegetarian. We like their spring rolls, tom yum soup, ginger fried rice, massaman curry, basil noodles and awesome noodles. 

The drinks menu is pretty solid with some interesting cocktail concoctions and Asian beer options. I'm a happy camper that Le Thai is here in Vegas and adding to the downtown scene!"}

Pro tip: Go on Yelp about an hour or more before dining it to put your name on the wait list. Otherwise, if you plan on dining here expect to wait

Spice Levels: The spicy-ness here ranges between 1-5. We were told 3 was spicy so that's what we got and it really wasn't spicy at all (my family however has a pretty high tolerance for spice)

Crispy Spring Rolls: yum yum yum, can't go wrong with fried spring rolls!

Tom Yum Soup: Delicious!! To be honest, I don't think I've ever had bad Tom Yum soup, but this soup reached by expectations.

Awesome Flat Noodles: verrrryyy good. Noodles were perfectly cooked and the flavors blended really well.

Spicy Eggplant: Didn't come with enough eggplants but the eggplant it did come with were very flavorful and cooked well."}

If you are not into spice, this is a great choice since they only prepare it mild. The beef was tender, and it came served with delicious sticky rice.  The Thaijito cocktail was amazing!

Since I left in 2011, I haven't seen the progress.  So, on a recent trip, I decided to check it out for myself to see what was going on.  I told The Better Half to save her appetite so we could sample some food in the area.  After walking around a bit, we decided to check out this joint.  We ordered:

Pad Thai Tofu, $13
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w#2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ#jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ

The food came out shortly after we ordered it and we dug into our dishes.  They were very good!  I had the Pad Thai and it had the right combination of sweet and spicy flavors...and they cooked the Tofu just how I ordered it, a little crispy.  Believe it or not, many Thai restaurants can't get that right.  The Better Half enjoyed her Pad See Ew.

Our server and the hostess who sat us were very friendly and offered warm smiles despite being very busy with many demanding customers.

The only small complaints I have is that the seating in the front room is kind of tight.  We could easily hear the conversations of the tables next to us and the elbow room was less than ideal.  I felt like we had to whisper so that they couldn't hear our conversation.  Also, parking is a bit of a challenge.  You'll have to park at a nearby parking garage or casino and walk here....which isn't too much of a problem if this area is your destination for the evening.

Overall, great restaurant.  Glad to see them busy and they appear to be thriving.

Be prepared to pay almost twice what you would at most casual Thai restaurants and be aware that they have a very limited menu, which you can see on the web at www.lethaivegas.com

The food comes out quick and very hot. The taste was fantastic. The spice levels are 1-5 and according to my wife, the 2 was hotter than she was accustomed to so if you have any doubts, go low. I thought the level 5 was just right for those of us who really like it hot.

We will definitely return to Le Thai.

Edit: We are back for dinner a day later at ten minutes until five and no wait at all. 



Service both days has been great. The food is still fantastic. Don't miss this if you're in Vegas. Even if you don't think you'd like Thai food you should take a chance; I doubt you'll regret it."}

All jokes aside, this place is awesome. The noms are excellent, my favorite being the yellow curry chicken with rice. I think $13 is more than fair for the quality and amount you receive. I've tried the short rib rice too which was great but their curry is just my favorite, I'm looking forward to trying the 3 curry mix next time.

All of the employees here are great and so nice, I've always had excellent service! I really enjoy the outdoor seats too, I always get put in the same table, it must be where they put the wierdys, I accept this

I hold off on 5 stars because I really wish they stayed open later than 11, and sometimes the wait to be seated can take longer than told even with reserving the spot via yelp. But the wait is always MORE than worth it."}

There's something so authentic about this tiny lil' joint. From the decor to the food, I could swear I was invited to eat at someone's home. What we ordered:

- Spring Rolls - Light and crispy. The sweet chili sauce was the perfect accompaniment

- Tom Ka Soup with Tofu - By far the best Tom Ka I've had. The coconut was a nice cooling factor against the heat of the spice and the freshness of the lemongrass. Perfection!

- Awesome Noodles - Perfect name for the perfect noodle dish. I ordered it with chicken and with an over medium egg on top. This is a must try!

- Fried Bananas - Pretty standard. It was good, but I don't think you could really mess this up. It was light and crispy. Only thing I would've changed is if it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

Le Thai is a must try!"}

Another hostess comes and doesn't even acknowledge our presence and takes the other party of 3 to be seated right away. When my coworker let this young lady POLITELY know we were before the other group she responded by saying that she was going to seat them first.

Best of both worlds. Great NY style thin crust Pizza and Hot every slice, and table service for your drinks. I just wish they would make 14" version of this Pizza!

While I was aware they have an extensive menu, it was such a pleasant evening we wanted to eat outside.  Pizza Rock has a nice outdoor dining area adjacent to an ordering window that faces the alley at The Grand in downtown off 3rd street.  
   
We went up to the window to order, but since we weren't 100% sure on what we wanted to order we went just inside the entryway to place our orders, since it's a bit quieter and we could here the servers/cooks better.  They had several varieties of pizzas to choose from all ready to eat similar to other pizza-by-the-slice restaurants.  I ordered 2 pepperoni slices, my wife got a pepperoni and a cheese slice, and the kids each got a slice of pepperoni.  

The prices were reasonable my wife's and my 4 slices total and 2 sodas came to $22 which was about what I had planned on spending for a meal for 2.  The slices are very large, larger then other slices I've had from any other pizza-by-the-slice restaurant.  It was just enough to be a full meal without being too much.  The servers were very friendly and helpful too - quick and efficient.  

We ate out in the aforementioned outdoor dining area, and had a great time together.  The location was fun, with many people coming and going, and the music from the Fremont Experience was keeping us rocking in our seats.  The pizza was hot and tasty.  I give the pizza 3 out of 5 stars, and the atmosphere, locale, and staff the 4th star.  

I'm more partial to a New York style crust, a slightly thicker than cracker crust.  Pizza Rock was the extra thin crust style which is not my personal favorite.  The cheese was good, but average and the pepperonis flavorful but lacking any real oomph.  The best part for me was the sauce, which was a very light, and not overly tomato-ish which I find Sbarro's sauce to be.  Not my personal favorite, but quite good overall. 

I would go back for slices at Pizza Rock, as we all had a blast and the pizza was good."}

So we had the meatballs, fried green beans, and personal pizzas. That was way more than enough food for the two of us and way cheaper than just getting one big pizza to share.  Would definitely eat here again and again.

July 10, 2018, A review update. I had a friend come out to Vegas in January on business and she booked dinner here for 20 people due to my recommendation. She said it could not have been more awful. The waiter was inattentive. The green beans were soggy and limp, meatballs were good, pizza was terrible. I felt so bad that they had such a horrible experience, everyone in her group was complaining and said they should have eaten elsewhere. Well I have learned not to recommend anything to anybody ever again. I was so sorry to hear they had a terrible dinner."}

It is okay.  For a food court lobster roll, it is as good as one would expect, or maybe slightly better.

I visit Planet Hollywood a few times a year for work and/or fun.  I have stopped by Lobster Me for a hot lobster roll twice.  Service was fine.  The roll is a little small.  It is really more of a big snack versus a meal, but that is fair considering the price of lobster.

I chose the lobster fish and chips with Cajun fries that comes with a complimentary coleslaw. YUMMY IN MY TUMMY. My friends were eating their chilli dogs and watching  me with envy. I devoured my meal. The lobster was tender not overcooked, the fries lightly seasoned to perfection and the coleslaw was sweet and cream just the way I liked it. My only complaint if the portion size was small. I know lobster is expensive but they could give your more fries and more slaw bump it up from 13 to 15. I was still a bit hungry afterwards. I regret not trying their lobster rolls they have hot and cold ones. They look like the real deal and Ronnie told me it's a full lobster in every roll."}

So of course we had to come try pizza. However being vegan this limits my choices a bit. 
I got the only vegan pizza option on the menu...it was a sad disappointment. The pizza was clearly made by people that believe vegans have no taste buds. 
The "marinara" is just that...charred crust (which I don't mind) and canned tomatoes with a sprinkle of dried oregano and 5 roasted garlic cloves. I'm sorry but vegan doesn't have to be flavorless. And since when do we just put canned tomatoes on pie? They just taste canned...a few spices go a long way."}

You absolutely must try this place if you like pizza, calzones, traditional Italian food, salads, burgers, or sandwiches.  Our group tried almost all of those categories and nobody was disappointed!

Positives
1) This location is right downtown off 3rd street and very close to Fremont Street.  Outdoor dining options available and the main dining room inside is expansive with a nice bar near the rear.  TVs line every wall and you could watch essentially any sporting event during your visit.
2) Menu is incredible and diverse!  I highly recommend the Truffle Italian Fries, Fried Green Beans, Garlic Bread, and Calamari Fritti for your appetizers, all were exceptional!
3) Pizza menu is epic and wide ranging.  The Margherita Pizza is an absolute MUST!  Their menu says they only make 73 of these a day; don't pass up the opportunity to try it.  We also had "The Butcher" pizza which was essentially a meat lover style pizza that was fantastic, and we had a "Detroit Red Top", can't miss with either!  This location also has a place up front to buy pizza by the slice!  Awesome...
4) Their sandwiches were also great; our party had a meatball sub and Italian trio sub.  No complaints here!
5) A wide selection of draft beers and cocktail menu.

Negatives
1) Parking is limited and will almost certainly require parking at a nearby casino if you cannot find street or adjacent parking.  Plan ahead and drop off your party and have the driver find parking.
2) For Pizza the pricing is a tad on the high side but I think well worth it.  Just know going in that it is not going to be lower end pricing."}

Pizzas- across the board, amazing!  Wished my appetite was endless to try all of the food!
Desserts- didn't quite make it to those, but will next time!
Entertainment vibe is pretty chill, little loud depending on the time of day, very family/kid friendly. (Check out the DJ booth) my kids got a private peek! And they loved it.
Parking- is not hard, many options. I parked and Ballys, and validated in the casino.

Ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. 

Lobster is good bc nature made a bug stuffed with delicious meat, which makes it even more egregious that it couldn't save the sad, soupy Mac and cheese it topped. An insult to the lobster that gave its life for this!

Maybe it was an off day but the sauce was thin and gritty bc the cheese wasn't fully incorporated into the sauce, nor was there adequate roux, if at all, to start the sauce. 

The result was a mass of bland noodles with the occasional sad speck of coagulated cheese stuff, topped with crunchies and lobster meat. All the flavor ended up in the soup at the bottom of the container. 

For $16, you can do better elsewhere.

Service isn't the greatest, either. It seems like the staff was too busy with what they were doing to be personable or upbeat."}

My husband & I have been here several times and have had many of the pizzas which are usually good. Got the Margarita pizza today. It was absolutely terrible! When picking up a slice everything on it fell off and the crust was like mush. Definitely  not how it was suppose to be. We sent it back (before I got a picture) and waited for a new one. After 20-25 minutes we were still waiting for our pizza.... getting a little mad it was taking so long. Obviously we weren't a priority. We finally decided to cancel the order. While canceling we were told our pizza went to another table & they were complaining  about it too. WTF! The bartender took the pizza off the bill & gave us a free drink so no problems with his service but really doesn't help with the poor quality & inability to correct it. We left & ate elsewhere. 

We used to recommend Pizza Rock to everyone and bring friends & family here when they visit from out of town. That won't happen anymore. Not sure if we will return."}

Today, I finally answered the call.

Back in December, I was fortunate enough to win a $10 credit for Lobster ME at a Yelp event (see Yelp Helps: NPO-Yeah! for more info). This made any expenditure at this place a much more tolerable option, although I still anticipated having to shell out something for a Strip location that happened to serve the arguably already overpriced treat known as lobster.

I pretty much went straight to the Original "Maine Style" lobster roll. I limited myself to the medium size at $17, rather than go for the large size at $23, the difference being $7 vs. $13 out of pocket for me. This is described as Maine lobster with a touch of mayo, lemon, and a secret spice blend. I didn't taste too much mayo and I am reasonably sure that there's turmeric in the spice mix, but I can't be too sure beyond that.

This roll is pretty good! I definitely enjoyed the buttery, soft roll that still had a nice crunch, the ample chunks of lobster meat and claw, and the aforementioned mayo and spices. I probably would have given them four stars on the spot, but during the drive home I realized that it just didn't strike a memorable enough chord with me. Flavor aside, I'm pretty sure I'm barely over half full from that "medium' roll, if that.

Overall, I can see this being a convenient luxury food option for somebody with money to burn or for a tourist who feels trapped in Planet Hollywood / the Miracle Mile Shops, but I just wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. There's just so many great places around Vegas that aren't so pricey."}

I called to make reservations because we were coming with 5 adults and 2 babies in strollers.  We knew the strollers are sometimes an issue due to spacing of the tables, which was the main reason we called ahead.  The girl I spoke with put me on hold to check with someone about space for strollers and confirmed that they had a table for us that would have more than enough room.  

Fast forward to our reservation time.  I check in at 6:25 for our 6:30 reservation and was told it would just be a minute.  We wait and wait and wait.  15 min has gone by, and we see other people walk in and get seated right away.  I go up to ask how much longer our wait would be and the girl who I originally checked in with asks - "do you have a reservation?"  Are you kidding?! I already told you we did 15 min ago!  We have been sitting and waiting this whole time right in front of you!  I tell her - yes, 5 adults and 2 strollers for a 6:30 reservation.  She says there's no tables that can accommodate strollers, her reservations just says 5 adults and 2 babies.  What?!  Apparently she assumed they would be sitting in high chairs not strollers.  I explained that we called ahead specifically about the strollers.  Instead of apologizing for the mixup, she rudely tries to show me her iPad to prove she's right and her reservation doesn't specify strollers.  I believe you, the person taking the reservation screwed up...fine! But what are you going to do to make this right? By now we have been waiting 20 min past our reservation.

She tells us we can sit at a tall bar top table.  With the strollers?  That doesn't work.  We see multiple long empty tables, but we're told they're reserved for other reservations.  Finally she walks away...presumably she was tired of dealing with us.  So we find who we believe to be the manager and he finally finds us a table.  

Look, I get it.  This probably wasn't the best place to bring 2 babies in strollers. We know that now. But we were visiting from out of town and didn't realize the vibe of this place.  But the fact that we called ahead to make specific reservations, then be treated so rudely by the girl at the front desk with long black curly hair is unacceptable.  I wish I had gotten her name, but I didn't.  The only reason we didn't leave right then and there was it was a Saturday night and we probably wouldn't find another restaurant with a short wait time, and we were hungry! 

Our waiter was just ok service wise.  The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 was because we enjoyed the food.  The artichoke appetizer was delicious, as were the pizzas we got (I believe it was the St Anthony and Stout pizzas).  

Would we come back? Hell no!!  The pizzas were good, the service was HORRENDOUS.  Not worth the trouble in my opinion."}

I have to say without a doubt this is now one of two reasons for me to hit the strip. The service we got from the staff was pleasant and they answered all of our questions. The wife had the grilled cheese and our soon had the Mac and cheese. As mentioned in previous reviews the Mac and cheese isn't out of a box. It was fresh, hot, and they didn't skimp on the lobster. The grilled cheese was warm and plenty gooey with plenty of lobster as well. I went with the regular size lobster roll combo that included fries and a drink. I most say I was a little surprised at the size of the roll for the price, but the amount of lobster in the salad and the claw meat on top more than made up for it. It was so good that I ordered a second roll. 

For me the only negatives is that you share a common area with the bar next door selling those touristy size drinks in those goofy cups. The music that they had on in that bar wasn't something I wanted to listen to. Also the restrooms are a far away and the distance is off putting for us dining with a younger child who needed to use it."}

Let me say, it was extremely underwhelming. The lobster seemed -- literally -- like they were scrapping the bottom of the barrel for lobster pieces. And it was dry, not moist & tender as it should be. I probably should be giving this place one star, not two, but am trying to be generous. And the woman who took my order was nice.

But for $17, I expect good tasting lobster. This was just incredibly meh. And I'd swear there were absolutely no pieces of lobster tail in this sandwich, it all seemed to be from the claws and elsewhere (if that's possible). Which leads me to think, this is one of those places that buys the dregs from restaurants that serve lobster tails and have no use for the other parts. I will never eat here again, I promise."}

I can attest, I've been to Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco many times and it's bona fide pizza heaven.  

Pizza Rock is conveniently located across from the Downtown Grand Hotel. Our server was attentive but not hovering and it was a fun vibe too.  Menus are crafted from album covers for Pete's sake!  We hung out at happy hour which made this an even better deal, I'd have been completely satisfied paying full price.  

Rosemary Garlic Italian Fries and Fried Green Beans were a sold start.  Classic Meatballs were as drool-worthy as they are in Tony's San Francisco spot.  Then the Cal Italia arrived...a blend of cheeses including gorgonzola, prosciutto, a sweet fig preserve and balsamic reduction.  Seriously, I'm salivating thinking about it."}

They were so good, I could not stop eating them and almost made myself sick.  The Honey Pie pizza was incredible, spicy and sweet and crazy good.  For all us vegetarians that watch the world eating hedonistic bacon-y indulgences and wonder where ours might be, this is it - the Honey Pie had all those fatty, salty, sweet, hot, incredibly delicious notes in a vegetarian vehicle.  One of the best things I've every eaten.  I've always loved Tony's fried artichoke appetizer and it's still a favorite.  The fried green beans were delicious, and felt virtuous and healthy compared to everything else we ate on our trip.  Loved them.  Hubby loved the slider and the meatballs and stromboli are always a favorite of his, it's nice to have constants between Tony's restaurants.  My new favorite drink is the Pineapple Fizz - so refreshing and not too sweet, just really drinkable and wonderful.  Honestly the best food we had in Vegas, and by far the most affordable.

It's located in the Miracle Mile shops, which is a great place to shop, eat/drink off the strip, or just people watch. 
The manager, was very nice I'll add, and offered my man and I, a sampling of the New England Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque Soups. The NYCC, was OVER salty. My gosh. A tad too overpowering, for the basic taste that soup can offer. The Lobster Bisque was good, but not comparable to seafood restaurant quality of course. Both were at the right temperature. 
We decided to split a sandwich and chowder fries. The sandwich had about 5 large pieces of lobster chunks on it and the bread was toasted and seasoned. It just didn't have enough sauce, the lobster could have had some flavoring or be butter-dipped and the fries were just okay, with the sauce/dip kind of thrown atop, but mainly coating just a few of them on top. 
We left somewhat bummed, especially at the price and despite the long line, but I did hear the Lobsicle and Lobster Grilled Cheese Melt, are pretty tasty.

You can purchase by the slice or dine in. They have a full menu that offers vegetarian friendly items to the meat lovers delight so you can really please most.

I've been there at different hours of the day from the lunch hour, happy hour, and the late night sober up hour and have received the same great customer service each time. 

The happy hour is AWESOME! The portions of the appetizers on happy hour are the same large size such as the fried green beans (which you have to try). 

Food Favorites: I have yet to have a pizza in all the crust categories that i haven't enjoyed but the fig and prosciutto with balsamic is amazing and a little of the sweeter side. The Brooklyn and Franknitti are great vegetarian options. You can never go wrong with a calzone, they're a little on the bready side but they're quite large. Appetizer wise I HIGHLY  recommend the Fried Green Tomato Caprese Salad (It shows they serve it at the downtwon location online however it used to be only at the GVR location). Calamari Fritti is quit tender and has a light fluffy fried batter and lastly the fried green beans are BOMB!"}

Excellent service. Perfect niche with a few quality options for lobster lovers, like lobster Mac and cheese and lobster on a stick. Prices a little higher, but it is Vegas, and the quality is worth it. Major cravings for lobster rolls are a regular thing now."}

On one of my many weekday business trips to Vegas, where I usually stay at Elara (formerly PH Westgate), I was searching for someplace close to get some dinner to take back to my hotel room (where yes, I would be working, picking up where I left off when I left the client office). While wandering around the Miracle Mile, I found Lobster ME and tried their Original Maine Style lobster roll to go. OMG, so filling and so good. Definitely a nice change from the sandwiches and other quick style food to go. A little pricey at $22, but luckily it came reasonably close to my per diem for dinner. =D"}

We came in 20 mins later and were told they don't start the margherita until you come in which they did not tell us that over the phone. If they informed us, we would have gone straight there.

We paid and we waited another 10 minutes. Unsure if the guy in the Slice House area was making it or if it was being made in the back from Pizza Rock. I heard the guy shout to the other that he asked for the margherita 10 minutes ago. Other guy said he burned the first one and had to start over. Thanks for letting us know (except we had to overhear it to even find out why we've been sitting there for close to 20 minutes extra).

Pizza at $18, small, and with bad service earns them one star!

I don't know who in Italy voted for this but our pizza was wet and soggy. When I picked up my slice the tip drooped & I was hoping I was about to get punked. I really couldn't believe that we were served this pizza. I can't imagine it's meant to be this way & it was also really charred, overwhelming the wettest pizza as a whole. My man said to me that my search has to stop because he can't handle anymore let downs. 

We also had the meatballs & garlic bread which were excellent. Decided on tiramisu as well to get the pizza taste out of our mouths. 

The place itself is a lot of fun with so much personality. It's also very dark which I always love. It had so many manly features like a semi truck! Fun! But it also thought of the ladies with chandeliers & a super cute restroom (I love it when places don't forget about the restrooms). The service was great & the atmosphere was awesome but I still can't get over our soggy pizza. After all this place is called Pizza Rock & our pizza didn't rock at all."}

For a Lobster Roll and combo, which includes fries and drink, was $25.00. 

I ordered the lobster roll with panko or bread crumbs on it. I was expecting chunks of lobster and a couple of claws as stated by other Yelp reviewers. 

My lobster roll consisted of shredded lobster than didn't even fill the ends. It could of used a little more mayo on it, it just seemed lacking a little. The meat was tasty, but for the price, it wasn't quite there. 

I've had some pretty good lobster rolls at other restaurants, this one came up short. My friend had the same sediments as me. He also got the chowder and said it was really runny. 

If the price was less, then what we got for our buck would had been great, but for the price, it needs to stand out more. 

I probably won't be going back, since the price and quantity and quality wasn't worth it to me. 

But I might try the lobster macaroni one of these days there."}

I found a deal on Living Social for $29 for 1 craft beer, 1 appetizer, and 1 pizza to share. It was well worth it!!  The total for this portion of our bill was $54!  

When we walked in, this place had a nice vibe. The music was a great selection and it was the perfect volume.  We were sat near the bar, but asked to move, so we didn't have to sit on bar stool level table and chairs.  They were very accommodating and moved us no problem. 

Of course we all ordered beers.  They have a nice selection of drafts, and an even bigger selection of bottles. 

We ordered the SALUMI & FORMAGGIO BOARD for our appetizer. The menu describes it as - Assorted Salumi & Formaggio, Fig Jam, Spicy Candied Walnuts, Rosemary Focaccia Toast.  It was very good and is a nice bite for 2-4 people. Unfortunately, we were so hungry, I forgot to get a picture of it. :P

Then for the pizza, we decided to get our money's worth of the coupon I had and ordered the biggest pizza we could.  LOL! 
We chose the Romano II. It was divided into three section with three different toppings. All three were delicious!  The pizza was thin and crispy and there were plenty of toppings and cheese. 
Here's how the menu describes it...section 1: Tomato Sauce, Natural Casing Pepperoni, Italian Sausage; section 2: Pesto, Caramelized Onions, Goat Cheese, Roasted Tomatoes, Garlic; section 3: Ricotta, Garlic, Basil, Linguisa, Piquante Peppers
Section 1 was perfect for that typical man "meat lovers" pizza. Section 2 was unique with the sweetness of the Caramelized onions and saltiness of the goat cheese.  Section 3 was my favorite, even though I think they forgot the ricotta. I loved the sweetness of the Piquante Peppers (like a roasted red pepper), and the Linguisa is very similar to their pepperoni. 

During our meal the GM came over and asked us how we were enjoying it and even told us all about the business, from the encouragement of my Aussie friend. 

Would definitely go back and will!!!"}

This place is located in the mall of Planet Hollywood right next to Fat Tuesday's. I walked by this place a couple times during my stay at the Elara, and finally decided to give it a try. The menu was simple.

What I ordered:
Cajun Lobster Roll - HOLY MOLY. This roll was worth the $20 (or maybe it was $17). They gives generous amounts of lobster and the spice is just fantastic. So much flavor bursting in my mouth, and it didn't overpower the lobster. Every bite was much too perfect with the buttery bun it comes on... wow. If you think $20 is too expensive for a roll, please keep in mind that IT IS LOBSTER... in a desert :P
Lobster Salad - Nothing to special about this salad. I wanted something healthy, but still try the lobster here. I ended up eating just the lobster and a few bites of salad, ha. Nothing too special about this one.

Service was good and very friendly. A verity of beverages to choose from. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed :)"}

First off, I will say, I give this place 2 stars vs. 1 since the food was not of poor quality and the service was fine. The value however, was way off. Looking back I have only myself to blame, but I hope my post will dissuade other big hungry guys or perhaps their wife will read and warn them. DO NOT expect a sandwich from this. Despite the fact you are paying more than a filet minion, the sandwich is not a sandwich as many lobster roll joints have come to be known for providing over the past few years, but in fact an old school 5" bread roll. 

Here is where you "Lobster-Lost Me" folks: 

If you were charging $5 to $7 for a 4 to 5 inch old school lobster roll (or even $10 to $12 in Vegas), that would be OK. However, when you charge $27 bucks, you better damn well slap that sucker in a hoagie bun and fill it up as I and every real American man expects it! 

The giant "sandwich" photos at the booth at first glance look like normal sandwich rolls (AKA Hoagie Rolls for our East Coast Friends). Here is where I goofed. If you look closely at one photo, you can see wedges of avocado on the top. If I were smart and not hungry, I would have realized the roll was only slightly larger than these wedges. What these are is in fact, a bread roll and not a sandwich roll. At the price charged, the roll needs to be at LEAST 8 inches long and still contain sufficient lobster to spill out of the edges to the point of being nearly impossible to consume. Alternatively, Lobster ME may cut their prices down to $6 per roll. 

I am doubtful either will happen. As such, hungry men everywhere, unite! Demand value and say "NO!" with me to this cruel and unusual punishment of our wallets and our appetites!"}

After reading a couple of reviews I felt the need to rant.
Unfortunately, many people who write reviews don't know food and are not that into food.  Their frame of reference is either limited or they really prefer the food the grew up with and think that's "the bomb" and nothing else is as good.
Tony Gemignani is an 11 time world champion in pizza.  The first year he competed in Italy he swept the competition in all three categories, meaning he walked away with 3 gold medals, beating completion from Italy and all over the world.  So, obviously, the man knows pizza!!!!
I had wanted to eat at one of his places for a few years, knowing his reputation, but they were all in central California, an area I never visit.  I was thrilled to learn that he was opening here in Vegas and ate there the end of October 2013.
Everyone has an idea of what a crust should be like.  It's usually what they grew up eating, and anything else is lousy.  Tony has 3 ovens, a gas, an electric and a wood fired oven, all different temperatures.  The type of pie/crust you order determines which oven it will be cooked in.
For me, a pizza nut, hands down the best crust I've ever had.  Nice crunch, air pockets, good chew and yet still light and airy.
The quality is there on the toppings, cheese and sauce.  I did not eat anything else but the pizza so cannot comment on anything else on the menu.  I wish I could eat there twice a week.  
You want terrific pizza?  Now you know where to go."}

Super cute on the outside and inside, walk up window or inside seating. Walls painted black, crystal chandeliers, and a huge semi truck all in the same room, and they made it work. So the food, we ordered the margarita pizza, the owner won a pizza contest in Italy for it so that was a no brain er,  and a pear, walnut and Gorgonzola salad. Nice server, took the order, then never came back, it was not busy, finally someone else brought everything out at once, we didn't care about that after all it's a pizza place. The salad was good, about the same as that salad anywhere you go, but the pizza was cold! We had to call the server over to see if maybe it was supposed to be served that way? Nope, he took it back, and brought us a hot one. It was good, very simple good crust, tomato sauce just like in Italy, and yummy mozzarella and basil. Don't know if I will go back, sure they don't care given the location, just not stellar. I live right downtown and am always looking for places to support down here, but....... Oh yes, if you go make sure you mention it if you are local, cause no one asked us so no discount!"}

After visiting twice, I have decided I do like Pizza Rock.

The first visit for dinner, I wasn't terribly impressed. We ordered the old Chicago cracker thin crust pizza and a house salad. 

The old Chicago pizza was okay but nothing I needed to order again. Specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. Although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. It was a bit greasy as well.

The house salad is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. For $6, I'd pass on this.

Enticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. We ordered the personal pizza sized Molinari and the Cal Italia for $7 each and tried the fried green beans for $3 and fried calamari for $5.

The green beans were pretty good. They are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. For those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. For $3, the serving size is quite generous.

The fried calamari was delicious! The calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. Portion size was rather large. You can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. Personally, I found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so I'll stick to the regular version.

The pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' Chicago.

For me, the Cal Italia was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and balsamic reduction and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. I almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.

The Molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call Everybody's Favourite back home in Canada (Sausage and Mushroom). The crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. Some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. So good and totally guilty pleasure.

Overall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. Although some of the items are hit or miss, the Molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. Service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went Happy Hour during the week and Sunday evening at 5:30pm). Overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4."}

We were seated promptly since it was in the middle of the afternoon on a Saturday. They are located right across the street from The Grand Hotel & Casino. They validate parking for The Grand parking structure, so you don't pay a dime, no matter how long you stay! 
We ordered 'The New Yorker' which is a 16" pie with pepperoni, sliced meatballs, and mozzarella swirls. The pie took about 20 minutes to come out. After receiving the pie, we started to dig in and I saw that they were very generous with all the toppings. The mozzarella swirls tasted quite interesting, somewhat sweet and very creamy unlike any mozzarella I have ever had. I thought that the pepperoni were too oily and crunchy for my taste, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Overall, the pie was tasty, but I thought that it was too pricey for a small pie. For a 16" pie, it was $23, but with tax and tip, it came out to $30. 

I would try it out, but if I came back, I would definitely try something else!"}

That being said, it is lobster, which is not a cheap ingredient, and it is the Las Vegas strip, which has fewer and fewer bargains these days.  On my last trip to Lobster ME, I had the Cajun lobster roll with tater tots.  It's a decent size roll (the large) with the requisite buttery split top crust.  But, the lobster was overcooked, it wasn't tough, but it was getting close.  It certainly wasn't succulent, which properly prepared lobster is.  I liked the spice on the roll, and it's stuff full, so the amount is not an issue.

The tater tots are okay, better than say, Sonic, but just okay.  The entire meal is $27, which again, I don't think it's worth.  However, as noted above, I understand that lobster is not cheap and I don't expect to find value in a mall on the Las Vegas strip.  You can certainly do a lot worse if you are looking for a quick meal on the strip, but don't expect to be blown away at Lobster ME."}

If it's over 100 degrees outside, it's going to be hard to keep seafood super fresh. When in doubt, stick to non-seafood items in the summer on the strip!

But also know that I actually sought out this restaurant because more than one professional restaurant reviewer listed Pizza Rock as amongst the "Top 10 Pizzas - 2014" in Las Vegas. In addition, these writers noted that the restaurant has multiple pizza ovens - different ovens to facilitate the production of different styles (Neapolitan, Roma, New York, Chicago...) of pizza, and this caught my interest.

So let's start with the positives:

It has a great location. It is across the street from the Downtown Grand, or one block off of Fremont Street. So if you want to get away from the noise, and casino and chain eateries on Fremont Street without having to drive, it a good option.

The interior is well decorated. If you want to have a nice meal without distractions, you can.  And if you want to sit in an area with views of TV screens to monitor your sports team, you can.

The pricing is very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber, and the service was also very good.

But with regards to the food.... I can only give "an average" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the Traditional Neapolitan Margherita pizza, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was doughy and more like fresh bread. The bottom (flat area) of the crust was "wetter" than I prefer. Maybe this is the new trend. (I also visited "800 Degrees" on the Las Vegas Strip, and experienced the same issue of wet crust.) Perhaps I need to try a different "style" of pizza next time?

Here's the bottom line: the place is nice enough that I am willing to go back and try another meal. And having read my review, the staff is friendly enough: you or I can describe the textures we want from our pizza to the server. They can suggest a style of pizza that is to your liking, or they can ask the kitchen to accommodate. And they do have other entrees besides pizza.

It has a full bar, and a good selection of standard and craft beers."}

The gluten free crust was good and the ingredients were fresh so that's positive. I'm a total pizza snob so maybe my standards are too high. The truffle fries were really good which is the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2, which I still think is generous because really, I'm in Vegas, I should be able to get good fries lots of places. We did sit outside which was nice. I'm sure there's a better choice for pizza downtown though."}

It was the only place with decent rating in the area.  They have some humorous décors through the restaurant and even at the bathroom.  The place was well maintained with clean dining area.

We started some garlic breads, the seasoning was ok, but the bread was bit stale, probably because it was almost time to close?

For pizza, we got the Cali Italia and Downtown, the Cali looked interesting with a swirl of sauce on top, but it tasted a bit strange with a sweet taste that takes away from the vast savoriness below.  The Downtown looked like a mess when it first arrived.  Flavor was a bit with an overwhelming tomato and sauces in it.  I do not believe we finished either of the pizza

Perhaps the pizzas from Pizza Rock were meant to be consumed after you have been heavily intoxicated, or maybe we just came a bit late at night for the chefs to care what was being sent out."}

We got the Detroit pizza and the New Yorker. Overall wasn't bad. The New Yorker had a bit too much sauce and not enough cheese. The pepperoni, although tasting good, is the kind that curls up when it's cooked, a sign of a cheap product. The Detroit was good. Nothing special though. My daughter and son are allergic to cheese so we got them a pie with just sauce, pepperoni, and bacon. According to my daughter it was the best cheese-less pizza she has ever had. 
The atmosphere was questionable. It was a Saturday night around 8 when we got there. It was crowded which is a good sign. Lots of TVs  that had the college games on. My big complaint was the music. It was bumping so loud that we couldn't even talk to each other without having to scream across the table. Not cool. It was like night club loud. Then around 9 o'clock, they turned the game off and put music videos on. Music was still just as loud. That was a big let down. 
Overall, it's a good place to try out. The pizza is WAY overpriced for the product which is average at best, but given the location, it's about exploiting the tourists. They have a carry out counter up front to get slices at, which is a nice idea."}

I tried this place last year and haven't shut up about it since.  Was in Vegas last weekend for my birthday and, not gonna lie, totally ate here twice within 24 hours, haha.

I was saving the lobster mac and cheese for my actual birthday, but I had to eat something the night before and since I was staying at the Elara (which is attached) I thought, "Well, I can have the lobster grilled cheese instead, so it's totally not cheating." The lady serving was super nice and we chatted for a couple of minutes, then my order was ready so I grabbed the container and headed up to my room to get ready for Chippendales (if you haven't been, GO.)

I sprawl all of my crap all over my room and jump up on the bed and open the container- IT WAS LOBSTER EFFING MAC AND CHEESE BY MISTAKE.

Best. Mistake. Ever. I wasn't even mad- trust.

I inhaled it. And then I went back and got it again the next day on my actual birthday and inhaled it all over again.  No regrets.

It's a little bit pricey - $13 or $14+ per entre, but DAMN, I'm still thinking about it. None of the others I have tried have even compared, honestly.

Thank you thank you thank you."}

The ricotta cheese on the New Yorker was a perfect compliment to the whole taste of the pizza! I made sure to smear it all over my piece:) mmmm mmmm mmmm

note... The New Yorker was mostly a meat pizza with in house homemade sausage..yummy

The Downtown was loaded with beautiful veggies and with homemade sausage also.

Both were fabulous! I must try on your trip to Vegas!!!"}

Man, good food, good beer what else can you ask for, great service perfection all in one restaurant. Came here with some friends who live in vegas after we checked out container park and man im glad they took me here. Started with the white wine clams... amazing, by this time we were all laughing and drinking that we got pretty drunk so we didnt get a pizza but we did get the spaghetti and meatballs... OMG they were so good like stuffed my face eat so fast good. How does a pizza joint make such great food? Now the service is flawless our waitress taylor was by far the best waitress ive ever had, super fast and attentive number one employee of the month.  This place is def a must try when your in the neighbor hood of downtown but even than if your craving pizza or anything this place has got some good stuff and i will def be back for more. Keep it up"}

The rockstar pizzaiolo's claim to fame here is that he makes something like a dozen different styles of pizza out of six or seven different types of ovens burning different materials at different temperatures.

I'm a firm believer though that it's extraordinarily difficult to do a lot of different things and be great at all of them. Howard Johnson was a utility player for the New York Mets in the late 1980s. He was a third baseman by trade, but also played shortstop, second base, left field and right field. He was a good third basemen. He was terrible in the outfield.

Basically what I'm getting at is that Tony Gemignani is the Howard Johnson of pizza. He does a few styles of pizza really well. And a few others ... well, he tries.

The best of the bunch, by a long shot, is the sausage and stout pizza, topped with fontina cheese and infused with Guinness in the crust. It's made in limited quantities each day and is worth getting there early for. The Detroit Red Top is like a Chicago deep dish on steroids - order one of these and you'll be eating it for a week.

Somewhat less successful is the New Yorker pie - an interpretation of a classic that just feels... off. Maybe he's trying to elevate it. But the whole point of New York pizza ... if you're elevating it, you're doing it wrong."}

I've had Lobster Rolls in San Diego, Santa Monica and now at this Lobster ME location in Las Vegas (Planet Hollywood) and THIS LOBSTER ROLL IS THE BEST! The meat is succulent, juicy, flavorful and fresh. If you're going to spend $18 on a sandwich, know that for a Lobster Roll, this one is worth it. It also comes with Kettle chips and cole slaw. Ok, the cole slaw is more like a tasting (size wise) that you'd get at Costco but it's not what I came here for so not a big deal. Back to the Lobster Roll...you MUST try it if you like seafood and Lobster in particular. 

Seating wise...it is off of the strip and we came in on a Saturday evening (10pm-ish) so it was quite packed which is why we took ours to go. It's more counter service than a sit down place unless you can find an open seat that seems to cater to both Lobster Me and Fat Tuesday which is literally next door -it's a food court so you take your chances on seating, other than that, the food was worth standing in line and waiting. Give it a try!"}

The Frenchy (is the sandwich I had myself) is very light breading if you want something lighter than the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was bomb too! All of it was bomb. The lobster mac and cheese was pretty much the best one for me though.

Having been regular customer of both the San Francisco and Sacramento locations I can honestly say this location is a total fail.  A great restaurant that has different sites needs to focus on a consistent menu and product taste.  When I asked for my two favorites the Original tomato pie or the Delarenzo it was not to be found.  I settled on the New Yorker.  What a mistake.  The pizza showed no balance over powering low fat ricotta cheese no mozzarella, pizza sauce that had zero taste and high in acid.  Small portions of sausage.   Again nothing like the perfect pizza you get at the other two locations.  The Stromboli had no pepper and was over powering with ricotta.  Someone in the back must love the stuff. Again, no consistency with Tony location in San Francisco or pizza Rock in Sacramento.  Please visit this location and fix your pizza problems."}

Well this place beat me to it and did it better than I ever could.

The concept is solid. The execution is, well impressive. Only drawback is that the sheer variety of doughs they have to make forces them to limit several of the pies to a daily maximum. On one occasion they were already out of the pizza we wanted. Still, our second choice was quite good so no harm, no foul.

Happy hour food specials are very reasonable and quite good. The meatballs, although simple, are excellent.

Slice bar up front serves only the new york-style slice, which is definitely not the strength of this place, but if you are in a rush I think the Picante slice is a creative change of pace from traditional flavors and is definitely worth a try.

A german hefeweizen would go great with the spicy notes found throughout the menu, unfortunately there is none to be found here."}

This location is located inside the Planet Hollywood. We went on a friday night which was probably a bad idea. The place was pretty packed. We actually didn't have any place to sit when we first put in our order. We got lucky though and snagged two tables later on. Just so everyone is aware this place has very little seating. What is frustrating is you'll see one person sitting at a table not even eating and the only thing you're thinking about is where the fuck am I gonna eat this lol. I gave two stars for the food which isn't bad. I ordered the lobster and chips and I got the lobsicle. I didnt return the food because I was so hungry I just ate it. I was pretty disappointed that they screwed up my order. They don't give you many french fries so if you order anything with fries they really skimp on them. I ate my meal and I was still hungry. Luckily my sister inlaw gave me some of her lobster mac and cheese which was just ok. This place isn't cheap. The meal's dont come with drinks. I ordered a Sprite and they charged me $3.00 plus tax and it was a small cup. It's not a bad place if you happen to be at Planet Hollywood and you want to get your Lobster on but I would'nt make a special trip. One more thing, they're suppose to give you a 20% locals discount but this location didn't do that. I think it's fucking bullshit because I know they honor this at the other location at the Venetian."}

I finally got the chance to see what Pizza Rock was all about! And yep, it indeed rocks! I am very sad that I didn't have an opportunity to try the meatballs, but that just means I'll have to return for them.

The restaurant wasn't very crowded on Saturday night around 10:30, and we were seated right away. Our server was friendly and attentive (even though I could tell that he was slightly irritated by my indecisive and tipsy companion). I appreciated that he never let the smile leave his face, though! 

We had a few drinks, the Rosemary Garlic fries,  and split the Honey Pie pizza. The fries were delicious, but they do not skimp on the garlic, so be forewarned! The Honey Pie pizza would have been great on its own, but my companion insisted on adding spicy  sausage to it. Although tasty, this overwhelmed the flavor of the pizza. It probably would have been good with just regular sausage. 

The best part about Pizza Rock is the ambiance! They were playing really fun (and funny) videos on the tv screens all around the restaurant. The volume was loud enough to feel festive, but not so loud that you couldn't hear a conversation. 

Rock On, Pizza Rock!"}

The menu is virtually the same from Tony's Pizza Napolitana in SF.  It includes his famous award winning Margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from NY Style, Romana, California Style, and Gluten-Free.  And it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  Don't forget to check out his burgers too.

Same menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional Italian restaurant look from Tony's in SF, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for Vegas actually.  That being said, the pizza is really top notch.  And although I've been to Tony's in SF a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that I still haven't tried.  My friends and I decided on their Cal Italia and the Honey Pie.

Cal Italia -- http://bit.ly/1bGfTSF
Gold Medal Winner - Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge
Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, 
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction 
Although I've been to Tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning Cal Italia.  It's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  Very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  I really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time I come back to either here or at Tony's in SF.

Honey Pie -- http://bit.ly/1kBVpvu
Quail Hollow Farm Honey, Calabrese Peppers, Green Onions, Mozzarella, Piave Cheese, 
Fried Caramelized Onions, Serrano Peppers
I've had this pie before at Tony's in SF and I ordered it again to share with my friends in Vegas so they can try it for the first time.  It's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  If you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a Chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that I can compare this pizza to.  Although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  But for some reason, I wasn't tasting the honey.

One honorable mention I recommend from is their Burrata Burger.  I didn't have this at Pizza Rock but I've had it at Tony's in SF.  I think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  You get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (http://bit.ly/1ePXy9t). Definitely worth trying out!  

I think what I like best is that the wait time at Pizza Rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in SF where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  Though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  It looks like Pizza Rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, I can see it doing very well in Downtown Vegas."}

I sampled the lobster ice cream and it was definitely interesting.  Tasted like butter cream with bits of lobster.  Not bad, but the texture is unexpected.  We ended up ordering a lobster grilled cheese sandwich and a lobster roll (photos are included).  The lobster roll was small but was very good.  The grilled cheese sandwich was also good but was a little bland.  They had tapatio sauce to help spice it up.

Over all for a lobster roll, and lobster grilled cheese, and 1 drink, the total was a little over $30.  It was a good place to munch while you are shopping.  Other items on the menu included lobster mac n cheese and lobster soup in a bread bowl.  What I did not like about this place was the wait literally took forever.  I also did not like that it did not provide enough places to sit down.  This was a good place to grab something good and go."}

Place: Great location! ample space between tables. FABulous Fat girl seating. and nice little 2 person curtained booths for 'date night' oh and the giant "peterbuilt truck" is a full on WIN. *it's their dj booth* - Win & 5 *****

Service: We went on a Sunday, no reservation and at 4pm - Football time. No wait at all. We got right in. Got our drinks ordered (more on those later) then we got a new server. Nice guy, lousy waiter. I hope he's a dancer or an actor because waiting tables, he'll starve. Slow service, never came back to follow up, we had to actually go to the bar to order a 2nd round of drinks. there were only 4 other tables in the place though 1 was a party of 6. however we were all by each other. so sorry but only 2 **

Food: We had the truffle fries: Excellent! not too truffly to overwhelm. We went with the classic Pepperoni x-cheese & sauce: perfection - Just like my favorite NYC brick oven pizza. The right amount of crust to topping ratio. Not a tough dough, just a good chew. We want to go back to try some of their specialties like the   SPACCA NAPOLI or the Picante. Tiramisu: just the right amount of soaked ladyfingers to alcohol. 5****

Drinks: We were excited to see bacon bloody Marys on the menu. *if you follow me, you know i'm the queen of bloody Marys in Vegas* so of course we ordered 2. Nicely garnished with a very nice hearty piece of perfectly cooked bacon (not some floppy end under cooked piece* and a seasoned rim. Then we tested it. heavy aftertaste in the bloody Mary mix. Not nearly as good as even Mrs. T which is pretty inferior. But I finished mine & my son's. He wanted a shot & by then I'd had 2 might as well go for a 3rd, eh? we waited. and waited. & someone took the 'dead soldiers' we asked for our waiter. and waited. and waited. finally I (after 2 bloody marys) went to the bar to order. He brought them over without even questioning why i had ordered them from the bar. 2 ** 

Bill: 
3 bloody marys & 1 shot  & 1 soda. 
1 classic pepperoni 
2 split appetizer 
1 dessert 
AND 
1 additional pepperoni to go for dinner tonight *yum* 

62.50.  this was with a 15% local discount and an additional 5% for checking into their facebook page.  that's another 5***** 



So worth the trip. But please if you are reading this from Pizza Rock, step up your bloody Mary game. :-)"}

My lobster roll didn't use mayo and celery like Mary's, I think it may have been lemon and celery salt, but it was fresh and there was plenty of meat. He had a lobster BLT and wolfed it down without offering me a bite. The two sandwiches with one very small portion of fries, a water, a soda and a small draft was $50, so it's not cheap for something that wouldn't fill you up if you're really hungry, but it was delicious."}

Our server was quick to keep my bloody mary filled which was VERY nice.  We had appetizers the calamari they have a regular and spicy(she let us have it 1/2 the one flavor and 1/2 the other), so it was almost like having 2 apps in 1!  We also had the coccoli, which was a hot puff pastry almost like a hollow donut (no sugar) with cheese (almost like buratta) and this amazing prosciutto, we cut open the "donut" and stuffed it with cheese and meat. AMAZING!  We ordered the crispy chicago pizza, OMG I love thin crust pizza and the crust was burnt so perfectly it was so good also.  We would stop here again if we were in town.

Good food and great service."}

I came to the food court looking for Earl of Sandwich, but my hunger didn't allow me to make it around the corner and I decided to eat here. I'm a fan of lobster, especially when I don't have to crack the shell and get messy eating it. This place is pricey for a quick lunch, but it was delicious nonetheless. You'll spend about $20 bucks plus for lunch for one. I don't regret my purchase, I only regret eating it so fast because it was soo good.

I ordered the Cajun Lobster roll, fries, and a drink. The roll comes toasty/grilled and buttery with good chucks of lobster meat stuffed on hotdog style. I could eat 4 of these easily because each bite was so juicy, buttery with a hint of crisp from the roll. The lobster had a nice cajun spice to it which added another dimension to the flavor. 

Punch line: Come here for delicious hassle free lobster!"}

We never had the patience to wait in line for Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. But I found out Tony Gemignani opened this place in Las Vegas...what an opportunity!

We came here around 3pm midweek...the place was empty. The bartender served us...he was very friendly and efficient when the place started filling up later.

We started with the gorgonzola and apple salad...this was probably the tastiest thing we had. It was a tasty mix of greens, gorgonzola, apples, candied walnuts, dried cherries and an overly sweet "balsamic" vinaigrette. In a recurring theme, it was a bit pricey at $13. The kiddo had the classic cheese pizza, while we had their "World Pizza Cup Winner"  Margherita Pizza Napoletana at $17 for a 12-incher. This pizza was pretty good, but definitely not the best I ever had. It was...pleasant...but so was the regular cheese pizza. In the ingredients list, they list Fior di Latte mozzarella...in other words, regular cow's milk mozzarella, like 99% of all pizzas in this country! This is what disappointed me the most...at this price, they didn't use mozarella di bufala...this would have made a HUGE difference in taste...as it was, the cheese was rather bland and tasteless. 

So the food was ok...but very pricey. If you are in the neighborhood, by all means stop by if there is no line. I wouldn't make a special trip or wait for this food however."}

It was bland. Salt is a catalyst in "conveying" flavor. Charred crust can be delicious; however, they have managed to make it bitter to the point of no return. And the basil. Oh don't get me started. I love basil, but the basil on my pie was rotten.  To be honest, Little Ceasars is better tasting, and I don't like Little Ceasars very much. Don't brag about how amazing your pizza is when in all reality, it's nothing to write home about.

To make things worse, I waited 45 minutes for my order--even those who were in line behind me received their food before me.

$19 for a Cajun Lobster Roll. Here's my issue: Most of the lobster meat was dry, and tasted as if it was merely re-hydrated. Second, it's underwhelming because the "cajun" flavor was nothing more than an excessive amount of cayenne, paprika, and/or pepper. There's nothing that stands out. The bun was okay, and the house-made salt and vinegar chips were crispy.

The employees, who were probably a bit flustered from the longer than expected line, ended up giving my order to someone named "Sarah," yet continued to call her name out for her actual order until I finally walked up and told them that I still didn't have mine after 30 minutes. Oh, yeah--I waited another 15 minutes for them to re-make my sandwich. In the end, the cashier apologized, and offered to throw in an extra lobster roll for free, but I kindly declined. It wasn't his fault, but my advice to them is to double-check the orders. My lobster roll sucked, but hopefully those of you reading this have a better experience than I did."}

Look out for coupons if you are staying in surrounding hotels or coupon books u can pick up at the Miracle Miles guest services.  The venetian location had a 20 or 25% off a sandwich and the coupon at Miracle miles included a 16 oz beer with the purchase of a lobster roll ;)"}

We went there one day for lunch to celebrate my co-workers birthday. We chose this spot because they have gluten free pizzas and my co-worker can't eat gluten. We arrive and the restaurant is semi busy but nothing crazy for St. Patty's day. We ordered three pizzas, one pepperoni pizza, one gluten free vegetarian pizza and a MARGHERITA pizza (one of the house specialties). First thing, the place wasn't busy. Let's make note of that. Secondly and this is a pet peeve of mines especially since I come from the hospitality industry, our server did not write our orders down. PEOPLE!!! I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, UNLESS YOU HAVE OVER 10 YEARS OF RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE THEN YOU BETTER BE WRITING DOWN ORDERS. And here's why...first pizza out was the pepperoni, 10 mins later the vegetarian pizza comes out. 10 mins later, we're still waiting for our pizza. We flag down our server and tell him that our pizza has yet to arrive. Before even checking to see what the status was on our pizza he says it'll be out soon and that's due to the restaurant being busy. So we wait, and wait, and wait. The guys have already eaten their pizza and the vegetarian is about half way through and still nothing. We flag him down again and he goes to look and claims someone walked off with our pizza. Yeah right. Keep in mind, there is no sorry yet. So we ask to see a manager. She comes by claims that she was just told this and she will have it out soon. and she will comp it off the bill? Not a sorry or anywhere near it. Any good manager would know to always apologize to the guest after hearing how their staff messed up a table. We kept telling her that we've been waiting and the server hadn't really down a good job but all she kept saying was I was just told this. By this time yes the restaurant had picked up but there was no way our pizza would have been overlook had the server stayed on his tables. He would have seen that pizzas were missing and he should have gone to the kitchen and asked them right away what the status was on our food and then gone back to check on it. 

On the plus side, food was delish and they had a semi truck inside the restaurant but with all that bad service that's not enough to encourage a visit anytime soon."}

Location - in Downtown near the Fremont street experience. Not a lot of convenient parking since it is downtown. 

Restaurant - loud, spacious, plenty of seating for large and/or small parties.

Service - A-ok.  No complaints about our server. 

Food- tried meatballs and calamari (half spicy / half regular) for appetizers. And Picante pizza for main meal. Overall not bad but nothing memorable. I didn't like the spicy calamari though. I thought they would toss in cherry peppers or something like that for the spiciness. Except it was more like chili powder. Way too overpowering in a bad way.

I'd give it one more shot and order something different to truly judge whether it's worth repeat visits or not."}

Lobster roll was probably one of the better ones I've had and for $19, the price was fair and portion was generous.  The clam chowder fries were tasty.  This is something you think of doing as a kid and as an adult and the chowder making the fries soggy with bites of clam is a winner.

When you walk inside, towards your right you can buy pizza by the slice. To the left of that is the hostess stand and dining area. The line was short on one visit and longer on the next. They really move the line through nicely. They have some stools at the counter to the right of the register where you order, but it's a tight space and there isn't a lot of seating. I just plan on popping in and grabbing my slices to-go when I come here. I like that they offer the typical cheese ($4) and pepperoni ($4.50) slices as well as a different "slice of the day" ($6) each day. The slices are huge. You can't beat the price, portion or quality. I tried some Sicilian cheese and it wasn't bad, but could have been more crispy on the bottom instead of being a tad too soggy. I'd still give it another try during another visit. 

They offer a variety of pizzas baked at a variety of temperatures here at Pizza Rock. I plan of trying most of them. The menu says only 73 of pizza champ Tony's award winning margherita pizzas are made per day. There are actually other pizzas that are made in limited amounts each day, but the margherita is a favorite. I'd call ahead if you are interested in any of the limited batch pizzas. Unless you are meeting a group of people here I'd just call your order in anyway for pick-up to avoid the parking hassles of downtown and have someone drop you off to grab your order. The pizza window is currently open until around midnight Sun - Thurs and until around 2 am on Friday and Saturday."}

It's definitely all in the crust. You have to have mastered the crust for a pizza to be so delicious! Being a vegetarian I ordered the zucchini fried which I HIGHLY recommend! They had a nice, thick breaded crust which was perfectly fried: crisp crunch on the outside and a nice soft inside. They came with a side of some tasty spicy sauce and they were delicious! My friend had the meatballs, 3 large sauce covered balls of meat, and he loved them! For our pizza choices I decided to veer off the "award winning" recommendation of their margherita once I saw a little thing called the Honey Pig listed below it on the menu. Glad I did! It came with a honey glaze, cheese, poblano peppers and caramelized onions on top. Diverse and delicious! My friend chose the Sausage and Stout Pizza and not being a big sausage lover (no pun intended! ) he still loves this pizza and orders it (almost) every time. We ordered the mud pie for dessert but it was a little too frozen to fully enjoy but came as a good size portion. Overall, this place is a win and I definitely recommend it if you find yourself downtown and looking for a great pizza!"}

I really like their menu and food, but I just cannot give a restaurant with good food and consistently slow service anything better than a 2-star.  I wanted to give this place more stars because I like their menu and their food was good, but it just took too long all three times I have eaten at its various locations.  During my last trip, I ordered their basic lobster roll and soup because I was in a hurry and I figured that by ordering their main items would be quicker.  Nevertheless, that didn't help.  I waited for probably 20 minutes for the food.  They could have brought the soup over early to make the wait seem shorter, but they waited and brought both items over together.  What really got me though was that the single runner they had working was busy eating his own food while about 3 other groups and I were waiting on our food.  

Don't get me wrong, the food is good!  The 2 star is simply because they are 0 for 3 when it comes to service."}

I've more respect and appreciation for Lobster ME. They've changed many things since the last time I've been here. New menu items! The freezer in front where they house their lobster ice cream is now in the back. That ice cream was the reason I fell out of love for this place.

Price-wise, it's inexpensive for the amount and quality of lobster you get on their lobster rolls...and you're saving money for not having to take a trip to New England! They'll charge you the same price for a lobster roll in New England anyway. $17 for a regular Maine-style lobster roll or $23 for large. But wait, if you're local, you get 20% off! 

The bun on the lobster roll is buttery and toasted. Generous amounts of lobster with large claws on top. From their new menu, I tried garlic fries. It was very garlicky, yum!

the only thing that i would recommend getting is the lobsticle!  it's a lobster tail that is smothered in tempura batter and fried (yes, FRIED, again!!!).  it was really good, although pretty small and still cost $12!  the lobster grilled cheese was GROSS to me.  i don't know what kind of white cheese they used but it did not taste good, it was too mayo-ish.  i mean, i love mayo just as much as the next person but really it was like smothered in this mayo cheese.  i would not order that again."}

3 stars because it was expensive! and the portions are small! But let me tell you, where can you walk around, get a Fat Tuesday and walk 10 feet and get a lobster on a stick! Such a good combo! 

Lobsicle- $14 but worth a try. Not super large, but it was fried to perfection. Their batter is crispy and not too bready. Very good! Pretty greasy though, especially if they already give you a side of butter. 

Cajun Fries- Absolutely the best Cajun fries I've ever had in my life. I will come back here next time and skip the lobster and order the fries. Soo good!

Lobster and Chips - not worth it. in total, there was probably like 4 bite sized pieces of fried lobster with some fries. Pass on this and get something else on the menu that's more worth it."}

As others have said, it was a bit pricey but again we're talking about Lobster here folks! The place is located in the Mile of shops next to the Planet Hollywood hotel/casino. Suite #435. 

I had the Lobsicle. Which was basically an amazing huge chunk of lobster fried on a stick. I also upgraded to the cajun fries, which honestly I don't remember how they were because I was in Lobster Heaven. The husband ordered the Maine Lobster Roll which was a toasted buttery roll with huge Maine Lobster claws in it. The lobster was cold, which was a bit unexpected, but who knows maybe that's how it's supposed to be? He also had the garlic fries but I believe he didn't eat them because that huge Maine Lobster roll filled him up! We also ordered a bucket of beer, because well, it's Las Vegas! All together our total was $56 and worth every cent. 

I can't wait until our next annual trip back to Vegas. Lobster Me is going to be one of the first stops, perhaps before even checking in! Yeah, it's that good."}

At $ 17 for the 4" lobster roll and $ 23 for the 6" roll, this place isn't cheap but it is comfort food at it's near best.  Only thing that could improve is the setting.  You are literally sitting at a table just off the main aisle of the often noisy Miracle Mile Mall that encircles the Planet Hollywood Casino.  Trust me, this is not a picnic table on the coast of Maine.

The rolls are filled generously with only lobster meat - non of those celery or breading fillers...just a touch of butter and mayo to add to the flavor.  You always get the meat from two claws on top every 4" roll and three or more on the 6".  The roll is classic New England - cut on the sides unlike a standard hot dog bun and toasty warm from the grill.  It contrasts nicely with the cold lobster meat.

When in Vegas, Lobster Me will definitely fill the bill and put a smile on your face."}

Pros:
1. The Beltway! $17 Warm Maine lobster tossed with Old Bay spice, shallots & chives, served in a toasted brioche bun, topped with butter-toasted panko crumbs. 
2. Each sandwich roll comes with a side of homemade potato chips and cole slaw. Not bad for $17. 
3. Big chunks of lobster meat.

Cons:
1 The Connecticut. $17 Warm lobster meat tossed in melted butter. - No FLAVOR!  Had to ask for a side of drawn butter to liven it up!
2. Lightly burnt the bun on the Connecticut. Poor form! Boo!!!!

While on vacation, my sisters boyfriend was tasked with showing me some of the local eats, at least something that you can find during late hours. I haven't been to the Miracle Mile Shops, but essentially, it's a mall that includes night life and eating places.

After traveling towards the center of the place, you can find Lobster Me, located right next to a Fat Tuesday, if you want one of those big margarita drinks that everyone walks around with. The place itself is only a usual mall-foodcourt type of storefront, so it's a free-for-all on seating, which isn't much in the direct area. It might be hard to find seating, especially if you're with a group, because there are a lot of people bumbling around, especially at night.

There were a lot of things that I wanted to try on the menu, but there lies a small endeavor, everything is crazy expensive. I know that it's seafood, lobster to be specific, but it was a bit expensive in my opinion. Expect to spend around $8-15 for most stuff on the menu.

I had the Lobster & Chips (you know, fish and chips, but lobster). I also upgraded my fries to calamari fries. I originally was just aiming for the regular clam chowder fries as my only dish, but I had some leeway on my budget, so I spent a little more. The lobster nuggets were pretty good, and the cam chowder fries helped round off the meal. I've had calamari fries at other places, but this one is just as good.

Definitely worth a try, check it out, but I wouldn't come here that often, simply because of the price."}

Definitely will be back for more next time we're in Vegas!!"}

Did you know, out by Bangor, they have vending machines that sell lobster dirt-cheap that are restocked daily?! That's crazy!

Lobster ME doesn't have vending machines, but they do have lobster rolls- stick to the classic Original Maine style with a touch of mayo and spices, or dare to try the new Beltway version with Old Bay, shallots, chives, and breadcrumbs. Anything else is blasphemous. 

If you're really feeling daring, add on the chowder fries and a drink for an extra $6- they're like chili cheese fries, but with chowder instead of chili, plus green onions and bacon bits. They're downright intoxicating, if you have the calories to spare.

Bonus star for quick service and 20% off local discount- it's a smallish (hot-dog sized) but meaty roll for $17, which is actually on par with pricing in other landlocked states (so minimal Strip markup?), but the discount makes it especially nice. A $20 lunch, which is pretty much the minimum for the Strip, and the quality is actually really good for a food court-style setting."}

Being in Vegas, I wouldn't expect good lobster/seafood at all due to the fact that the place is in the middle of the dessert, HOURS away from places to catch fish and fresh seafood. This lobster was pretty bomb though and there were pretty decently sized chunks of meat within the fried pieces of lobster. 

The main thing I disliked was the location. You basically eat out on the tables in the middle of the walkways in miracle mile and there was no secluded seating area strictly for the restaurant."}

RANDOM but this place showed the best customer service I had in Vegas this time around. The 2 cashiers we came across were nice and chatty (not invasive and awkward at all!) They must like working here :)
=======

We got:
Lobster bisque ($9) - comes in a sourdoughbread bowl and serves 2. Comes piping hot. Wish there was more lobster flavor, but hey, can't complain for the price. It was a'ight.

Lobster tacos ($14) - meh. I was trying to be a taaaaaaad healthier but regretted it right away. The lobster was kinda dry (I mean, I wasn't expecting it to be fresh.. but still - again, fair for the price) and the tortilla/salsa was pretty whatever. The salsa came in a small serving cup and was probably canned. It comes with chips so it makes it seem like it's a better deal, I didn't have any though. The portion was pretty satisfying.

Chowder fries ($7) - THIS WAS MY FAVORITE THING! It's just chunky fries with cheese and clam chowder, simple but oh, so good (not good FOR you of course..). The fries were big and seemed double-fried so it held up to the chowda and cheese. The flavor was spot-on. I would return just for this.. and MAYBE to try the lobster roll."}

The lobster in the sandwich was really fishy and just didn't taste fresh. I had about 4 bites of the first half of the sandwich and my husband had the other 3 or 4 bites. When I offered him the other half...well...he declined LOL.

I gave the other half to my friend and she ate it...and seemed to moderately enjoy it I guess.

The garlic roll was good but the lobster lacked flavor and was rubbery. The saving grace of our meal were the fries, and the lobster Mac & cheese which was reasonably priced.

I hate it when there's not a lot of soup in those bread bowls. 
The lobster roll was great as well. Soft sweet roll type of bread and a lot of lobster. However, not worth the price tag. Probably more like an $18 cost would've been better. I paid an extra $2 to upgrade to the lobster bisque. It was good. The broth was not thick, more of a lighter texture. Big chunks of lobster was a bonus. 

The beers on tap were not really cold. I think I would've taken the cans if I had to order again. They charge $0.54 for tap water cups. But she gave us 2 for free. The food came out fairly quickly. We were in a rush to get something in our bellies before a show. And managed to order, eat and get out within 25 minutes. That was with a small line. 

The tables are like mall food tables. So they're not the cleanest. But it's fast food, so you get a few extra napkins and have to wipe it down yourself. 

Overall food was tasty and it served it's purpose. I'd definitely eat again."}

The menu is a little expensive, but it's EVERYTHING LOBSTER.  You can't be cheap on that.  I like coming here for lunch since the portion isn't big so you don't feel too stuffed.  Especially if you have to get ready to go to the club.  I always order the Maine lobster roll which basically has lobster with butter on top.  I like to keep it simple.  The roll had a good amount of lobster meat.  You get what you pay for.  I added a side of Lobster Chowder and it was delicious!  There were actual chunks of lobster and the chowder wasn't too salty either.  There's a lot of different options to choose from and so far, I haven't been disappointed."}

All the specialty lobster rolls come with chips for $19.  They're not big portions either.  

I had the lobster and chips, which came with a "Lobsicle" or lobster on a stick, a side of butter, and fries for $15.  The Lobsicle was so small.  This meal was probably 85% fries, and 15% lobster.  Tastes excellent, but I was still hungry in the end.  $15 and still hungry.  

Good flavor, but expensively priced."}

This place is one of the better quick dining options in the Miracle Mile. I hate to call this place fast food but it does Flt the category for a quick lunch.

I have done both the original an Cajun rolls here. My personal favorite is the Cajun. It is just the right amount of spice yin to the sweet lobster meats yang! The original is your basic lobster roll: chilled lobster meat tossed in secret sauce. 

There is a third version on the menu that i am too much of a coward try; it goes by the name of diablo. Call me silly but I want to enjoy the lobster roll and not have it blowtorch my tongue while I'm eating it. 

Lobster rolls are one of my favorite sandwiches but there are not many places in town that do them. So being that said I get my fix here.."}

They give you a number to take to your table and they bring it out to you. It took about 15 mins to get our food. 

The rolls were good, bread was butterred and browned nicely, the lobster was cooked well and not chewy, nice mix of salad dressing and greens to lobster. The fries are waffle type and were cooked great and not to salty.

The clam chowder had a good flavor but not a lot of clams but hey, it's a mall food court and it was good for where it's located. We don't really expect 4 star food at a food court do we? ((:"}

Get there late or make a reservation to get a nice booth but make sure to visit the bar first as they have the best, friendliest bartenders in vegas. The basil cucumber martini was amazing and a great price during happy hour.

One last note if you can only go here once you absolutely, positively, with out doubt, no question about it must have the Cioppino. Yes its that good and just typing about it has made me so hungry I must go eat now..."}

We arrived 10 minutes early for our Friday night reservation and we walked right in, no waiting. 

The restaurant has outdoor seating and is located between Freemont Street Experience and The Mob Museum.  Located next to Hoggs & Heffers,  so keep that in mind before sitting outside. 

Old school, rustic vibe which we loved. We sat in the main dinner room by William the host and our waiter was Brian. Not overly busy for a Friday night and I am not sure why because the food was out of this world and the prices were extremely fair for the dining experience at this restaurant.  I am guessing it is the location,  but this place on the strip and they would be a high dining establishment.  Casual attire, or feel free to dress up either way you are fine.

Goat cheese in marinara sauce was very tasty,  nice size portion and fairly priced. The drinks were very reasonable with plenty of alcohol in rum and coke I ordered.  The wine we also ordered was very cold and again a perfect size and price.

The 16oz NY Strip was out of this world,  one of the best I have had. Very fairly price for quality of meat and portion.  I compare it to something you would find in a high end steak house.

The stuff shrimp with crab meat was also fantastic,  nice size portion. 

When back in Vegas this will be a place we visit again"}

My first thought was way too many waitstaff/ bartenders/ hosts, but then I got it, I really got it! Someone was always there to say hi, get a drink, fill water, clear a plate, take an order. And not in an obnoxious get out of here way but in a we want you to have everything you need to enjoy yourself. Each person we dealt with had a sense of humor, was courteous and was very knowledgeable on their food & wine. Being the foodies we are, we kept sitting by the kitchen to really watch the entire scene. Let me tell you something, these owners and management have truly invested in all of their staff. The executive chef was expediting from the back of the house to an expediter on the front of the house. It was truly amazing to watch such professionalism through out the experience. Being in the Bay area, this restaurant could easily take on the upper echelon here.  We loved it so much, we were there three nights in a row! Cannot wait to go back!

The night I want to review is our first night there. The three of us each ordered a martini style cocktail - lemon drop, cosmo, vodka martini. Each was made so well, the glass was cold and ice chips were at the top. 

We started with baked goat cheese marinara and oysters on the half shell. The baked goat cheese was excellent. The sauce was not at all overbearing- slight kick, good flavor of garlic and tomato, olive oil, the accompanying bread was fresh and warm. The goat cheese had a nice mild flavor to it, finishing off the dish very well. The oysters - wow - so fresh! I like smaller ones. These were closer to medium but very, very fresh and flavorful! They came with a house made vinaigrette which really accented the flavor.

For our entrees, I went to the dark side. I say that because I stay away from typical gamey meats in any restaurant. Well I chose this coq au vin creation with duck, lamb and beef (we were there a few months ago, so the memory is not quite there). This dish was absolutely amazing! All the meats were so tender, falling of the bones and melting in your mouth. The sauce was not at all too rich or heavy, coating the meat & veggies. The veggies were roasted to perfection.

One friend had the petrale sole. OK, this was huge! It was lightly battered, pan fried and all kinds of delicious! It was covered with a lemon butter sauce, not creamy at all just perfect. 

Another friend had porcini crusted rib eye. This was a huge cut of meat, grilled to perfection at medium rare. The steak was so tender, it too melted in your mouth. The porcini crust was an excellent compliment to the flavor of the rib eye. 

Triple George had an extensive wine list which was paired excellently to each of our dishes by the staff.

Everyone was beyond professional, completely exceeding any of our expectations!"}

Coworkers and I used to enjoy this place for lunch.  The last couple times that we have eaten here, however, the food has been very mediocre and the lunches turned into horrible experiences.  
The first incident involved debit cards used to pay the bill.  We were told that the credit card machine was down, so they processed the cards the "old way" of using the carbon copy swiper.  A day or so later every person that paid with a card had fraudulent transactions on their account.
We decided to go back several months later (with cash) and received two inaccurate orders.  When one order was sent back, he was told it would take about 20 minutes for the correct order to come out.  We had already been there for about 30 minutes, so it was brought up that the person whose order it was would not have time to eat their lunch.  The person asked for a possible discount for the inconvenience, etc.  The manager eventually came over and was beyond rude from the time he walked up to out table. He aggressively argued with the table and eventually stormed away.   
One good point about the restaurant is that the owner was present when this occurred  and did not charge our table."}

We walked in at 5 till 4 (when they switch to Dinner menu) and were seated.  The booth was soo comfortable & the atmosphere was great.  We started looking at the menu and didn't see some of the dishes that people had mentioned and photographed in our review of the Yelp site.  So, I asked about having a ribeye on the menu and the waitress asked if we would like to see the dinner menus.  Uh, yeah, didn't even think to look.  Asked about the specials and she said "the chefs are setting them now".  Alrighty, then.  So, we ordered the chicken parmesan with fettuccini alfredo instead of the pasta with red sauce for $16ish, and the 16 oz ribeye for $38...add a side of creamed corn $6.  Food took quite a while...especially since there were maybe 3 other occupied tables in the whole place.  Service was spotty, refills were slow.  I ordered my 16 oz ribeye medium.  What I got was a mid-well to well done steak that looked about 5 oz short.

The waitress was there when I cut into my steak and promptly returned it to the kitchen.  We still haven't gotten our creamed corn.  My hubby LOVED his chicken parm...it was one of the best either of us has had, and that's his jam.

My re-fired order took forever...like hubby on his last 2 bites already, forever.  I cut into it and it was mid-rare at best.  The manager came to check on the steak issue and I showed him it was  not medium.  I wasn't giving my plate up this time...I was starving!  So, I ate it as is.  Don't get me wrong, this was a good steak, it just wasn't what I ordered...especially for $38.  My hubby and I shared it along with the creamed corn that only arrived with my second steak.

At the end, they took off the iced tea and corn for my troubles...about 9 bucks, so that's something.

My hubby gave his dish a resounding 5 stars, my food was good, but overall experience was a 3."}

The menu food is a bit pricey to me (what can I say, sometimes I can be cheap).  However, they have an excellent Ten Under $10 lunch menu.  I've had the Grilled Chicken Breast off that, which was excellent -- very moist and hit the spot when I was on the healthy wagon.  

I also had a special of the day once, some type of turkey wrap, which was not as good. However, my friend tells me that in her former life as a waitress, special of the day usually translates to crap the restaurant is trying to get rid of.  So that may or may not have factored into that.

Although I haven't had it, my co-workers tell me the Reuben is also pretty good. 

Another tip -- if there's more than two people in your party for lunch, I recommend making lunch reservations. The place gets really full during the lunch hour.  The last time I went with people from work, there wasn't a table available and we had to sit side by side at  the counter.  While that works for two people, it doesn't so much for five! 

The food is consistently good and I think the decor/ambiance adds to the experience."}

She doesn't seem to know the sequence of service like checking back at the table to ensure food is correct and that we didn't need anything.  My wife needed more dressing for her salad and she didn't come back until I was almost done with my dinner.  The best part was when she took my napkin (once I was done eating) and proceeded to clean the table with it.  She did earn her 15% because she did the minimum a waitress is expected to do. 

It is great to see that Downtown Las Vegas is changing and for the best!  The restaurant is a stones throw from the Fremont Street Experience.

The greeting staff made us feel welcome and comfortable immediately.

We were seated and greated by our waiter who was friendly and attentive. We ordered drinks and began to go through the menu . I was impressed with the diversity of its content. Anything you could want from steak, pork. Chicken and sea food. A wonderful selection of old time comfort foods, braised ribs,  chicken pot pie, meatloaf wrapped in bacon, fried chicken. On the table was a fresh baked loaf of sour dough bread and fresh butter.

Drinks came and we're perfectly mixed and served. We ordered our meals and had time to visit. Surprisingly our meals were delivered all at one time and done to perfection I might add.  Our order included fried chicken, chicken saltimbocca, and a George burger which is 3/4 pound of burger bliss.

We shared a molten chocolate cake for dessert. We all walked away content. 

One note: we sat outside in the front and it was a little chilly- the heaters didn't do much. It can also get a little noisy with the pizza place patrons from next door and the bike bar nearby. Next time, I would wait a few minutes for a table to clear up inside, especially for something more intimate. I walked in to use the restrooms and pass the bar it's very pretty inside where the tables and booths are."}

They said if you wanted a good steak and salad with a walk up bar  if you were alone or in a small group, this was the place. They've got just a side bar area where younger folks can order a shot, several dining sections with dim lights for a classy environment for a group and then a great big bar with open seating where you can eat, have a drink and no reservation needed. Melanie was great, the food was outstanding and the price was very reasonable. All the  furniture retailers in town  staying at the Downtown Grand, at the Gold Nugget or any hotel within 3 blocks should make the Triple George a group outing while in town.

The first thing I noticed was how friendly and patient the hostess was because I could not remember whose name the reservation was under. As I was being seated, I noticed the bar area had ample space and the bartenders had excellent drink presentation. The overall space is a lot larger inside than it looks outside. 

The most amazing thing about this restaurant is the vegan menu with ample selections. I had the Vegan "chicken" Marsala and the house salad. Prior to the salad arriving, Mary, our server brought out bread with butter and olive oil. My friends raved on how crispy the outside was, yet the inside was soft and delectable. 

The mixed greens in my salad were fresh and crisp and I would recommend the balsamic vinaigrette.When my plate arrived, I was very pleased with the green beans and carrots. They had the right amount of crunch and tasted great with the marsala sauce and mushrooms that were atop my "chicken". Out of the vegetarian/vegan plates I have ordered over the years from various restaurants, this one looked the most appetizing. My friends who never want anything vegetarian, wanted to try the "chicken" marsala with the basmati rice and they loved it!  Needless to say, I cleaned my plate and enjoyed every bite! 

Since it was my friend's birthday, Mary brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream and whipped topping. The cake looked amazing and my friends enjoyed it. 

My bill was about $25, and although it was a little more expensive than what I would normally spend, it was well worth it and I will definitely be back!"}

I was very disappointed. I ordered a $60 steak, it was the daily special. It came out cold. Not warm, not luke-warm, not room temperature. Cold, as if it had been left out under the air conditioning vent. I informed the waiter, who at first attempted to place the cause on the fact that I ordered it medium rare. Sorry, I have eaten at MANY great steak restaurants, and never have I been served a cold steak "because it was medium rare." He took it back for them to flash it. He returned, and it was warmer. However, because there was a sauce on the steak, the sauce was now seared into the meat, it was no longer a sauce, but dried and cooked into the meat. Nothing was offered to compensate for the horrid food I was served, and I left unhappy. I do not recommend for any reason."}

Looking for a "real" quality restaurant away from the neon lights, pan handlers, and craziness?  Avoid the terrible casino restaurants and trendy tourist bar/grills on Fremont by taking a short walk to Triple George!
    Triple George is a classy, relaxed, old school steak and seafood house.  They're not pushing a fancy chain restaurant name or luring customers with plastic guitar bodies filled with rum and punch.
   Those in the know go to Triple George for a great steak, a great piece of seafood, a great beer or glass of wine.  You won't find Triple George to be a super fancy dining experience but you'll find yourself in a very comfortable upper-scale atmosphere with simply plated food that will speak for itself.

I'm always happy after Triple George!........ Never mind the biker bar next door :o"}

As a precursor to the date (ordering), your friend (the menu) tries to play up your potential mate (the dish) in the best light possible.  You'll hear things that sound too good to be true, like you're about to meet someone (eat something) who's a doctor during the week and saves dolphins on the weekend or a Victoria's Secret model who's looking for that special someone to blow her trust fund on (crab-stuffed shrimp).  The supporting highlights continue to roll in, things such as an impeccable fashion sense (chef's fresh vegetable selection) or their amazing sense of humor (lemon butter sauce).

After committing to the date (the dish), there's still that twinge of buyer's remorse as you question whether deviating from the norm was the right decision (the shrimp) or if you should have just relegated yourself to your usual Friday night agenda -- couch-ridden, half-watching some horrible movie on USA and wondering whether the bottle of Charles Shaw or the tub of Haagen Dazs will reveal a view of its bottom first (the petite filet).

But, a glimmer of hope presents itself.  In the time leading up to your date (entree) you happen to meet one or two other folks that run in the same circle of friends (the bread, a Ketel One martini) and they seem nearly perfect so you're feeling a lot better about the upcoming fate facing your heart (stomach).  The wait also allows time to conjure up images of your dolphin-riding, lingerie model fantasy date (jumbo sauteed prawns overstuffed with fresh, lump crab meat).

Finally, the day (meal) arrives.  Your date (entree) shows up and...total dud (total dud).  The doctor is a nurse's assistant who saves dolphins by not eating tuna; and the model? she's helping introduce VS's new line of Spanx muumuu undergarments (5 large shrimp that may or may not have had some crab hidden within the heavy breading atop a pool of white cream).  You try your best to find the silver lining, like the security of being with someone that will be able to change out your bedpan as your life nears its expiration date or being able to [honestly] say that you're dating a model (the vegetables were good), but disappointment still lingers heavily at the table.

I'm not one of those Yelpers who typically bemoans not having the ability to leave half star reviews, but in this case I'll make an exception.  It was better than A-OK, but not quite a Yay! 3.5 for great service, drinks and bread/butter.

I came here on a Thursday evening with two girlfriends for a late night dinner.  Not very many people in, so they were very accommodating, and sat us immediately.  We started off with drinks.  We each had dirty martinis--so good!  The blue cheese stuffed olives (order extra ;)) were a beautiful compliment to the perfectly shaken martini.  The table bread was warm, crusty, and delicious.  We ordered the baked goat cheese marinara as an appetizer; it's served with garlic toasted crusty bread.  Delicious!  I swear I could eat the whole thing.  

For entrees we ordered the porcini crusted rib eye (medium rare), the shrimp george, and the vegan chicken marsala (yes--they have a vegan menu and it's pretty sweet!).  We all shared, and everything was great, particular the shrimp george.  It's stuffed with crab and served with a lemon butter sauce, veggies and rice pilaf.  Very tasty!  The porcini crusted rib eye was also very good--not the best I've ever had, but definitely satisfying.  I love the fact that they had a vegan menu.  One of my girlfriends is vegetarian, so it's great to find places that cater to her peoples ;) And I'm not gonna lie their vegan menu ain't half bad!  The vegan chicken marsala was DEE-lish! 

Our server was prompt and sweet.  He noticed it was mine and my girlfriend's birthdays, and he brought over chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  If I weren't so full, I would have polished this off haha! But yeah, it was definitely a satisfying evening.  The bill came out to approximately $50 each, with tip included.

Crabcake $11.95

Swordfish with caper beurre blanc $22.95

I am just amazed on how well many have rated this place.  For half the total bill I would have thought about coming back but for over $100 for dishes we shared, this place is not grand enough to make it a worthwhile option with so many other places to try.

So while we didn't have any issues, we weren't thrilled either.  I expected better."}

Tonight though i had them deliver dinner because they do offer delivery and was pretty disappointed. I got the brushetta, the pot roast and the chocolate cake for dessert (all for my wife and I to share). The brushetta bread was burnt, the actual brushetta was literally soaked with balsamic vinaigrette so it was pretty mushy and the pot roast looked like it might have been sitting around a while because when we got it the gravy had already cooled down and looked kind of like a jelly substance. Now I know that none of these problems would have happened had we gone in to eat at the restaurant, but I feel like we were taken advantage of because we were not sitting inside the restaurant and they knew that we would not be able to send the food back. For reference, I live about a block away from the restaurant so there's no way that it would've cooled down that much or for the brushetta to saturate in the vinaigrette. What they also fail to tell you over the phone when you order is that they already include gratuity so you don't get the choice on how much you get to give. Overall, definitely dissapointed in the food quality."}

I was seated immediately off the bar area in a room that cut off much of the noise from the happy hour crowd at the bar.

I was soon brought a small basket of house sourdough bread and two rounds of soft butter with spiced oil and vinegar--more vinegar that oil.  It was OK but the spices didn't add to the flavor that much.  I do appreciate soft butter like this that hasn't been just taken out of a sub-zero freezer and you have to use and ice pick to separate it and try to spread it on your bread.

I was brought iced tea quickly and a glass of water although not requested.  The server had a few specials to go over with me and then he let me look over the menu to decide.  When he returned, I ordered the kurobuta squash soup--the soup of the day--and the 14 ounce strip steak with bone on ordered blue.  I had a choice of mashed or rice and I went with the mashed.

When the soup was brought, he brought the pepper mill and ground fresh pepper to my taste.  The soup was good.  Nice chunks of squash rather than having it blended into a purée.  

The steak came at a proper interval from the time I finished my soup--read, I had enough time to check Facebook and have another piece of bread.  The steak was cooked the way I wanted.  It had char on both sides but was very rare on the inside, just the way I like my steak.  I wish I had a choice of a baked potato or fries instead of mashed or rice.  Steak and mashed potato doesn't make it as well in my book.  The small amount of vegetables was just perfect.  I didn't have to buy a side that would serve 3 people and left room for dessert.  

I looked over the dessert menu and I went with their rumchata bread pudding.  It was very good.  The bread was soft and had a nice cinnamon flavor from the topping.  There was no taste of rum which was OK with me.  It baked away and didn't leave flavor behind.

Service was very good.  My server was attentive and the table was cleared of dishes between courses quickly.

Triple George is close to a 4 star but I'd like to have more choice with the starch."}

We were meeting a few friends for a birthday gathering and he wanted to go to Triple George. We have wanted to try eating here so we were in. We had reservations and were seated promptly. We had a large group of 9 so I was excited to see how service would be. Always a good test for how you can handle things in my opinion. Drink orders were taken immediately and bread was brought soon after. Their drink selection is good and the orders were delivered pretty quick. They have the wine josie likes so that on the spouses side of things is nice. Most the table ordered a salad before the meal I had the ceasar salad Josie had the caprese salad. My Ceasar was a little bland, i expected the pop in flavor you get from a little pepper or the capers that would go into a Ceasar. Ceasar needed Season(ing). The rest of the table had a mix of the same one had the Beefsteak tomato salad he said it was crisp and delicious.

 Entre...I had the Fish n Chips, decided to keep it small since I normally finish the wife's meal. Fish was hot and fresh out the fryer. Batter on the fish was perfect. Not a fan when they over batter. Fries were seasoned nice. Not sure if Tarter sauce was house made but it was thicker than most that I have had. Coleslaw was perfect shredded cabbage and carrots just the right hint of vinegar and mayo if that is what they used. JOsie had the Ribeye with "Chef's Choice Sides" which means waitress not telling you how many choices for sides. From a time standpoint love this idea. Steak she ordered medium and it came more mid rare which in my opinion is the only way to order steak. Sides of Vegetable and Mashed potatoes. Steak had a perfect sear and great seasoning nothing overdone. If you read my reviews you know how I feel about pricey steaks that can be done at home better. This was a good price and done as good as I could have done. Potatoes were your average mashed but the Veg had good flavor.

 Around the table we had a fried chicken that was hot as ordered. He said it was good seasoned well but hot when he ate it. Filet response from one in our party said is was good and tender but more mid rare to rare again how steak should be done but he ordered medium. Most had steak or steak and lobster, all or most had same response to flavor and enjoyment that we had. A couple had the Ahi salad as an entre. One comment stated that 4 slices of Ahi over a pile of greens was not worth the price. I agree your going to give as an entre throw a bit more protein on the plate. 

We had a good time. Beverages were filled over again if needed. Waitress was very on top of things. Manager came by a few times to be sure we were satisfied. They did validate tickets from Downtown Grand valet so good there. We will go back i recommend if you have not been you should try it.

I checked in of course on Yelp and received 15% off one item. We split checks so we deducted from steak price. 2 others also took part of the Yelp experience."}

We sat in the dining room and its low lit and comfy. The service was excellent.

I got a glass of house merlot and it was not bad. Just wanted a few sips and it did the trick.

They serve big loaves of bread and butter before the meal and I did not try the bread but it smelled good. I asked for veg butter and they didn't think they had any. No worries I'm not a bread fan.

Hubby got the vegan ravioli which when I tried it was super good. Sauce was perfect.

I decided on the gardien "chicken" marsala. It was super duper yummy. The sauce on it was plentiful and the portions here...let me tell you they are huge. Lots of quick steamed crunchy veggies. Tons of rice (it was brown rice) and a large cutlet.

I'm really impressed and glad to have this little place Downtown! We are going back soon and I want to checkout a HH menu and see what is to offer.

Next time I think we are going to split an entree...wow!  :)"}

My wife had the spicy linguine with scallops and shrimp.  The shrimp were fine (a little over cooked) the linguine was tasty but the scallops were soft and uninteresting...they swore they were dry scallops but they sure tasted like wet( wet scallops are injected with a solution to extend their shelf life and lose texture).  I had a very tough Hangar steak that I should have sent back..over seared and black, their steak knife had quite a tussle to get through for a couple of bites.

Based upon the above I might come back for an appetizer but not for a meal."}

We wanted to avoid The Strip and it's super high prices, but we still wanted to be in a fun part of town. Triple George absolutely fit the bill! Papa H hadn't been to Vegas since the 70s and he wanted to see how much Downtown had changed. I made a reservation only a couple hours prior on Open Table on a Sunday evening for the five of us. Hubby dropped us at the door so we could get settled, but he had no problem finding a meter right across the street. We were seated shortly after we arrived and our hostess was kind enough to seat us where my in-laws requested. 

My in-laws seemed pleased with the drink selection and our servers were hyper vigilant about keeping all of our glasses full. 

After we placed our food order, a basket of heavenly soft sour dough arrived at our table. It was accompanied by two soft scoops of butter that sat in pool of sweet juice and seasoning. So good!!

Both couples opted to share a wedge Salad which they split for us. Very thoughtful! And the wedge had that crunch I was craving. 

Hubby chose one of the specials of the night - a center cut ribeye and a lobster tail with a side of mashed potatoes and the most enormous asparagus I've ever seen in my entire life. 

I opted for the lamb chops. I couldn't believe they give me SIX chops! It was covered in the most deliciously flavorful gravy and accompanied by mashed potatoes and a mix of roasted carrots and squash. The lamb was cooked to medium rare as requested. And because I had so much, I shared quite a bit with hubby. I'm pretty sure he ended up liking what I got more than what he'd ordered for himself. 

The mashed potatoes were definitely super buttery and amazing. The carrots were beautiful and simply seasoned. And this unique green squash had very nice, sweet flavor!

While the in-laws were too full for dessert, hubby and I don't know what that phrase means. So he got the Creme Brûlée and I got the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. His was the largest serving of Brûlée we've ever seen! It was served in a much deeper dish than we're used to, which provided the perfect ratio of custard to sugared top - this was the best Creme Brûlée we've ever had! 

My cake was smaller in comparison. It was petite, but had a scoop of ice cream equal in size sitting on top of it. While this ice cream wasn't particularly rich or sweet, the cake certainly made up for it!

We were so impressed by this place. It's beautifully decorated and has a great feel. I'd love to go back and try lunch sometime!"}

Before I move there, let me say my boyfriends filet and huge bake potato was delicious and my "chicken" stir fry from their 'Glegan' menu was absolutely fantastic and quite tasty! Their Glegan menu is a gluten-free vegan menu offered to customers with a different eating lifestyle and I've included a picture of the menu but now onto our below average service....

Once entered, our party of 2 was immediately greeted by the hostess and we were seated to the back right of the restaurant along the brick wall. We sat there for about 10 mins and never once were we greeted, not even offered water. My bf wanted to immediately move to the bar thinking we would receive better service but I held out a little longer but never once did any server look our direction.  At that moment the hostess came back to seat a new table and we explained to her our situation and wanted to move up to the bar.  She offered to grab a server but at that time we weren't interested in someone who wasn't interested in us so we moved.  Once we sat at the bar, she asked the bartender to take care of us and he said "I can't" while shaking his head no.  Then she, the hostess, took matters into her own hand and grabbed our drink orders and appetizer. She really was trying to make a bad situation better and we greatly recognized her effort and it kept us from leaving.  

After getting our drinks and salad, she told us to enjoy the rest of our meal and walked back up to the front.  During this time we had gone unacknowledged once again.  Watching every server and the bartender walk by us and not offering us help, menus still in front of us.  One server had asked if we were helped and I said the hostess was helping us but I guess further communication wasn't made within the staff, he thought that meant we were taken care of.  I watched everyone including the manager who I believed was made aware of our situation by the hostess, work and see how long it would be before we were assisted again. Finally I see the mgr motion to a server to check on us in which she came over and asked if we needed anything. She took our order and then passed it along to who would finally be taking care of us. 

Even though the servers were apologetic (we eventually had to explain to them how horrible everything had been) no one seemed to notice until we spoke out loud. The mgr never once stopped by and our full bill was presented at the end.  We were given a free glass of white wine bc the bartender said it was extra but I wasn't in the mood to really have it.  I was really looking forward to eating here, esp with their Glegan menu but I won't be rushing back. A place with these types of prices should offer way better service and not pawn off guests from one server to another....or be told "I can't". This city offers way too many steakhouses to choose from to have such an unorganized venue.  I will say again the food was delicious and Glegan Menu is an awesome touch."}

I found myself in this state of mind and arrived at Triple George with my buddy Omar (from Seattle). 
We sat outside on a beautiful spring evening and started to attack the menu with some appetizers. 
The fresh oysters were remarkably fresh: one almost thought that one was Oceanside.
The shrimp cocktail was delicious especially the sauce that accompanied it. 
And the mushrooms au poivre left you longing for more. 
Now to the main course. 
The chicken pot pie was huge but also with huge flavors. My buddy didn't think he could finish it, but finish he did. It was that good. 
I opted for a Caesar Salad with a cup of bisque. A superb combo. 
All this topped off with Davidoffs slowly releasing the smoke in a beautiful evening breeze. 
Last but not the least: superb 

UPDATE: July 14, 2018
Triple George delivers. This was my second visit in 2 months. And I was as pleased as the first time around. A wonderful surf and turf dinner. 
Bravo."}

I had the Crab Cake, Caprese Salad and a Sazerac Cocktail.

The Crab Cake was perfect! Crunchy crust, with almost all Crab meat and very little filler. The Lemon Dill Aioli and Frisee Salad added a nice flavor and the acid helped cut the richness of all that Crab.

The Caprese Salad was an interesting version of the Classic with Seasonal Tomatoes, Arugula, Mozzarella, Basil and a Balsamic Reduction.The Arugula added texture and a peppery bite.

The Sazerac was the only stumble of the day. It tasted too strongly of Absinthe. Like the bartender added a shot to the glass, instead of just rinsing it with the liquor. If the worst thing that happens during a meal is that my Cocktail is too strong... I can live with that!!! ;) 

Service was knowledgeable and friendly and they are wheelchair accessible. I will definitely be back!"}

I'm terrified of rats and granted it was outside and not in their restaurant itself but since that seating area was for the restaurant patrons there should be no rodent within the vicinity. Luckily my husband and I already finished our food. The mussel appetizer very good however I don't think we will be back because I don't like the pets they keep near the restaurant. Such a shame since before the whole rat incident I told my husband we might've found a new spot. What a disappointment! FOOD WAS EXCELLENT THOUGH."}

Con:  Service was odd... Staff is not trained properly.  My soup and my partner's salad were not served together and I had to catch the server to get the salad to the table so we could both have a course together.   Beefsteak tomato salad was cold tasteless tomato slices with bad dressing over a soggy piece of lettuce (are you kidding me?).  As for the entree, She advised me that they serve the Ahi rare.  I explained that I wanted the center rare, but the outside charbroiled.  She or the kitchen ignored that and I had to send it back.   It wasn't re-prepared the way I asked and I complained to the server.  The manager came over and I explained my legitimate complaint.  He was sorry, but offered no compensation (or understanding of Ahi tuna)  ... what was the point of him coming over to us?????  I understand that this happens repeatedly with other diner's reviews.

Con:  Kitchen staff is apparently not overseen by an executive chef.  Whoever is working there is not trained properly.  Oysters were just ok.  The bisque had chunks of lobster (or crab - not clear on that), but it had a film over it as if it was canned Campbell's and twice as salty.  Charbroiled Ahi tuna was never charbroiled and only the outer 1/2 millimeter was cooked.... the outside area is supposed to be charred and the center red... that is every chef's way of preparing it.  Shrimp George - crab stuffed shrimp - we needed a search party to find any trace of crab... and no broiled, but soggy!


Con:  Atmosphere was a sports bar ... not a 4 star restaurant as some odd food reviewers gave it.  We spent $120. only to be disappointed in every aspect.

I could go on and on, but you get the point... read the reviews of people who are used to better dining experiences.

Recommendations: Don't expect what the menu professes to be fine dining - NOT SO!  No value for your dining dollar.  Stay away."}

The appetizers were blah.  So, by the time our dinners came out (after about double the time we would expect), we were hungry and ready for some great food!   Neither of us was happy - neither her with her chicken or me with my steak.  I won't go on about each, but as an example of our disappointment:  half way through my poorly seasoned, overdone steak, I turned it over and saw what you see in the photo.   No steak, no matter how well-done (mine was supposed to be medium) should look like this."}

My idea originally was to go to a cheaper place and not do our one nicer meal in old vegas but it just worked out that we ended up at Triple George.  I knew Triple George from yelp and steak seemed to be the way to go, so I was looking forward to a great meal of red meat.

It was a Sunday, but it was packed (yea for 3 day weekends), we couldn't get a table so they sent us to the back bar.  Now usually I'm not a big fan of sitting in front of a keno screen, but hey, with no reservations and last second decision to eat here, at least we got a spot.  The bartender was very busy but really nice.  Service was a tad slow but again, the restaurant was completely full and the meal made up for it.

My girlfriend got a scallop pasta dish and I chose the rib-eye for myself....wow, what a damn good steak.  We had great conversation with a gentleman next to us and savored the great flavors of the food, I hardly noticed anymore the fact that we had this little bar table setup hanging halfway off the bar with flashing video poker in front of me.  Triple George is a very, very good steakhouse and really for Vegas the prices are very reasonable.  If you want a good cut of meat in downtown, Triple George is a great choice."}

We have heard this is where the mayor like to have his martinis so we figured it had to be good. We had an early dinner here last night (Saturday, Aug 8) and weren't disappointed. All the entrees come with the sides and are figured into the price which was a nice change. I had the bone-in ribeye and she had the filet mignon. I don't think they were prime cuts of meat, not like you get at Rainwater's, but they were cooked well and had plenty of flavor. The salads were okay, nothing special. The drinks are definitely where I think this place earns its street cred. I had a Sapphire martini that was easily one of the best I've had in a long time. Not sure what they did different than most places but it worked! The bruschetta was also very good. The place has an old school Vegas feel that is really nice. It's definitely a place that will be worked into our rotation when we visit Las Vegas. The only drawback really is parking. It's on a one way street that only has valet but in the end that's not really a big deal."}

The atmosphere is dark with a long wood bar -- exactly the type of decor you'd expect in a classic "old boys network" bar.  If you want to have a martini in a suit--this is one of the few formal places in Vegas that might fit the bill.  There are very few t-shirts and shorts here.  Call it the Vegas professional's happy hour bar.

Beyond the professional drinking spot, Triple George offers a nice classic steakhouse menu.  They offer numerous lunch specials, ranging from some creative salads to classic chicken and steak sandwiches.  For dinner, the place is a little more like a classic steakhouse (oysters, salads, steaks, and mashed potato options).  

Basically, it's a classic American bistro restaurant and one of the more formal atmospheres in Vegas.  Thumbs up."}

I ordered a cup of clam chowder and the entree Chicken pot pie. Wait. Stop. Prepare yourself.

The pot pie is like a whole pie! 
Those other yelpers who noted that their portions are huge- it's really, really huge. 

When my "cup" of soup came, it was in what other places would call it a bowl. I had to ask and confirm that I ordered a cup. The guy says, "yes, this is a cup". Boom, mind blown. I should've realized at that time that my pot pie wasn't going to be the normal size. You definitely get your money's worth. Okay, enough about portions. 

The clam chowder wasn't bad. It has bacon bits for those that do not eat bacon much (like myself). It was tasty, however, ever so slightly on the salty side. B+

Their bread was great, I LOVE warm bread. The butter and olive oil + herbs mix were interesting but worked out. A

Chicken pot pie- Loved how they baked the crust to perfection and it really seemed like a pie. You soon realize that the puff deflates when you poke it. Relief! The flavoring is on point, super creamy. My only complaint was I felt disgusted with how much butter/oil they used... and it was pooling inside my pie. I had to scoop it out onto a plate, but it just kept coming from different sides of the pie when I took another bite. It would've been an A pie, but definitely a B- with the amount of oil.

Service was great, food took a while but our party was big. Overall, I would come back to this restaurant... just skipping the pot pie.

Also, they do have a "glegan" menu for you vegans and gluten free people."}

My husband and I had a reservation for Valentines Day and decided to go with the special menu they were offering for $99 a couple. 

Items ordered:

-Bisque of Love (lobster meat)
-Be Mine Cocktail (shrimp cocktail) 
-Bow N Arrow (twin stuffed lobster tail w/mashed potatoes/asparagus) 
-Fall in Love Duo (lava cake/ice cream/chocolate covered strawberries)

All of the food had good flavor but I was not a fan of the mashed potatoes. They were a bit too runny for my liking, they didn't taste fresh, and kind of tasted like instant mashed potatoes. The lobster was on the tough side. I really had to get in there with my steak knife, at one point I thought it was going to fly across the room because I was being so aggressive trying to cut into it. The dessert was amazing but by the time we received it, the ice cream on top of the lava cake was already melting and had formed a pool of ice cream on the plate. I did not get full off of the dishes we ordered. We went someplace else to eat afterwards. Price vs. amount of food was not justifiable. I should have stuck to the regular menu. We could have had a better, cheaper meal.. 

Our server Brenda was really nice. My husband ordered the beef tartare without knowing what it was, shame on him. He refused to eat it when it was brought out and Brenda was kind enough to switch it out for the shrimp cocktail, she was very attentive and friendly throughout the entire meal. I will be back again because I really want to try the pot roast, but until then they get 3 stars from me because of our very friendly server and great atmosphere."}

Nice icy cocktails refreshed the palate before the meal. Plus guinness on tap. Good solid comfort food. I had the pot roast and my friend the bbq baby back ribs. Both rapidly disappearred. Supposedly it is the lawyer hang out in town for power lunches because of its proximity to the court house and a few prominent law offices. Decor is quite cool.

The atmosphere is great, and the drinks were good. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer, calamari, and french fries. The calamari was chewy and overcooked, the sauces were just standard marinara and didn't taste homemade, and the goat cheese was average. The highlight was the french fries. For the main course we ordered a chicken dish, a small fillet, and the ahi tuna. For a high-end restaurant there were several problems that we encountered with our meal.  The sides on our dishes all came cold or lukewarm at best. The ahi tuna was low-grade meat, and very tough.  The fillet was good, and the chicken dish was tasty. When we told the waiter about the tuna, he just apologized but did nothing else.  We did not order dessert and left.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, but it didn't make up for the less-than-great food."}

If you know Tadich Grill in San Francisco since 1849 you know Triple George Grill.  The restaurant is just a half block from the Mob Museum just off Fremont Street.  Just follow the crowd to the place and enjoy.  As soon as you walk in to  Triple George Grill you know, somehow you know,  you are in for a real experience.  The menu was diverse including a great variety of menu items, sides and appetizers.  The fried chicken is one not frequently found in any restaurant - give it a try for sure.  It is so hard to recommend a single menu item.  What I suggest is to get there at 1100hrs for an early lunch, stay to drink, then in no time it's time for dinner.

Take the time to relax and enjoy a wonderful Manhattan cocktail.  A cocktail to sip, enjoy and take your time with your spouse or your friends.  We will definitely go again and again and again.

Restaurant was good, but nothing special, and not something I think we would return to..  Prices were very reasonable for what we had.  Certainly nothing negative by any stretch, just nothing special enough to make us go back downtown.

We sat outside on a beautiful spring evening and started to attack the menu with some appetizers. 
The fresh oysters were remarkably fresh: one almost thought that one was Oceanside.
The shrimp cocktail was delicious especially the sauce that accompanied it. 
And the mushrooms au poivre left you longing for more. 
Now to the main course. 
The chicken pot pie was huge but also with huge flavors. My buddy didn't think he could finish it, but finish he did. It was that good. 
I opted for a Caesar Salad with a cup of bisque. A superb combo. 
All this topped off with Davidoffs slowly releasing the smoke in a beautiful evening breeze. 
Last but not the least: superb service."}

This guys comes to apologize but doesn't even offer a free dessert for the table or anything which is ridiculous for this expensive ass restaurant not to at least do that. Seriously worst experience ever here. Food definitely isn't worth the price, the environment it loud and annoying because it's just groups of loud drunk people who have no respect for other families trying to enjoy a meal together. Managers don't say anything to them because it's a large party paying more. And the waitress kept spilling water when she would pour and leave the table wet on top of it all. There are way better steakhouses  for less. Check out Echo and Rig steak house instead if you're in vegas! Cheaper and the meat is the best tasting you can find!

I made a reservation for a girl's night with my sister and some friends. I had heard amazing things about the food so we thought we'd get dressed up and give it a try.

We called on our way to let the staff know we were running a few minutes behind, and were about 5 people less than we anticipated. They were fabulous and made sure we didn't lose our spot in the process. Kudos to the ladies up front. They were great.

When we were seated we immediately got to looking over our menu. I have a dairy allergy so I had planned ahead and read the menu online. On the website they offer a vegan menu, so I happily chose the ravioli in advance, as a dish I don't normally get to eat. When our waiter (Cameron) arrived we were all prepared with our choices, and even ordered an appetizer. I ordered the ravioli, even though the vegan menu wasn't presented to us. Someone ordered a steak, and one of our friends ordered the chicken alfredo, with an addition of shrimp as well.  As the waiter took each of our orders, he asked if we wanted a house or ceasar salad. We were excited for our food. 

About 10 minutes later I received my salad, bread and then a (very unprofessional) tap on the shoulder.  The waiter was there to let me know that the vegan ravioli are not available. But they had a meatless chicken marsala, a meatless chicken bruscetta and a meatless burger. I let him know that I am allergic to dairy, but I do eat meat, so I'd rather see the regular menu, if possible. He kind of just stared at me like I had a few extra heads, and then moved to grab me the menu. When he returned, he hovered while I made my selection. I explained I would like the lemon herb chicken, but I would need it made with oil, and not butter, if that's how it's made. Again the waiter looked at me like I was crazy, so I added, "Please tell the kitchen staff I have a dairy allergy, no worries". And again he stared. And he said "Well you can't have mashed potatoes, no can you." (You see the menu doesn't tell you what the sides are, only that they are pared by a chef). So I told him no, to which he replied "So veggies and pilaf then??". And I said that was fine.

Then we waited. More than 45 minutes came and went. No appetizer, no water refills, no checking on us, nothing. Our food arrived and our friend's dish did not have both chicken and shrimp. It had just shrimp. So we explained to the expeditor the issues, and that we never received out appetizer. We explained that we weren't mad, just wanted to make sure that these items were not on our final bill. The expeditor said he'd let our waiter know. A few moments later the waiter showed up with a manager and they apologized for the mix ups, though the waiter did not seem very sincere. 

We finished our meals and our plates were cleared pretty quickly. The waiter came back and seemed much more sincere. He admitted that he had just plain forgot to input our appetizer. He handed us a desert menu and let us know we could pick one desert on the house. We excitedly started looking over the menu...
...
..
15 minutes later, we had to flag over the waiter for our check. We let him know, while the offer was nice, we now had to go, so we did not want our free dessert. He insisted that we take it to go. We explained that we could not trust that we would get it quickly, and thus, only wanted our check. 

A few minutes later the check was dropped on our table. And to my absolutely disappointment, I found our salads for a fee on our check. The waiter never explained that we were paying for salads. We each ordered our entrees and then the waiter asked "House salad or ceasar?" We were led to believe that was part of our meal. So we flagged down a manager. We explained the situation and he stated "The salads have a price on the menu", in a condescending tone. Salads have a price everywhere. That way if that's all you want to eat, you can order that. Such crap. So he stated if we wanted, he'd take the salads off, and walked away. And then, from behind our booth, he handed our check back and said "HERE". And upon inspection, our of the salads remained. We paid it. But only because we'd had enough.

We didn't tip. We don't even feel bad about it."}

The last two times my husband and I were in Vegas, we stayed in the Downtown area. A good friend working on the strip recommended this restaurant. A block away from the Fremont Street Experience, you get away from the crowds to enjoy great food, atmosphere and fun. 

The first time we went in August, the managers noticed we were new and introduced themselves. I was under the impression the restaurant itself was new as this is a tactic you see when new places open. Not the case here. Triple George has been around awhile and the managers always try to notice who walks in the door! 

As self-proclaimed fanatics and my own twenty plus years in the biz, we love sitting near the kitchen to get the feel of the place, see the flow, enjoy the way the restaurant and staff make the flow happen for all the guests. I was certainly NOT disappointed. From our vantage point, we could see into the kitchen, around the large bar/ lounger area and into the dining area. We were treated to an entire evening of attentive service, excellent cocktails, fabulous food, near perfect timing, and the joy of watching truly seasoned staff in their element of harmony & flow through out. 

We started off the evening with martinis - shaken to the point of the ice chips floating on top and made to our specs - barely a hint of vermouth and for me the slightest bit dirty. Not being a huge martini drinker, this was very good and very well done. We chose the goat cheese/ marinara appetizer. This was very tasty and the accompanied bread was toasted nicely. The only complaint on this I would have is it is really too big for just two people. The goat cheese was warmed just enough to spread onto the bread. We could have had this as our dinner. Each of us had salads. Being a bay area organics snob, I am always leery of the freshness of produce in other parts of the country. Here I was not disappointed. Each salad - iceberg wedge and Cesar, were fresh and crisp, definitely not day old produce here! Bacon bits on the iceberg wedge were not processed but made in house as was the blue cheese dressing - not heavy creamy, but complimented the blue cheese in the dressing. The dressing for the cesar was also fresh made in house - not overly salty as I find many to be. 

The main dishes were great - rack of lamb and the special of the evening. I cannot remember the exact name of the special from back in August. If I do I will certainly update. The temperature on the rack of lamb was perfect - medium rare. The cut was definitely high quality as the flavor was excellent with no gamieness to it at all. The accompanying potato and vegetables were very tasty and not over seasoned at all. The special of the evening was a stew of three meats - lamb shank, beef, and pork. The stew was a coq au vin style with onions, carrots, potatoes and mushrooms in a dark wine sauce/ stew. The meats fell off the bones and were so tender and delicious! Again, huge portions of food but very tasty.

I will always make it a point to go to this place when we are in Vegas!"}

I was even able to make a reservation by text message although I think a walk in would have been seated as quick.  For people visiting Las Vegas, get off the strip.  Check out the old and established section of Las Vegas. Less crowds, older established places, and a classier experience!  Three George's fits the bill."}

I had the special of the day- perfectly done halibut over a bed of rice and julienned vegetables with a sauce. The sauce was a little thick and a little too sweet but it did complement the dish. My wife had the spicy shrimp and scallops with a cream sauceand linguini. She asked for less spice and it was dialed back.  Bread was good and was served with a sweet butter and balsamic.  The bar has a selection of draft beers.  Service was on the mark. An enjoyable night out in a neighborhood feel spot.  The bar looks great!"}

It's a short walk from the Mob Museum. I wouldn't recommend Triple George Grill for a special occasion.

We decided to eat at Triple George Grill in downtown Las Vegas to celebrate a birthday since they have a Vegan menu. We made reservations and were seated promptly and immediately noticed the noise level. It was 6:30pm on a Saturday night and the noise level was above average. The restaurant is very classy looking with a huge bar in the middle. Everything is made out of dark wood: the bar, the booths, the floors- which makes a normal level of noise seem louder. 

There are 5 items on the Vegan menu: Grilled vegetable platter, Gardein chicken marsala, Gardein chicken bruschetta, Ravioli (in a spicy sauce) and the Vegetable Vegan burger. I had the ravioli, my boyfriend had the vegetable burger and the others in our party ordered from the regular menu. Everyone was happy with their food. The ravioli was filled with a tofu ricotta, covered in a spicy tomato sauce with lots of vegetables. The vegetable burger was good, but I think the white truffle oil fries were the best part of the dish. 

We would definitely go back, just not for a special occasion."}

We read about the sea salt caramel martini they serve there, and being Scandinavians we love everything salty.  We came around 10 in the evening and noticed the nice atmosphere at once.  There were dining seats in a horse shoe around the bar, and seats by the bar if only drinking.  

We got our martini quickly, but it was made properly by a professional and nice bartender.  She somehow reminded me of Sandra Bullock and we had a nice chat on how Aria hotel has the best scent there is.

So, salty caramel?  Omg,  I would loooove to have another. Now!

Will come back in a year and have dinner also."}

The service was probably the best that I have seen in a long time. In the time that we had drinks, appetizers, and dinner, the wait staff checked in on us almost 20 times.

We started with drinks and an calamari appetizer. Then we moved on to dinner for 2, I had pot roast and Marcia had the hanger steak. I don't think that I have ordered pot roast in a restaurant before, but after reading all the tips for the pot roast, I decided to try it, and it was amazing. I would strongly recommend trying the pot roast. The hanger steak was good. Its is not often that when you order medium rare, that you actually get medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly. 

Our both was almost like a room of its own, and is great for an intimate dinner for 2, or for a group of 4.

The total bill for 2 of us was $74, and worth every penny. There was no disappointment here, next time I am in Vegas in the Fremont district I will certainly return to the Triple George Grill.

Remember... try the pot roast."}

With that being said they don't look down their snout at you for coming in in your pool attire! Stopping by after going to the pool is a must for us. It's a plus that their happy hour goes until 7 p.m. As most of them in Freemont Street area only go till 6 p.m. And if you like to hang out at the pool until all of the sunshine is gone then the later time is ideal. I like the goat cheese appetizer and my wife really likes the fish sliders. It's very high quality food at a very reasonable price you can't beat this place! And Shelby was very attentive and professional as was everyone that talked to us. And it's always been that way every time we've went in. We're definitely going back soon to have lunch or dinner!"}

Not only did they not disappoint, they actually exceeded my expectations! Upon arriving, we were taken through the bar area to the back dining room it was very classy, and definitely a bit on the classic side but not stuffy. The service was impeccable, the meals enjoyed by our group included the chicken saltimbocca, meatloaf, the specialty bone-in filet with shrimp, and cioppino. Every single one of us found her meals to be delicious and cooked to perfection. For seven of us the bill came out to $230 plus tip, granted only a couple of us in the group had an alcoholic beverage so that kept the bill low. It was a real pleasure, and since we come to Vegas a couple of times a year on business, I can say with great confidence that we will be back, it was definitely a group favorite. One tip, when I tried to make the reservation online it said that there were only spots available for a group at 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. but when I called they easily accommodated us at 6:30, so I suggest you do that."}

First time the service was a little slow, but it picked up. Here's the rundown:

#1 experience:
I ordered the Brussels and chicken. The server asked me if I wanted vegan chicken. We all laughed because "vegan chicken" is such an oxymoron. I told him to bring on the real stuff and out came an EXTREMELY generous portion of chicken and Brussels sprouts. I couldn't finish it all. I had been warned the Brussels may be a little crispy (some people apparently complain), but I thought they could have been even crispier. I like them a bit charred. 

#2 experience:
Co-worker had just landed and the rest of us had already eaten, so we accompanied her so she could eat. She loved her dish (fried chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies) and I had a glass of wine with some passion fruit mousse. The wine was a C (not the restaurant's fault) and the mousse was really good.

#3 experience:
Lunch again. This time I had the chopped salad with chicken. Again, a huge portion. It was very good and really liked the balsamic. Colleague and I split a crème brûlée - very good.

My favorite is their bread and the butter/olive oil they serve with it.

Would definitely recommend and if you need a place for a business lunch, this is a great choice."}

They had a Valentine's prefixed menu but we're also serving the regular menu as well so that was good. We orders the crab cakes and the shrimp cocktail. The cocktail was pretty basic with nothing special about it. The crab cakes were really good but if you order them make sure the order extra sauce with them cause it doesn't come with enough on the plate. For entrees we had the signature Shrimp George and I had the recommended Pot Roast. The shrimp entree was amazing with a lot of flavor. The pot roast was also really good but heavy and rich as pot roast is. After the apps, bread and heave meal there was no room for desert. It's located in a very odd place in downtown Las Vegas next to a pizza place and a biker bar so if you find your self trying to find it and are surrounded by drunks getting pizza and bikers you are probably in the right place. You can valet at the grand hotel and the restaurant will validate your valet ticket. I would of given this place a 5 star except there were 2 big parties (one on each end of the room) that were so loud and obnoxious they were were ruining our experience. Hope this helps . Enjoy!"}
