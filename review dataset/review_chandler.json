We almost started crying as we dream about Tott's and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food.

I sure hope they open back up (maybe in Goodyear???). :)"}

Everything here is so delicious and fresh. No MSG and the best part, gluten free options! They offer multiple rice noodle dishes and if your a fan of spicy food as well, this is your place. My husband even loves it. This spot has become almost a weekly Sunday tradition. We've had the: Spring rolls, pork rolls, egg drop soup, Tom Yum soup, hot Korean stir fry, mushroom stir fry, the red curry,  green curry, yellow curry, bourbon chicken, crab puffs, chicken wings, and dragon noodles. Since we've tried just about everything on the menu, I can say our favorite dishes are the green curry, hot Korean, dragon noodles and both the spring and pork rolls! GO HERE!"}

Our go to order is Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken (it's seriously award winning!!). If you choose to go in and dine, the people that work there are so friendly. It's just a great family operated business. The pricing is amazing too, very fair and far less expensive than other "faster food" restaurants."}

Stopped in when we were nearby, hungry, and saw Tott's has a great rating on Yelp!.  Nice restaurant with a good pace of customers and very pleasant staff.  Dessert options were a step above the norm at a small diner like this, which is useful when you have little ones like my wife and I.

Food is good, but not great to my tastes.  The Hot Korean is semi-spicy and would do better with bamboo versus the carrots and more chili pepper.  My wife had the Pepper Chicken (name?) and thought it was tasty enough, but some pieces were warm while others were cool.  Dumplings are not meaty and are more veggie... and the sauce is a sweet vinegar thing that doesn't give much appreciable flavor.  Our daughters thought the Terriyaki Chicken was too dry to finish.

Pumpkin Roll was yummy.  Almond Cookie Cheesecake was left half-eaten as my wife said it tasted more like orange mixed with cheesecake.  I took a bite and have to agree."}

We tried the crab puffs which we all agreed were the best we'd had, the wonton and egg drop soup came out so hot and had more than a few peas in it like most other places, the walnut shrimp was beautiful and creamy, the Mongolian beef was a favorite and the mushroom stir fry was chock full of veggies. We also did the teriyaki chicken, sauce was a little sweet but ok because it came on the side anyways. I had the lemon chicken which was a bit flavorless for me and came with broccoli, chow mein noodles, brown, white or fried rice ( your choice). The portions were huge and we took a ton home.

Ordered a Thai Red Curry. Didn't even smell good. So you can imagine the taste. No lemongrass or nothing Thai about it. It tasted like a regular Curry with Curry powder. 
Dragon Noodle, tasted like wax.
Called the restaurant & told them about it immediately. They didn't seem to bother about it. Just said they will let the Chef know. 
We had to get Burgers & that was our dinner.
Before you start cooking food from another region you should first learn the taste. Taste it from other restaurants & then match it.

Their food was good.  Started with pork lettuce wraps which were fair.  Continued into Dragon Noodles, which were quite spicy, but the flavors were not melded well, and the wide rice noodles absorbed the moisture quickly.

The orange chicken was good.  The Kung Pao Beef was very good.  The Walnut Shrimp was probably a little too sweet for my taste.  Steamed rice was fresh, fluffy, sticky but not too sticky.

Overall a fair restaurant, and if you're in the mood for fast casual Chinese in that area, I would definitely choose there rather than the other fast Chinese restaurants that are right around there, and choose Tott's over Pei Wei."}

I phoned in an order for the orange chicken, extra spicy and the tofu curry, unfried.

The guy on the phone said their tofu is only fried.  OK, so this pretty much means they buy the tofu already fried and don't cut it up and fry it themselves... 

When I got home (3 miles away) the food was luke-warm.  The orange chicken appeared to have been prepared by dumping 1/4 cup of red pepper flakes into the sauce.  There's no veggies with the orange chicken, and it didn't taste any better than any other random Chinese place.  The steamed rice was dry and slightly hardened, another disappointment.  

My girlfriend had the tofu curry which was ok she said, nothing special.  

Inside the store it was all young people who seemed polite.  

Really, it was nothing to warrant even 2 stars in my opinion.

So far, we've tried . . . 

1) Orange Chicken 
2) Dan Dan Noodles with Beef
3) Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry 

The Orange Chicken is great. Much better than Panda Express, but that's no surprise. However, for those saying this is Chandler's best Orange Chicken? Sorry kids, but that title is reserved for Tokyo House's Orange Chicken on Alma School and Warner. It will blow.your.mind! 

The Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry could have been a little spicier. 

The Dan Dan Noodles are perfect! Tender beef, and just the right amount of spice in the garlic bean sauce. Always ask for some extra cucumber.

While I did get a student discount, my meal came out to be around $14 for cheese puffs, walnut shrimp, and brown rice.  I suppose it's a pretty standard price but here's what it breaks down to:

- Standard cheese puffs with very little cream cheese.  The scallions were a nice touch though.
- An incredibly small portion of waaay overly-battered shrimp with plain mayonnaise based sauce.

They have an open kitchen area which can be fun if you like to watch the food being prepared, however I found it odd that while I saw food being prepared I didn't smell anything. I am used to walking by a restaurant and being tempted to enter because of the delicious smell of the food they being prepared there. I went to the counter and ordered the orange chicken they seem to be famous for. The total was $6.82 which seemed reasonable. I sat down and was quickly served in a matter of a few short minutes.  My dish was served on an oval shaped platter. The orange chicken was on one side and the other side was a large helping of white rice. The dish had large pieces of chicken sitting in a large pool of orange sauce. The orange sauce had many pieces of red pepper flakes and other spices I couldn't identify. There were five or six large red and black peppers to add some spice to the dish. The chicken was not over breaded like you might expect from places like Panda Express, but the sauce was overly sweet. The sauce seemed to have a thicker consistency to it like a syrup. The five or six large peppers were a welcomed relief from the sweetness of the dish but they ran out fast. The spices and pepper flakes in the sauce didn't translate into flavor on my tongue. Im usually a big fan of orange chicken but was very disappointed in it overall and would not order it again. The owner was there and seemed very friendly, thanking every customer as they left. I saw some other food being prepared as I left and I can tell they were making an honest effort to make good food here. I saw that they were roasting their own peanuts, for example, instead if just opening a package of ingredients and tossing it in the mix. Unfortunately, my experience today didn't equate to the dining experience I had hoped for. It was just way too sweet and lacking flavor."}

They had an assortment of noodle dishes you can order from all over:  Japanese, Singapore, Korean, Hong Kong, Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Bangkok, and Malaysian styles to name a few.  Lots of reasonably priced appetizers and curry dishes.

We ordered during dinner with appetizers so it was over $10 a person, but their lunch specials are generally around $6-8/person.  We had Pork Roll (YUMMY!! I recommend this!!), Tom Yum Soup (tasty, but we won't order it again), Lemon Chicken (Yummy for the many tender cubed pieces of white meat chicken.), and the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodle (HUGE bowl of dry curry noodle.  It was good :) ).

One more thing, if you're looking to try this place out, it's next door to Starbucks."}

The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere!
This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order. 
1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork.
I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry "panang" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces.
I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's.
Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license."}

I phoned in an order for stir fry Mongolian beef with brown rice.  The order was ready upon my arrival so there was no wait time. The guys at the counter were friendly so no complaints about customer service. 

However, I was somewhat disappointed in my Mongolian Beef as it was extremely sweet. It was full of tender slices of beef and lots of veggies but entirely too sweet for my taste buds.

We ordered 3 plates of orange chicken with steamed rice and fried rice and also 2 pork egg rolls. The total came out to around $31.00. It was the most DISAPPOINTING Chinese food we have EVER tried in our entire lives. It literally made all of us sick to our stomachs after forcing ourselves to eat at least half of it since we paid for it. It was very very dry and the meat was extremely chewy. I had to chew it 100 times in my mouth because I felt like I would choke if I hadn't. The taste was stale and the fried rice was rubbery and lacked flavor. I do not recommend this place to anyone.

She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.

I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.

First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.

There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here."}

The owner was extremely accommodating and allowed us to sit on the patio and eat on real plates versus to-go's and told us he'd be there cleaning and finalizing some things and to take our time.  I am in sales and have a keen sense of customer service and was thrilled to learn that Tott's Asian Diner not only delivers fresh, great tasting food, but exceptional service too.  Keep up the great work!  We will definitely be back!"}

And what is it supposed to be?  Asian fast food, dine-in / take-out.

And why is it perfect at being that?  For starters:

- excellent recipes, delicious menu, lots of variety
- top-notch ingredients (no fatty meats & bright, crisp veggies)
- very generous portions (the dinner portions = 1.5 to 2 meals)
- clean (including the restrooms)
- friendly staff (managed by Yan (Yun?), the owner's brother-in-law)
- the Bourbon Chicken, Twins Pork, and Dan Dan Noodles (yes, they deserver their very own bullet point)

The first time my fiancee and I ate at Tott's, it lasted for 3 days.  We went on a Sunday and ordered the Bourbon Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles with Beef.  They were so delicious, but the portions were so huge we got to eat the left-overs for lunch the next day.

Of course, when dinner rolled around, we were dying to try more of the Tott's menu...so we did.  The next day?  Repeat.  Pretty much nothing but Tott's right on thru Tuesday.

Yan, the manager, is a very friendly person, who obviously cares about the restaurant.  He takes the product and the service very seriously.  I'm sure he's a big reason why this restaurant is so spot-on.

I can't believe this place has been around for four years (as of this writing), and I've only just now discovered it.  If you haven't discovered it yet, do yourself a favor and order yourself some Bourbon Chicken asap.

Check out the web site (http://tottsasiandiner.com/section.html) to see the menu and pricing.

Did I mention the Bourbon Chicken?"}

I remember going to Tott's back when it first opened on McClintock and Guadalupe years ago. I ate there on their second day of being opened and I have loved the place ever since. They had to move locations due in part to a Pei Wei opening up literally 100 yards away in the same shopping center. Besides location, nothing has changed with this wonderful place. 

The food is really great. I would say Tott's food is like Pei Wei's except it tastes better, they have larger serving sizes, and there is a lot more choices on the menu ;) The service at this place is excellent. If you appreciate a business where they make an effort to get to know you and remember your name you will love Tott's. 

Pros:
- Awesome service
- short wait times
- great food
- great selection
- large servings
- very competitive prices

Cons
- not much seating"}

I was super sad when they moved- because the owners of this place are genuinely nice and want to make you happy. It's Pei-Wei style restaurant, where you get your own silverware and such, and the owner and even staff would walk around and take your plate if you were done and even refill my drink. Very friendly.

I get the orange chicken like so many other people- and it's delicious. My favorite part was me and my friend COULD share a meal because it's so much food. But we'd get our own, and then take home half for later.

The pad sew ew noodles were al dente, which I like, but some may not like their noodles that tough. The pad sew ew had carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, celery, green onions, and white onions in it."}

We thought that PeiWei would do the trick, some kind of noodle something or other. Turning into the parking lot too early though had us passing this place, we yelped it and seeing its solid four stars after 40 reviews, we had to try. 

Tott's does not disappoint.  The menu is actually pretty similar to Pei Wei with one outstanding factor, the owner of this place came out and talked to us, him and his family own and run it.  They've been there for six years now he says (2 before Pei Wei).  Pretty messed up that the property owner would put a second Asian diner in there.  Pretty messed up that Pei Wei would try to exploit a mom and pop shop's built up following.

Tott's still thrives he says, and thrive they should.  Service, ingredients and preparation are outstanding here.  The menu spans several nationalities, from Chinese to Thai to Japanese.  Pretty basic stuff but great if you have a craving for any of those, and easy to suit many palates in one place.

Lady had the Hong Kong noodles.  Wide noodles with cabbage and bok choy.  Wonderful flavor here, kind of a grill taste.  My choice was Udon noodles with beef as well.  Noodles were very soft and the fermented beans that made the sauce for mine were very flavorful.  Neither dish was particularly spicy, but both had great flavor.  Definitely better than any fast Chinese I have had in the valley.

Great atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food for very cheap."}

The second time, I ordered to go.  Orange shrimp.  I couldn't decide between it and the Singapore Rice Noodle plate, but ended up going with Orange Shrimp.  The sauce was pretty sweet, but the shrimp was crispy and not too spicy.  The chow mein was decent too, but not many veggies.  The Spring Rolls were pretty good - nice and crispy.

Usually they're  so terrible with food that it'll knock you on your back faster than a kick to the face.

Tott's proved me wrong. So wrong that I came back the day after I ate there. Everything i've had has been really good, but I have an addiction to their orange shrimp. The perfect level of spice, the crunchy golden shrimp, and that godly sauce...sorry. I need to clean up my keyboard now. The walnut shrimp was really good, the bourbon chicken was nice, the stir fry is good, and the lo mein was excellent.

Wait. All this praise and it's only getting 4 out of 5? Okay, their fried rice isn't all that great (tastes pretty flat) and the won ton soup has some pretty weak won tons. 

The portions are huge though and it compensates for the flat rice. If their fried rice was as good as any other chinese place, i'll happily edit this and give them five stars. The owner is really nice though and is always thankful for your business...so my final score is a 4 1/2 out of 5."}

It had mushrooms, green beans, green and red bell peppers and tofu in a curry sauce.  The sauce was not too heavy, but enough to coat the rice a bit.  

The best part, however was that I called it in to go.  I asked for my curry to be very spicy and the GM (referenced in my earlier review) made me promise that I had enough water at home.  Cute and hilarious.

The menu has a good mix of various Asian fare, i.e. Chinese, Thai, Korean, etc.  There are a good number of spicy choices so I was happy.  We ordered wanton soup, Tom Yom soup, spicy stir fry with chicken and Singapore Noodles with chicken.  The wanton soup was loaded with veggies and shrimp (4) but tasted "fishy" to our son.  He only ate the wantons and a bit of the broth.  The Tom Yom soup was huge with tomatoes, tofu and shrimp.  It was very red in color which I'd never seen before.  The broth was somewhat thick, but very tasty with a good hot and sour zing.

The Singapore Noodles came very quickly as did the spicy stir fry.  Both were very generous portions, enough that we took some of each home. The noodles had just the right amount of curry flavor and the chicken was tender and tasty.  I'd ordered my stir fry extra spicy and I wasn't disappointed!

Overall we were very satisfied.  The price was very reasonable, food was good, staff attentive, and restaurant was clean.

My only criticisms are that the main courses came immediately after the soup so we had it all on the table at once and there was too much tofu in the Tom Yom soup."}

I opted for the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodles with Chicken. 

Portion Size? Plentiful.

Price? Inexpensive, slightly more than chains (e.g. Panda Express).

Taste? The chicken was overwhelmingly dry and the vegetables were bland. The seasonings and noodles were average.

Of course, there may be dishes on the menu that they do a better job with but that would involve making a lucky pick. With so many Asian options in Chandler that specialize in a particular cuisine (strictly Thai or strictly Chinese) it makes it hard to justify a return visit."}

I usually go to Pei Wei whenever I'm feeling in the mood for some quasi-Chinese food, but I'm pretty sure this spot is going to take its place. My first time here, I ordered take out and low and behold, I was actually shocked at the portion size of my dish. I had fried rice filled to the brim of a Chinese to-go box and the Kung Pao shrimp was in an entirely separate container. They didn't skimp on the shrimp or the veggies. It tasted extremely fresh and was super flavorful. 

My second time around, I got the lunch size portion (which still lasted me two meals) of Mongolian shrimp. It was out of this world. Absolutely incredible. I definitely recommend this. 

What takes the cake for me, however, are the cheese puffs. They are absolutely INCREDIBLE and I would go back just for these alone.

As a test, go to Panda Express and this place, order the orange chicken and have someone taste them both. You will see that there isn't a difference in the taste. 
I expected more from this place but the food is just your basic frozen food cooked in a wok...or microwave. I will say that my wife the lemon chicken and it tasted like it was cooked, left out, and then reheated, you know it had that "reheated" taste. 
Unless the reheated taste is just the taste of the food and in that case it's just bad.

The service I guess was nice. 4 people on staff at the time, all were standing around talking. One guy was standing in front of the register playing jewel craft and he didn't acknowledge I was there. A girl took my order after shooing the guy away so she could enter my order in the register.

We also got pot stickers and they tasted like chemicals found in cleaning solution. My only guess for this was that they were sprayed on accident when someone was cleaning but it ruined them. They were also still raw and very under cooked. One was still cold in the middle.

If you want really good Chinese food, I suggest going to China Palace instead.
They are always nice and helpful. I like their orange, sesame, and lemon chicken and it has a nice crispy taste to it, not soggy like Tott's.

Overall, if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you."}

The menu at Totts seems to have a significant vegetarian menu, but eater beware that here, fish sauce, shrimp paste, eggs, and CHICKEN powder, is considered vegetarian.  You are best off asking for a "vegan" option.  ( I think there is only one).  

I think I eventually got  the Spicy Szechuan with tofu/veggies. The portion was huge, the veggies were fresh.  It tasted ok. The restaurant is clean. The server / host staff was very nice.  The owner, I am truly disappointed in. 

I got there, ordered what I presumed was vegetarian (asked if sauce had shrimp/fish paste -they said no).  Afterwards, I asked if the curries had fish/shrimp paste, and she said yes, and asked if I had an issue with animal byproducts, because the dish I had ordered, has CHICKEN powder in it.  Apparently they consider Chicken powder to be vegetarian.  Fine, whatever, we have different definitions. I appreciated that the woman went back to grab my ticket / ask if I could get the dish without it / what I could get instead. 

Next the owner came over to me, and got really upset!  All I asked him, was to clarify what on their menu, did not have any animal byproducts.  His response was that your people come in here all the time and have different definitions of vegetarian.  This is my restaurant, and yes, here this is what I call vegetarian.  Fine, I'll agree to disagree on the definition of vegetarian, but by no means, as the owner should he have YELLED at me for inquiring what he considered to be vegetarian / what they had that did not have animal products in it.  

If we had not already paid, I would have left.  

So while, the place is clean, staff was nice, food was ok, the owner/GM was outright rude, and had extremely POOR customer service.  For that I go out of my way to write a review, give you a 1, and tell ALL OF MY VEGETARIAN friends to avoid your restaurant.  

Thanks for the unpleasant experience."}

Also comes with a separate container full of noodles for take away.  Finally,  my son loves the Yellow Panang Curry.  Great veggie selection and plenty of whatever protein you choose to put in it.  He gets angry when I eat his leftovers on this dish.  Don't feel sorry for him as he has eaten more than his fair share of my leftovers while I toil away at work!

Do yourself a favor and go to Tott's for the best asian food in the valley that falls into the category somewhere between Americanized Asian food and "real" Asian cuisine.  Now, I am going to get in my car and travel through this horrible rain so I can get me some!"}

I saw the menu on the window and liked what I read. I went inside this place it is small but very clean. The tables were wiped down and shiny, there was dishes and condiments on each table.  I had the Salt and Pepper Crispy Chicken and asked if I can substitute the rice for steamed veggies. The gentleman said yes. My total was $8.00 and I took my order to go and waited for a few minutes until a gentleman walked over to hand me my bagged order which had soy sauce, napkin, fork, menu, and a fortune cookie. 

The taste was really good and spicy. I will return to try more of their dishes. I think it's say better than Panda Express flavor wise and less expensive than Pei Wei."}

1) the pad thai (sp?)
2) bourbon chicken

and i don't recommend the walnut shrimp (unless you like eating a whole jar of  mayonaise dumped onto shrimp)  perhaps it would be wise to ask them to leave the mayo on the side and you can add as much or as little as your gut can handle.

the service is friendly and the place is as clean as the starbucks next door.

what's cool is that they offer brown rice and i don't recall them charging extra for requesting it (take note other nickel-and-dime you to death restaurants)!

although i have to make a note of a time when we were there a half hour before closing.  the kitchen crew was soaping up the exhaust hoods and everything else while customers were still coming in to eat.

luckily (?) we already had our food at our table but who knows, mebbe we were eating tilex chicken too!

i guess that's the cons of having an open kitchen...the customers get to see the good, the bad and the ugly."}

I have not been eating here when I have easy access to it. I remember when I finally went in there this past Saturday, that I had stopped by this place when I first moved to Arizona and really wanted a smoothie-but I think all their smoothies had dairy so I just left. A really nice warm environment-still totally a quick lunch place, but I still felt comfortable coming here at night-and judging from the full tables of ASU hipsters feeding each other tofu on dates, so did they.

I mean, the staff knows what is in all their dishes and I asked for the Tofu Yellow Curry with no fish sauce added in with rice which came within ten minutes and it was so good. Not very complex, but there were plenty of vegetables in it for once (not the usual onion and sad little pepper swimming in curry) perfectly sauteed and the rice was so good I kept eating it by itself instead of pouring the coconut in it.

I also really liked grabbing the fortune cookies before we sat down and we opened them up while waiting for the food, and like naughty children got to get another one when leaving. I had a huge take-out container and I kept thinking about that huge white container sitting in my breakroom fridge. If I was a cartoon character, it would be a series of panels doing a variety of activities while a big fluffy thought balloon of Tott's yellow curry."}

I'm very picky when it comes to pork fried rice (it depends on how the pork is cooked) and thanks to so many helpful Yelpers posting pics of their food, I was able to see that it was exactly what I was looking for. 

My boyfriend had the orange chicken which came with a side of fried rice, while I obviously went with the pork fried rice. The portions were great and we had food left over for the next day, however my rice was just a tad bland. I added a little saracha and soy sauce to give it some flavor and it helped quite a bit; next time I will make sure to ask for the rice to be cooked extra spicy. We will definitely be back (especially since this is about 5 minutes from our place) due to the generous portion sizes, perfectly cooked pork and very friendly staff."}

Hubby had the Orange chicken. He loves orange chicken and fried rice together but the rice felt was not complimenting the chicken.

This place is amazing because of the food and the very friendly customer service. The food is delicious and does not leave you with that " i ate so much, i need to throw up" feeling. The food isn't dripping with grease like most asian places.

The owner is such a nice man. I came here often when I was pregnant and everything sounded so good, I couldn't stop ordering. The owner (who i call Mr. Totts) would tell me to not order so much because the servings were so big. LOL who does that? He made me stop spending money, I appreciated that.

This was a first visit and as reported by other yelpers, the manager greeted me with a smile and affable chit chat about my 4 different chicken dishes! He made me feel like I was the only one there and he was happy to be of service. What, I ask you, could be bad about THAT?? 

We tried the Bangkok curry, orange chicken, bourbon chicken, sweet and sour chicken [mainstay for the kids] and the potsticker appy. Large portions all, I gotta say I loved the curry as I am a total curry suck-up; but all of the others were really good. Of the non curry, I'd say the Bourbon was my fave. Potstickers and sauce were deevine. Could have made a meal of just them and probably will on a return trip.

Wonderful orange peel flavor and was brought to our table in less than five minutes after being made fresh to order.  My wife ordered the Korean style chicken with the medium spicy sauce which was also cooked to perfection.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend this jewel in the rough and am looking forward to trying the wide selections of dishes offered."}

Pretty darn good! I haven't found many great Chinese restaurants since moving to AZ back in 2000 but I enjoyed this. Orange chicken with noodles and egg drop soup. Both where big portions and flavorful. 

Food is made too order and very fast. Love the smell of the wok cooking!

And trust me, no matter what dorky haircut you have under that cap, it is infinitely sexier than looking like that guy.  Luckily, my food arrived before I yanked the beanie off Marky-Mark's head.

Maybe all the thai food has just destroyed my taste buds so thoroughly that all inferior asian cuisines are rendered tasteless.  Or maybe Tott's just isn't all that good.  I had the orange chicken with brown rice.  A more accurate description might read, "I had the carmelized sugar chicken."  It was so sweet that my stomach began to ache as I finished my 6th bite.  I had to leave my food unfinished.  Not because I was full but for fear of diabetes.

On the plus side, it's clean, fast, and the staff seem quite friendly."}

The menu is suprisingly deep and diverse, the quality of the ingredients and preparation are top notch, and the resulting flavors are delicious.

All the "Stir Fry Your Way"s are delicious.  I haven't made it to their curries yet, but I'm expecting greatness here too.  But one real standout is their Orange Shrimp.   It might not be the healthiest thing on the menu, and of course it tends to the sweet side, but it's hand-battered, and let me tell you, the breading is out of this world.  I don't know what they do to make it so rich and light at the same time, but the magic works.

This is not a large place and I sometimes wonder if I'm going to have a place to sit, but it's never failed me or my family yet.  The proprietor seems to always be there and I think his son runs the counter much of the time.  They're both wonderful hosts and they seem to have set a tone of friendliness and helpfulness with the rest of the staff.   It's a really nice, but no-frills atmosphere with really excellent food.

To me, tacos to Mexican food are like chips to a sammie: you might get a taco on a combo plate, but the reason you ordered the meal was for something bigger and better. The taco? It's just a little more than a condiment. That said, I have no idea what drove me to order the 3-tacos (ground beef) w/ rice and beans on the side, but I think I was hoping for an unlikely gastric event -- a really tasty taco.  I won!!!  Crispy tortilla that was consistent throughout, and the remaining shell held its molded structure and didn't shatter like broken glass when you took a bite. I like that. I also appreciated that the taco was filled w/ meat, more so than lettuce, cheese and tomato. I like my taco old school, and the ground beef was flavorful and not dry.  The aforementioned dressings were chilled and fresh. Crispy, tasty goodness. I should have ordered 3 more!

The rest of the meal? Not too shabby. I liked the refried beans, but the rice was really salty. Also, my buddy grabbed the salsa (well, it was more of what I would call a "red sauce"), so I don't know if there were multiple options, but I prefer a chunky salsa over a sauce. Still, it had a good flavor and was not overpowering as a condiment. Guacamole was okay, and the portion of the side order was plentiful. Regrettably, I found the chips to be a tad over done, and too thick for my liking (I enjoy a lighter chip, cooked in fresh oil).

All in all, a really good meal, complimented by friendly service. I'll be back for the tacos . . . 

Cheers!

I got the carne asada burrito and added guacamole and cheese. They did not add the cheese that I paid for, but the quality of the food was excellent. This is the reason for the 4/5 stars. Had they put the cheese on I would have easily given them 5 stars. Burrito, additions and a medium drink was $10 on a Friday. They have specials.... like Taco Tuesday... I'll be back for sure."}

Great, authentic Mexican food that was served with a smile and very quickly.  We had the good fortune of sitting by the owner (or one of the owners).  What a great guy!  My son and I felt very welcome and we were invited back to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  We live an hour away and really wished they had a location close to us (Anthem - hint, hint).  

Do not pass up the flour tortilla chips! They come out warm and are addicting.    I had the carnitas plate which was very good (and spicy!) and my son really enjoyed his taco burro.  

Will definitely visit Espo's again when we are back in the area."}

Today we finally stopped.  We orders enchiladas, taco, tostada, chips and chirps to taste a bit of everything.

Price per person: average $10 
Meals:  served with Refried beans and rice and topped with light lettuce and tomatoes
Service: order at cashier
Food quality:  score 4 out of 5 as the ground beef was very greasy and the tortillas shells cooked were mushy and burned on the bottom.

I was given a replacement meal for the burnt bottom.

A few things to consider:

- The rice has tomatoes and onions for those who are subject to fussy.
- ground beef is relatively greasy "but" flavored well.
- Red salsa is basically HOT sauce and I was not able to eat any of it.
- Green chili (sauce for meals choice) was mild to most but still spicy for me, you can ask for light or on the side.
- Excellent $2 margaritas.
- if you want extra containers to take stuff home there may be a charge.
- bathrooms are outside and unisex.
- probably can't go wrong with taco Tuesdays.

Over all I think it's a good "find" and has something to please everyone, even me who can do spicy."}

If Espos wants to be great talk to your customers!

I love ground beef and it is seasoned just right! it isnt full of extras like potatoes or tomato sauce just simple ground beef and it is amazing! The Carne Asada is grilled just right and also season perfectly. Refried Beans are smooth and full of flavor and paired with fluffy rice round out the plate perfectly. The hot sauce is has just enough spice and compliments the food and adds the perfect amount of heat.

Not sure we will ever return again though unless in area and it's convenient. Ordered 4 bean burritos, all without cheese and 2 with pico. Two burros broke open upon first grab, after waiting 20 minutes for our order. Granted it was a Sunday at around 1pm and busy, had to wait to ask for extra tortillas to double wrap tortillas and by time done fixing the busted open burros my burro was cold, and then broke open as well. Beans tasted authentic and bonus for vegan friendly (no lard yay) but made for a sad dining experience that was meant to be a treat out for birthday."}

First off I love eating at Espos and have been for many years. This review is not meant to bash them but to make others aware of what happened to me. The food itself is actually one of my go to for takeout Mexican food. 

On Friday November 24th my family was over so we ended up ordering takeout from Espos which equated to about 8 plates of food with chips and salsa. 

Everything tasted great as usual from Espos. We were not able to finish all the food and a untouched beef Enchilada combo plate was left over. I decided to take the untouched combo plate for lunch at work on Monday. During lunch break when I was about to take my second bite. I noticed a large screw inside the shredded beef. No joke pictures below. 

I was not upset but concerned for others chipping teeth on metal. I contacted Espos and the female on the other end said they were missing several screws from a device used to cook or slice tomatoes. After describing the screw she apologized to me and offered free food. My goal wasn't to get free food and frankly was not hungry for Espos at that time. 

I wanted to warn them about the metal and potential injury to customers. Sounded like they were aware of missing metal screws and she told me it was not just one screw but several. 

In talking to the female at Espos I asked her if she wanted me to bring the screw in. She said she would really like that. The next day I took it to the restaurant and asked for the manager. The female cashier said the manager was busy and I showed her the screw. This was the same employee I spoke to over the phone and  told me the manger was upset and never took down my name or any information. 

Even though I love the food it's disappointing that it happened."}

Tostada: 5 stars...lots of fresh lettuce, cheese, and beans.  Would order this again.
El Jefe burrito: 1 star...Booo!  :(  It is Carne Asada with green sauce + cheese + pico.  It was waaaaaaaayy too salty.  Neither my husband or I finished it.  Would not recommend this even though the cashier did.  My husband said he'd give it a 2, but I'm writing the review so...
Portion sizes: 4 stars...large

All in all, I may go back for the bean tostada and salsa.  Nervous to order more meat given the salty carne."}

I stood in line & paid. Then I sat down directly across from the register & waited. As I started hearing order numbers called off I took another look at my receipt to make sure I wasn't going crazy, sure enough my number had not yet been called & the new numbers were steady getting larger & larger (than mine). The young lady behind the counter said nothing to me until I stood back on line to cancel-she must have sensed my agida when she said 'Isra, I see her wrapping your order now - she had to re-make it' 
I grabbed my order & when I arrived home was really annoyed to find that my enchiladas were flat & food was not secured in its packaging. The top was loose & had shifted into my food!
I'll have to see how I feel about visiting again because my tolerance for poor customer service is really low. The food is good but not worth this kind of hassle - I waited about an extra 10 minutes after I called ahead. What sealed it for me was the hostess lack of attention until I stood up to get ready to leave - she totally could have said across the countertop, 'hey they had to re-do' or any number of things... we'll see what happens going forward."}

Beats the heck out of the other "Mexican" restaurants in the area.  Served on paper plates and tin pans but hey it's reasonably priced and tasty!  Good quality ingredients.  Better than the sit down Mexican restaurants in the area.  They do have outside and inside seating so it's not a take out only place.   Nothing to dislike, its all good."}

I have been back three times since they had their grand opening.  Very disappointed.  Thought I would give them one last try.  I ordered their grilled chicken taco and their carnitas taco to go.  Got them home and opened them up.  I would not even give it to my dog.  They have done a lot in cleaning up the place, but the food does not compare to what it was like before they closed.  Would not recommend it to anyone."}

We had carne asada, carnitas, tamales, rice, beans, salsa, guacamole and queso. Everything was delicious! The queso was the best we have ever had with the right amount of spice. 
We have been to the restaurant a few times for lunch. It is usually busy especially on taco tuesday, prepare to wait a little bit in line and to find a seat. You can sit outside but with the AZ heat many people sit inside where there is only about 7 tables. The tacos are good but spicy with their pico de gallo, so I usually get it on the side. The tortillas usually fall apart which is a disappointing mess and thats with meat and pico only so not much weight inside. Many people get burritos which look awesome so that might have to be the go to from now on."}

It was a busy Sunday afternoon at Espos but the line moved fairly quickly. 

We had the El Chapo burro and the carnitas burro. The El Chapo was filled with green chile beef, potato and cheese. I loved the green chile and the spicy kick to it which was about maybe 6/10 on the spiciness scale for me. The potatoes were a bit mealy tasting though and I would have liked an extra texture such as the addition of onion or pico de gallo to contrast with all the soft textures of the burro. The carnitas was decent, filled with slow cooked pork. The pork was moist as if it were cooked in a pot rather than roasted or fried like how I've encountered other carnitas in other restaurants. 

The shop is pretty small with a few tables inside and a cute patio outside with more tables. 

Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'd definitely stop by again to try more off their menu."}

I am on the hunt for good Mexican food, I haven't found a good place yet here in AZ. I would think it would be easy but sadly this place wasn't that good. I had a basic crispy chicken taco and my husband had a carne asada taco. We shared some rice, beans and chips and salsa too. The meat was bland in the carne asada, no seasoning at all. The chicken wasn't grilled like it says on the menu and the crispy taco was so soggy from the chicken juices it all fell apart. The rice and chicken was super salty and I am usually the person who salts stuff and this was way to salty for even me. The salsa was bland and no flavor a other than a red chili taste. I would skip this place if you are looking for good Mexican food, this isn't worth the energy."}

Went on a Saturday night, party of 5. This is a order at the counter and they call your number. Place was busy and line was out the door most of the time. We were excited because the reviews were great and had high hopes. 

My girls had a quesadilla and chips with melted cheese and salsa. I specifically asked the guy if the salsa was on the side because and he said yes. The quesadilla was huge but I was disappointed that my other daughters "chips and cheese" had jalapeños all over it. She's four and will not eat that so we picked it all off instead of sending it back as the line was still out the door.

Two of us ordered the taco salad with ground beef and it was just ok. Wish we ordered sour cream and guacamole because it really had no taste. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas, 2 ways. Both green and red sauce was good. I munched off his plates. 

With the order comes a huge bucket of chips but I wish they gave it to you when you order and sit to wait for your food. We did not touch any of it and felt bad for wasting a whole bucket of chips. 

We tried ordering the fried ice cream but they said they didn't have it and they needed to take it off the menu. Not sure if they no longer will be serving or just out for the night? We ordered the churros for a sweet treat after we were done and it was the best part of my meal. 

Tons of Mexican restaurants around so I can't say we'll be back."}

Today I placed an order and had to wait over 40 minutes for 3 breakfast burritos. When I asked to speak to the manager, the girl behind the counter responded that no one was there, and no one could help. 

It is really frustrating when you place an order ahead, and not only to be forgotten about, but completely neglected. When we got the food, it was overcooked and tasted horrible. It was clear they rushed, since they likely forgot about us. (The girl told me three times the food was being wrapped up.) I will be reaching out to the owners for a full refund. IMO you can get a better breakfast burrito at Adablertos. BEWARE!"}

We took the leftovers home thinking maybe the flavors would intermingle and be more evident the next day......nope still bland and lacking taste. I know I know, some of you are probably saying "oh well you're probably a smoker and your taste buds are shot." Nope, have never smoked a day in my life. 
   Cute atmosphere and pleasant staff but this was our 1st and last trip, food tasted literally like nothing. But they must be making some people happy as the line was out the door. Prices weren't terrible for amount you get......but dang, my taste buds were sad heading home."}

I decided to hop on over to Chandler to try this place out for dinner.  I am sure there are better places, or maybe not, but how often do you get personal restaurant recommendations from a local 1,200 miles away .

I got:  the Machaca, carne asada and carnitas tacos; the green chili beef chimichanga; and a cheese and Machaca enchiladas.  I have nothing but positives to say about the food.  The cashier was a bit short with me, but I can't blame her.  Being new I was as quick with my order as possible, but that was probably pretty slow and this place was slammed most of the time I was there.  Mostly with to go orders.

I am sure I will be back because I do enjoy their food when it is correct and their Taco Tuesday but GEEZE, please pull it together Espo's! 

Signed,

A very dissatisfied, loyal customer."}

Tired of looking for good Mexican food in a place that should offer it on every corner, we often don't bother anymore. Espo's, as you will read in their Yelp write-up, existed for 40 years in this same location until some time back and then was reborn this last year. We found it a few months after its re-opening and it was packed with a variety of folks, many of whom had apparently just found it as we had. Yesterday we were there again and noticed how many of the patrons were of Mexican descent--a very good sign. The food is the best you'll find for 20 miles in any direction and very reasonably priced. I tend to stick with what I like, so I can only directly speak for the tacos and the chimis. Staff is super-friendly, vibe is warm and cheerful and decor is simple old-world rustic. And they now have beer! Great outdoor patio seating."}

Tried 4 different types of tacos. Now these are street tacos, small tortillas, but they are very generous with the meat portions. You help yourself to the condiments.
Everyone was very pleased with their choices. My favorite was the carne asada.
Salsas were tasty, chopped cabbage fresh.
Iced tea was fresh brewed.
Counter service, they call your number. Everyone was friendly.
Pleasant patio was full, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.
What a great place, can't wait to return."}

Rice and beans were okay I could have done without.  Each state makes beans and rice differently so I wont hold it against them.  Wifes burrito was also good super tasty pork with green chili's."}

We ordered chips and salsa, horchada, carne asada plate, and the red tamales - all for about $20.

This place was never a fancy place to eat, but this restaurant near the corner of Chandler Blvd and McClintock has always put out great Sonoran style Mexican food.

The menu is geared towards spicy and hearty beef and other meat items. Burros stuffed with stewed beef and pork and enchiladas topped with fiery red or green chile sauce dominate the menu and should not be missed. Cheese crisps and tamales are also great. They also understand Christmas style.

I had to have my red tamale plate with a taco like usual. Taco Tuesdays are in force with $2 street tacos and $2 beers catering to the ASU college crowd. The red sauce was as hot as ever making this gringo sweat big time, and I loved every minute of it.

Food is served scalding hot making take out much easier than eating in the basic restaurant. Service can get slow, but the food is worth the effort and the burn!"}

I have now gone 3 times and each time, I have been disappointed.  The first time I went, I had a carne asada taco that while flavorful fell apart because it did not have a very substantial tortilla.  And what they call flautas are what everybody else calls taquitos-nothing special here.

On the second occasion, I went for Taco Tuesday.  Upon entering, there were two people ahead of me and I noticed that all the employees were eating lunch.  Not one person bothered to get up and take the orders. We had to wait  a good 5 minutes until the girl was done playing with her cell phone to order.

I ordered a ground beef taco and when it arrived, I saw that they didnt even put lettuce or tomato in it.  It was simply ground beef in a tortilla-that's it.  There was a salsa bar but I was not too impressed with the flavors of the salsas.  My other tacos were alright-nothing amazing.

On the third occasion, I ordered a beef machaca chimichanga.  While it came with sour cream and cheese, they didn't even bother to melt the cheese on the chimichanga.  I honestly have had better chimichangas at Garcia's-which pains me to say.  Oh, I also had big chunks of gristle in the meat. Yuck. Yuck . Yuck !

My son wanted to try the flour tortilla chips, but neither of us liked them at all. I think corn tortilla chips are the way to go. The salsa was given a thumbs up by my son though.

I really just wanted $1 tacos - which are only $1 if you get the 10 taco deal, and It's $1.50 if you don't. They also have a 3 tacos plus a drink for $5.00. I think the best deal in the house is their margaritas ($2) and beer buckets (5 bottles for $10). 

Parking was pretty packed when I arrived (not the smallest of parking lot either) with 2 open lots. Entering through the gates, I can see why this place brings in a crowd on Tuesday. On the patio, they play lively Latin music as everyone enjoys their drinks and food. The line was not too long - the friendly staff works fast to get orders in, but getting orders out took maybe 20 minutes (not a bad time considering how packed it was). Getting a table was hard as well. You have to be ready to pounce on a table once it clears.

The food. If I wrote this review alone on just the food, and not considering the price, it would probably be only 2/5 stars. I had the mango peach fruit drink (pretty good, a little too watered down), 4 grilled chicken, 4 carne asada, and 2 carnitas. The tortillas are okay, nothing special. I personally like that they were not too soggy and didn't break so easy. I thought the chicken was going to be just GRILLED, but the final product was shredded chicken soaked in a broth. Carne asada seemed like it didn't get a good sear, and it possibly was rushed too quick or soaked in juice too long. Carnitas were the best, but I mean it's carnitas... always good - this one had nothing special to it. Lots of salsa and toppings to choose from; all were about medium spice. The lighter green sauce had more tomatillos sour to it, lighter red sauce has a stronger tomato base, dark red sauce is thicker with spices, and dark green sauce had a stronger hint of maybe oregano or cumin (was my favorite, especially on the chicken)."}

Being from the midwest what I know as Mexican isn't exactly the same as what I am finding out here in the desert southwest!   I was surprised to find so many "chain" restaurants and not as many authentic Mexican ones as I expected to be out in this area of the country.   Espos is a delightful little place to eat and I must say the food was exceptionally good!  It is nothing fancy, and somewhat small but the cooks know what they are doing when it comes to preparing Mexican cuisine.   I came on a Wed. around 1:30 in afternoon to miss the crowd, since I was alone.  You could tell they had been busy but the place was still well kept.  There are no floor servers, you go up to counter and order off of a huge wall menu then find a table.   They have EVERYHIING!!  I was so happy to find cheese dip! Not easy to find out here but all mex places back in Indiana serve it.  Didn't have to wait too long for my food.  I had the chicken/onion burrito with cheese dip and salsa/chips.   I was only able to eat half of it and took rest home.   The prices are very reasonable and most items are ordered "a la carte" style.    I am sure going to return here again in the future.   As the weather is finally cooling down I am looking forward to sitting out on their spacious patio,  perhaps in the evening sometime soon.

Same menu as before but laid out very nicely in the front of the restaurant. Same type of ordering process, order at the front, they call your number when your order is ready. It looks like they no longer have a liquor license which is no big deal to me and I don't think it will be detrimental to the business, the food speaks for itself.

I had two machaca beef tacos which were delicious. Espo's does machaca beef so well. The green chile beef is a staple here and great in both burrito form as well as chimichanga if you are being adventurous. Service was great.

Their taco Tuesday is pretty awesome. 10 tacos for $10. A bucket of beer bottles (I think 6?) are $10. We ordered 10 tacos, nachos with guacamole, and their cinnamon something chip things (THEY ARE AMAZING BTW) Your tacos will come w just the meat, so make sure you grab the condiments in the tiny little stand inside. 

The food was absolutely delicious. Explains why it's hard to find parking, seating, and the crowd. Well, I did go on a Tuesday ..... but nonetheless. OH. MY. GOSH. THIS PLACE IS THEEEEEEE. T.H.E. PLACE!!!!!! If you buy your alcoholic beverage outside, there's NO tax. So buy you drank outside.

I went on a weekday lunch with my grandparents and it was quite busy from the lunch rush. We did the lunch buffet which everyone else was doing as well. First of all, the service was friendly and quick. They refilled our drinks and took away empty plates quickly. The food itself was not the best, but it was good. I will have to go back to see if it was a one day thing, but the reason I decided to round down and give 3 stars only was because the meat dishes (especially the tikka masala) was almost without meat for the entire time we were there. I realize that it is a popular dish, but to not have it restocked was disappointing. Also, since there were so many people, the naan was only given in small amounts."}

Not only was the food delicious and fresh, but the staff were so friendly. Every single person was smiling and said hello to our table.

The young man (owner's son) who was there told us all the ingredients are sourced fresh and locally, and that they are all family recipes. I hate when people say that and you can taste a disgusting frozen, month old mess. Not the case at all here; EVERYTHING was tried tasted like it was made on the spot. We had the chicken tika masala, lamb vindaloo, samosas, a delicious Indian beer (Kingfisher), and the best damn pistachio dessert I have ever had. I HIGHLY recommend giving this new joint a shot; I hope they stay in business for years to come."}

This place is really good.  I liked every dish I tried and you could tell it was all homemade.  I got there right when they opened for the lunch buffet.  I got first dibs on all the new stuff they were bringing out and it was hot and fresh.  I always have a hard time remembering the names of most dishes, but they were all very good.  The chicken tikka masala was also amazing.  The spice level was perfect, just enough to make my nose run a bit.  I can tell this place has a strong grasp on spice use and levels and are masterful at bringing it right to the edge for buffet food that everyone can eat it and everyone will be pleased.

They fill your water as soon as you walk in and give you the option of plain or garlic naan.  I opted for garlic.  It's not as crispy as I'm used to, but it's still really good, and I think most people prefer the way it's prepared here vs. the crackery crispy type that I've had elsewhere.  This is strictly personal preference.

I spoke with the owner during my meal and he was very friendly and gave me a history of the restaurant, how long they've been open and their philosophy that "everything we serve here is what we eat at home".  It shows in their food for sure.  It's cool to have the actual owner tell you that his father is cooking for you the same thing he cooks at home for his own family.

The lunch buffet price is very reasonable.  Definitely go for the buffet to get a wide variety of everything.  They have a large selection, a nice salad section as well as several sauces which is very rare for an Indian buffet.  It's nice to have those sauces available.

My only one gripe.  My lady was unable to go with me on that day, so I promised to bring her home a dish.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala to go.  The owner asked me if I just want some from the buffet or they can make it scratch.  I opted to go with from scratch and asked for mild, since my girl doesn't need her food to be hot for her to enjoy it.  When he brought it out, it was a medium sized cup container of the entree, but there was no side of rice or naan bread.  Just the dish.  I don't know if he just kind of misunderstood what I was asking for, but I was charged more for the little cup of food than i was for the three plates (yes i had three don't make fun) of food I had at the buffet.  Maybe the owner can comment and I will switch to 5 stars if maybe I was confusing the way I ordered to go.  If not, I think this place would be perfect if they were to include a cup of rice and maybe a naan bread to make it worth the price.

The restaurant is clean and they opt to play Indian music with a contemporary twist, so you get a little something for everyone.  They keep the buffet very clean, they are attentive and fill your water constantly, which is good because this food can be spicy."}

We each ordered a side of basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was absolutley delicious and not too spicy. We ended the meal with the deep fried cheese dessert which was amazing. 

When you come across a place like this you want to tell everyone! There is a shortage of places to eat where not only is the service excellent, but the food is as well. They don't get all of these amazing ratings for nothing, so go check them out! I can't wait to go back!"}

Only downside to this restaurant was the service. Note to Manager: When a customer has been given their food, someone should come over and check that it is good BEFORE the customer has finished eating. I would have raved to the server about the food, but didn't get a chance. It's not like the place was busy - we were the only customers there.

It had some sort of "left over from a few days" taste. There was no "achari" taste to the lamb. I would say this dish/recipe failed. The Shrimp vindaloo had no vindaloo flavoring, again dish/recipe failed. Now the pricing, the prices were high for the amount of food provided in each dish. The only positive was the Naan, it was soft and good. Overall, I would say our experience with the food was - i have had better Indian food elsewhere!"}

It's very clean, and the setup is both open and airy. The service is appropriately personal and very friendly. Our server explained the menu options, and made sure my kids knew how to traditionally eat their dishes.  Unlike other Indian restaurants I've visited, New India Gate allows you to control the heat level on EVERY dish. This is wonderful, because I can't handle the heat and haven't been able to try dishes I wished I could! The most amazing part is my 5yo ordered goat, and LOVED IT! He hates every food his parents suggest, so I'm still amazed. He told us "this place got five stars, but it should've gotten SIX!" Plus, my other child kept murmuring "this is delicious" as he ate his chicken dish. I love this place, every part of it. The dad was cooking with mom, and the two brothers were servers. A+

(I was surprised to see any negative reviews, so went to read them. Every single one was a glowing recommendation - I'm pretty sure these guys wrote 5 star reviews, but didn't know to (or forgot) to choose how many stars to rate it! That means 100% of these reviews are positive!!!)"}

Wow, I was so surprised on many levels today when I accidentally came across an Indian place while doing errands.  We have been to hundreds over the years in many countries but not able to find too many in Arizona!  
Ordered to go:
Meat samosa - (accidentally gave us beef instead of chicken but it was better than most and have a great flavor on the outside which was a surprise)
Tandoori wings - tender and so flavorful, better than most we have tried anywhere including the "wing" place!
Mater paneer - (peas and cheese) mild, and it really was mild because I can't do spicy which eliminates a lot of places for me.
Chicken tikka masala  (mild again I can't do spicy and it was) ... wow, tender chicken breast and flavored.  Yup, one of the best butter sauces I have ever tasted.  And I love that is was not loaded with veggies because I like to dip my naan in it!
Basmati rice - perfectly cooked and tender.
Regular naan - (I prefer a little chewy and bendable to pick up food) and it was awesome.
So happy I tried this.
Service by the way was amazing.  Can't wait to do this again!!!!!"}

The service was great too. We sat next to what seemed like a difficult table and the server/owner handled them with such grace offering suggestions and detailed explanations. He even looked at another restaurant's menu that the customer pulled up to show her what would be similar on his menu. He was very friendly to us as well.

My husband loves the desserts. They have rice pudding and the heavenly doughnut like balls. There is even chai included in the buffet and it's so inexpensive for such a huge selection, $7.99 lunch buffet.  They have everything from two types of rice, entrees, salad, samosas, and dessert.

I'm so glad I did!

I ordered togo chicken tikka masala and an order of garlic naan-bread (no rice, still doing no or low carb!) As far as spice goes they have a variety of them, but this time I opted for Indian medium (I really thought my head was going to explode because I wanted something between medium and hot, but either I'm getting used to it, it's 108°F outside, or I'm not certain it was just that hot!)

The chicken tikka masala was fantastic, so much so I could have drank the gravy it's in! The garlic non-was a little less impressive but sure did make it fun soaking up the gravy I didn't drink (see attached picture).

I'm not certain when I'll be in the greater Chandler area again, but if I am and I'm in the mood this will definitely be my Indian goto spot. You've got to like a place that's only five months old but the love and care they show really comes through in the cleanliness of the restaurant as well as the food.

I did have a bit of a long wait for the order but people kept checking on me and I didn't really mind waiting.
The food was really tasty! You can specify the spice level, which I appreciated. I had medium spice, which was just right for someone who is kind of a spice wimp but still wants a little kick.
The naan was delicious, as was the saag paneer. 
Will definitely be back for the customer service, cleanliness, and delicious food! Might just dine in next time with the takeout wait time though ..."}

Limited options. Pakoras were oily but not crispy. All the curries were bland. Chicken teeka was like chicken pieces in red cream. Only thing spicy on the buffet was chicken biryani. Taste wise it was ok, but had an over cooked texture. The rice grains were smashed or broken with the chicken. For anyone who likes like spicy AUTHENTIC Indian food, this place is NOT for him/her. 
I would rate the food (entrees and appetizers) 2 star. That extra star is for service( which was great), garlic naan and gajar halwa. And yeah also for the price point."}

Sorry but I had to drop my 5 stars to 3 tonight, only due to my most recent order pick up experience.  I ordered a tandoori chicken, two breads, and qeema/beef samosa.  The tandoori chicken was almost raw/uncooked from the inside and the beef inside samosas was just nasty in simple terms.  It looked very raw as well.  I have no idea what happened here but the food tonight was very bad, which is unusual for this place.  

Tandoori chicken was not charcoaled whatsoever, it appeared to be boiled chicken dumped into some kind of a sauce.  I've had tandoori chicken at many Indian places but nothing like this, sorry I have to disagree with the manager.  Your tandoori chicken is NOT tandoori!"}

As a novice to Indian Food, I was a bit apprehensive that the buffet might be too spicy for my taste. I expressed my concerns to the waitress, and the manager (possibly the owner) ended up walking us through the entire buffet, dish-by-dish, explaining the ingredients in each dish, what to expect from a heat perspective and how to adjust the heat on-the-fly if it is too spicy. I'm not sure I've ever had a restaurant provide such a careful, detailed explanation of their food, and I was thoroughly impressed with their friendliness and desire to make sure I felt confident in making selections.

In terms of the quality of the food, I can't say I'm an expert at evaluating Indian food, but everything tasted really fresh and high quality, and they had a solid selection of vegetarian dishes on the buffet as well. I am a meat-eater, but the vegetarian curry was actually my favorite dish! Plus, if you go on the weekend they have an amazing mango pudding on the buffet (served Saturday and Sunday only)!

I'll absolutely dine at New India Gate again in the future!"}

I usally do not see Beef on Indian Menu's, however it is a nice addition and look forward to trying some of the beef dishes on the menu.  The service is impeccable and the two brothers running the front make you feel like family.  The atmosphere is very inviting and the place is very clean.

1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This place deserves its 5 stars.  Perhaps the friendliest service of the many Indian joints in the Valley.  After a few years hiatus, they're back, and I'm very glad that they are.  

I've been to approximately 10 different Indian lunch buffets in the Valley and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, on the whole, this is the best.  From variety to quality, it hits all the right notes.  The friendly staff adds that much more to the experience.  

I don't mind places that have bone-in chicken in their curries, but bonus points to this place for using boneless.  Their chicken tikka masala is excellent, as is their garlic naan.  I'm a sucker for kheer and their's is particularly good.  There's a great mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, complimentary chai masala also helps.

Until I find something better, this is my go-to Indian in the Valley."}

New plates, utensils, chairs, tables, menus.  You name it and it is new. Two knowledgable and loquacious brothers run the place.  They seat, take orders, bus tables, serve the food and answer every question about the eclectic menu that is thrown at them. The recipes, however, are the fathers. 

We decided to sample menu items other than the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala. We started of with the beef samosas. I had never seen the beef variety before.  All I can say is "WOW!"  Served with mint and tamarin chutney, the     delicately spiced ground beef was seasoned perfectly.  I would have  been satisfied to end the meal right then and there.   

Next was the Fish Pakora, they were tasty and made with moist white fish.  Nothing mind blowing.  For the main meals we ordered "Indian Hot" spice level. 

We ordered: Mushroom Matter (mushroom, tomato, green peas and spices),  Chana Masala (garbanzo beans and masala sauce), and Karahi Shrimp (ginger, tomoto, onion, bell pepper served in an Indian copper pan). I was craving super hot but I would equate it to a medium at a Thai restaurant.  The food paired really well with the fresh soft garlic naan.  I am definitely returning and bringing friends!"}

I always over estimate the amount of spice I like in my Indian food, so I may order the spice level lower next time, but that's on me. The amount of food you get for the price is good, even without the 20% discount right now. I am new to the area, and from what I understand the owners had a restaurant before and have recently moved to this location on Ray, but you can tell they have been in the business quite a while from their warm welcome when I arrived to their flawless execution of my dish and the dishes I saw when there.

After multiple trips to New India Gate, they have officially taken the crown away from Delhi Palace as my all-time favorite!

The buffet is fully packed with tasty offerings which, once the craving hits, has me coming back just about every couple of weeks.  At $9.95 for the weekend buffet, I truly feel that for the quality and quantity of food that they offer, you get more than your moneys worth.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is absolutely scrumptious every single time that I visit this establishment, along with the Tandori Chicken, tender and juicy with just the right amount of spice to it, the Vegetable Samosas, a crispy, flaky pastry filled with spiced up potatoes and veggies, and their rice as the base, which is cooked to perfection every time I visit.  The garlic naan has just the right amount texture and flavor to sop up alll of those incredible sauces on your plate to create the perfect bite.  These are just a few of the many delicious choices that keep me coming back for more!

Lastly, the dessert selection is the perfect finishing acts to send your taste buds into the stratosphere.  The Kheer is without a doubt, the best version of rice pudding that I've ever had.  That along with the Golab Jaman, little balls of milky goodness, various spices and sugar syrup just add to the symphony of flavors that this fine place offers.  Finally, the Gajar Halwa, their take on a sweet carrot dessert, which includes nuts and raisins, is just another home run that makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

Bottom line - if you've never gone outside the box and experimented with this type of food, the buffet at New India Gate is the perfect place to give your taste buds something new that they'll thank you for later.  If you've already tried out Indian food and are a fan of this type of cuisine, come to this place and see what all of the terrific reviews are about!  The family which owns the place truly show their love for the food that they're putting out for the masses and are extremely generous and personable.  Keep up the high standard that you've already set New India Gate, it's certainly working on yours truly!"}

I'm pretty sure that the rice was reheated leftovers (it was dry and kind of clumpy), and the raita is the simply the worst I've ever had. It was like a bowl of milky water with weird lumps in it. I overheard one of the young gentlemen owners tell another table that the problem was a lack of access to reliably good milk. That is the biggest bunch of baloney. Hahaha! Look, if you can't make a decent yogurt from scratch for your raita, buy yogurt. Given the choice between having to tell customers "Sorry, we don't have raita tonight" versus serving that mess, go with the former, please.
Now, on the upside, the rest of our meal was good, and the kitchen got our food out quickly. All in all, just based on one visit, I'd say that the "New" India Gate is a fine place to satisfy your Indian food cravings, but it's nowhere near my first choice."}

I ordered the malai kofta a vegetarian dish that's made of dough balls and curry, they ask you how spicy you'd like it, I chose regular spicy, and it was spicy enough.

I would just like to say that the people working here are so friendly and helpful which means a lot to me as someone who usually doesn't have Indian food often but wanted to mix it up.

Ended up going with my usual Chicken Tikka Masala which was good I thought but I feel that I should have gotten something new and different here, will have to ask for recommendations next time. However, the garlic naan here is simply unbelievable! It's some of the best garlic naan that I had and would highly recommend anyone coming here to try it as well. They also threw in some rice as well which was nice to see and really complimented the meal.

This was a great experience and next time I'll have to try out their lunch buffet."}

The palak paneer tasted almost exactly like a green enchilada sauce with a distinct flavor of Mexican chilies and corn flour. It's very weird to look at palak, knowing it to be clearly Indian, and then experiencing an entirely different country when you put it in your mouth.

The aloo gobi also lacked depth and tasted very Americanized. The other dishes on the buffet were average. 

The lovely thing about this place is that the staff are incredibly sweet and considerate. I wish them continued success, especially if this is a family owned business. My advice would be to not forget your roots!"}

The hub and I really like Indian food, but often find places disappointing-too rich, lacking complex flavors, or simply not fresh. What a treat to find this place on Yelp - it was as good as one would expect from the reviews (even leftovers heated the next day). The dal is far more flavorful than in many places, using a few different legumes and interesting spices-not full of heavy cream, more a rich gravy consistency. The Bengan Bharta had the wonderful smoky quality of eggplant roasted first in a tandoor, then sautéed with some other tasty veg and spices; yum! The garlic naan was perfectly cooked, as was the less common gobhi (cauliflower) paratha. Vegetable samosas were flaky, with excellent filling and fresh chutneys on the side. Even desserts were delicious and cooked in house. Service by two friendly and welcoming brothers (owners) couldn't be better. The whole experience is like being invited in for a home-cooked meal. We can't wait to return!"}

I've had the Jewish sliders (which are incredible!), the knish, cheese blintz, pastrami sandwich and the chicken matzo ball soup. MUST HAVE THE MATZO BALL SOUP!! I did feel quite full after sharing a large bowl though so prepare for a lot of soup. The knish I had was the potato and onion. I liked it but it was very one note after a while. I had a few bites of my boyfriends mile high pastrami sandwich on challah bread and it was divine!! The challah bread was sweet and amazing and the pastrami was perfect! The blintz is a good sweet dish but also savory. Probably wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.

I really had mixed feelings about going based on some past experiences and all the kitchen drama that you may or may not have heard of. (google it) 

Regardless of that though we had a really good experience this time. 

Our waiter Hoki was wonderful, service was A+. I would advise requesting his section if you ever eat here. 

Their Passion fruit Ice Tea is delicious and our glasses never emptied and were always refreshed with ice on each refill. 

I ordered the Grilled Salmon from the fresh fish selection, it came with Steamed Broccoli and rice. (see pics) It was really good, the Salmon was cooked perfectly. Something I Would definitely order again. 

The Mr. Ordered the Boston House Salad (see pics) I shared a few bites and also enjoyed it. His entree was the Four Cheese Pasta which he really liked too, sorry no pic. 

For dessert we Shared a slice of the Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake (see pics). WOW! That was sinfully good! 


Our service and experience based on today's visit is worthy of 4 stars
( Hoki deserves 5) but an average rating based on all my visits combined I'll go with 3 stars."}

I decided to grab a few quick things from the bakery, wasn't even going to sit to eat. I wasn't even greeted by the 2 people standing at the door. I don't usually care about that but it was just another thing atop everything else. After I get inside, I see multiple people waiting around for someone to come to the bakery to be helped, someone finally does and the employee walks away. Its my turn now and are ready to order. 

I stood around for a good five minutes until I started looking for someone to help. As soon as I found the hostess, she started walking away. Listen, I understand that there are plenty of responsibilites of each employee but I didn't even get a look from her. After walking back towards the register, I see an employee writing something down, I think it may have been the manager or something because they didn't look like a waitress. I kind of look at them and they look right back at me and look back down to continue writing something down. No "can I help you?" or "can I get someone for you?". I eventually just lost all hope at that point and left.

Like I said, I love Chompie's. Their jewish sliders and assorted bakery items are off the charts, but this location just fell flat. Me and my friends won't ever step foot in there again. If you have the choice, go to the one on University. Much better service."}

Yes, yes, that sounds like an awful thing to say! But it really is true, I have had some fabulous seafood dishes in phoenix and some that left a bit to be desired. A group of us came here for the pre-fixe menu. You get an entree and a regular size app for a fixed priced. It's actually a really good deal considering this place is err a little on the pricey side.

We sit down and everyone is super nice! As we wait for our orders, we are brought out some spicy thai like edamame. It was delish!

Before talking about my meal, let's talk about how absolutely knoweldgeable our waitress was. I hate I can't remember her name, but she was SUPERB.. I always say it is nice when you talk with someone who knows the menu down to how the best way to serve it is (i.e. fish should be medium because it loses flavor the longer it's cooked) but offered flexibility when I wanted my potstickers well done (texture always gets me).

My group has the crunch golden pot stickers and calamari - fantastic! They are really setting the tone for me.  For my entree I had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi - this was mahvelous and cooked to absolute perfection. The spicy mustard that accompanied with it took it over the edge! Everything else my group ordered was good as well. People had no complaints which is hard to do in big groups.

Last but not least, dessert. There was some chocolate goodness and something else. I'm not a big fan of desserts, but for those who are.. these were quite tasty!

Would totally go back and Mondays made it way more reasonable."}

When it did my corn beef hash was ice cold with a hot egg on top, that made for a really weird first bite. The food was actually delivered by the General Manager. It was busy and maybe he didn't notice the place was cold. Now I'm not one to send food back so I just ate the bagel. Figured when Alex came back and had seen I only ate the bagel he'd ask. Ha! Nope just said "let me get this out of the way" maybe Alex was having an off day or maybe he was overwhelmed with his section. So I still gave him a good tip. On the way out I see Alex helping a lady pick out cookies in the bakery... good customer service for the lady I guess but what about the 9 tables full of people with no coffee and cold food... oh well, Chompie's is still one of my favorites. Just failed me this morning.

To say it was disappointing is an understatement.  The waiter was non-existent.  After stopping him as he passed by to order an appetizer, we pretty much never saw him again.  While the tables around us were served, we were sitting there for an hour and we were never asked to place an order.  In order to get a glass of wine, we had to flag down another waiter.

I mentioned it to the server, who then replaced it with a crab dish which came burned to a crisp. Charcoal black, you couldn't even taste the crab. Then came dessert. I can't eat bread, so I asked the server to recommend a cheesecake which might have a little less of it. He brought a lemon raspberry cheesecake, which looked delicious, but had bread underneath the cheesecake, which again, I cannot digest. There was so little raspberry sauce, they should have just called it lemon cheesecake. I mentioned it to the server, who agreed with me, stating that wasn't the portion it should come with. I asked for more of the sauce, he disappeared, then came back and told me I'd be charged extra for it. I complained to the manager, who then told me I'd get a gift certificate for the amount of the check. Over a month has passed, and guess what, no gift certificate!

The food here just isn't as good as it is in the Roy's locations in Hawaii. I thought I might have been too picky the first time we visited this location a few months ago, or perhaps the kitchen was having an off-night, but our food this time around was even worse: 

Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs: should have been savory and melt in your mouth. It was just ok. It was much better prepared on our last visit.

Side dish of Szechuan string beans: I  was appalled. It was a pile of steamed green beans -- that's it. When I asked the server, he checked with the kitchen and said they had sauteed the green beans in the Szechuan sauce. It clearly wasn't, but I asked if I could have some of the sauce on the side, so he brought some. The sauce was ok, but not really Szechuan. From what I could see it was just shoyu and chilipaste. Was pretty miffed I had to even pay for this.

Alaea Salt Crusted Bone in Ribeye - My husband ordered this. It was fine for a steak, but nothing great. The biggest disappointment was the Truffled bacon mac n cheese! It had zilch seasoning, had very little cheese sauce, and there was hardly any bacon. I'm someone who can get by without much seasoning, unlike Ryan who wants 10lbs of salt on everything, but even I thought it was waaaaay underseasoned. 

Raspberry Chocolate Lava Cake (forget the actual name on menu): The last time I was here, I commented that it was a bit chewy. I was hoping for a better one this time, but it was even worse. There was not much oozing of chocolate goodness unfortunately, and the cake was even harder/chewier than last time.

I think if you've never been to Roy's in Hawaii, the food is fine and you'll enjoy your meal here. But if you have been to Roy's in Hawaii, it will be a letdown. There is just no comparison!"}

What I wasn't impressed with was their herb-crusted salmon salad.  Maybe it was the word 'crusted' that got me, but I was assuming the fish was going to be served warm.  Surprise!  It was cold.  I choked down as much as I could, but will be going to Pita Jungle and Keegan's for my salmon salads from now on.

And I cant say enough about their pina colada cake cheesecake.  A true taste of the islands, part cake, part cheesecake, all yummy.  The only things missing were the fire dancers and hula girls.

They do take reservations... for parties of 20 or more."}

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

Absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!"}

Last year I was in Honolulu for my birthday and my wife and I had an amazing dinner at Roy's. When my wife found a Roy's here in Arizona, she thought that it would be a nice surprise for my birthday this year.
We were greeted and promptly sat at a table that had a place card wishing me a happy birthday (very nice touch.) We ordered drinks and ordered. I had tuna poke and my wife had lobster dumplings. Both were fantastic and got my hopes up for the entree. My wife had a filet and I ordered the macadamia nut mahi mahi. My wife's filet was spot on although the whipped potatoes and veg were pedestrian. My mahi on the other hand was terrible. I know, I live hundreds of miles from fresh fish but still. The mahi was cooked until every molecule of water was cooked out. Not only did the fish not flake, it turned into dust (that might be a slight exaggeration but still, it was dry as this god forsaken desert that I live in.)
The complimentary birthday dessert was a nice touch and the flourless chocolate cake was great. 
Service was good but I'm not sure that it was $75 per person good (no steak knife until my wife had finished and my wife's dessert was served 15 minutes after mine.)
I would have to say that my night would have been better at the bar just eating appetizers and dessert."}

It was NOT spicy; the chicken was bland (because it was pre-boiled?); the sauce was pure hoisin from a jar. Did the cook put the entire jar of hoisin sauce in this dish, and not other spice? The sauce and the chicken did not go together at all.  My wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap.  It was OK at best. We ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream. It was way too sweet; spoon for spoon, pure sugar would be less sweet. Only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good.

So I only scanned the comments with blinders on and only read the good comments. 
But now that were home and I re-read them I realize that almost everyone liked a few things and several things they didn't.  And for the prices they charged I would think everything should have been fantastic.
Well the $100 it cost to eat there for just two entrees, one salad and one Arnold Palmer was an extreme bummer.  It truly was a waste of our hard earned money.  Since they don't post their prices on their website we thought we would give it a try just from the reviews.  Wrong! 
If I knew we were going to spend that much money we could have gone to the Keg which was soooo much better than Roy's by far. 
The short ribs or should I say two little ones had a burnt layer on top that, after chewing forever I still had to discretely put it in my napkin.  You would have thought for $30 dollars they could have given you more than 1/2 cup of running potatoes and few sprigs of asparagus and broccoli.  If the taste was as exquisite as the cost... maaaybe, but NO, total disappointment! 
The medium rare prime rib was at best medium to well done and covered in a thicker like gravy juice, served with a tiny bowl of Mac N Cheese? Even the ranch dressing had no flavor compared to even Denny''s ... another disappointment. You might let it go by if you were at Steer and Stein.  But when you are going out for your anniversary and a very special time together and figure it's worth the splurge you can't help feel completely disappointed.  I so wish we could have gone somewhere else more worth it."}

Now, it is the first time I have even gone to chompies and the menu was very lengthy. Not something that I mind but every sandwich seemed to have coleslaw on it. I was actually quite surprised about the entire homey atmosphere here as I always envisioned chompies to be like einsteins. 

Once the food came out I discovered that when the menu said horseradish they meant the sauce kind. There seemed to be a long wait for our food and it was cold when it was served. They also gave fruit instead of the requested Coleslaw with my boyfriends sandwich.

I visit this restaurant about 4 times a year. This past visit was probably one of the worst. Ok, maybe it was the worst.
I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. $16.95. This is one of my favs but this time the chicken was a bit over cooked. I'm not a fan of dry chicken. The rest of the dish was ok.
K ordered the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. $17.95. She had to ask for additional sauce because it came out with very little sauce. At least they didn't charge us for it. The sauce was good. The rice was a bit on the undercooked side. The chicken was fine.
C ordered the Buffalo Strips $9.99. $10.99 with fries. This is a great deal. 8 large breaded chicken tenders for $9.99. An extra buck for fries. Heck of a deal.
Grandma C ordered the Carolina BBQ sandwich. $12.95. She didn't eat it because it was chunked pork, not pulled.
Now the bad stuff;
First off, charging $4.50 for a Strawberry lemonade for my son is RIDICULOUS. Second, I think $7.50, $7.95 for a slice of cheesecake is too much. Especially when the whole cheesecake is around $50. And lastly, the Carolina BBQ sandwich is described as being made with pulled pork. It is not. It is made with pork chunks. Not very good for a sandwich. We told the manager we were not pleased with the sandwich but in the middle of our debate on the merits of pulled pork vs pork chunks the fire alarm went off. FOR 10+ MINUTES. (We learned from a server that the key needed to turn off the alarm was taken home by one of the new managers. So the fire dept was on it's way to turn off the alarm) I think a good portion of the guests left after a few minutes because the ear piercing blaring noise of the fire alarm was a bit much to take. We stayed. I was hoping to finish our conversation with the manager but he never returned. We also had hoped that the pork sandwich would be taken off the bill. It wasn't. And we hoped that the Mgr would buy a slice of cheesecake to make up for the sandwich. He didn't. We sat through that blaring alarm for nothing except for an "I can't believe you stayed" from our server. You know what? I can't believe we stayed either.
I did find it interesting when the server mentioned about the Mgr taking the key home she told us they had 4 new managers. Hmmm. Wonder Y.
Management & food; 2 stars."}

We rolled in a little after 9ish, and business was quite slow at this time ... I believe there might have been a few people in the bar area and only another two top in the dining room area.  Needless to say we were seated fairly promptly and the hostess seemed pleasant.

A server greeted us promptly, and since neither of us had been here before and there was a rather extensive menu it took us a few minutes to ask the waiter questions and review our possible menu choices.  I opted to try a Hawaiin (pineapple) Martini, and my friend had a glass of wine.  I must admit the pineapple Martini was delicious and a very well balanced cocktail. 

The server asked us if we would like some complimentary edamame, and I must say I believe they flavored the edamame with some sort of hawaiin spice/flavoring because they tasted quite delicious and different from the typical bland heavily salted edamame.... it was nice.

I decided to try the surf and turf option - filet mignon and lobster tail.  It was very reasonably priced at under $60, and it was very good.  I was actually impressed the lobster was soooo yummy.  My medium filet was nicely flavored hawaiin style and it was accompanied with bearnaise sauce, which is one of my favorite dipping sauces for filet, so I was quite pleased.  I will admit it's not the best lobster tail or piece of filet that I have ever had, so it was not absolutely exceptional, but it was great tasting based on the price and portion size - it hit the spot and the plate presentation was very nice too!! The broccolini was a nice light side.  

My friend tried the half chicken dinner and seemed to like it ... However, I did not try it, so I really can't give any sort of extensive review about it.

Overall, I would probably rate Roy's a solid 4.5 star review if that was possible.  We really enjoyed our dinners/adult beverages, the service was very good, the overall ambiance and look of the restaurant was was appealing, and the reasonable price point/portions were spot on!  I would absolutely recommend Roy's to others, and I am sure I'll be back to have another filet/lobster tail dinner with a Hawaiin twist at some point in the future!"}

I'll definitely be back for lunch again here soon. The portions are gigantic and enabled me to have enough leftovers for a second meal. They also have a skinny cocktail list that is a nice touch.

Also... they serve both kosher and half-sour pickles.  I am not a pickle fan, but their half-sours are ADDICTIVE.  I could make a whole meal out of them if my blood pressure would forgive me.  Salty goodness - yum!

They also have daily specials like Fish Fry Fridays (I believe it is after 4).  Check their website for details.

SERVICE: David is THE BEST server at Chompie's.  He remembers me and DD every time we stop in.  Even if we are not seated in his section, he stops by to say hello.  This kind of service is what brings us back to Chompie's again and again.  He also gives DD the best cookies with her meal.

VALUE: It's excellent.  Kids eat free (1 per adult entree purchased) on Mondays and Tuesdays.  They get a generous sized meal and can choose from about 15 or so meals.  You do have to pay for a drink, but it is well-worth it.

I was doing a sales type dinner, so I looked on Yelp for a good restaurant - Roy's popped up - just around the corner from the office and rated highly.  Without knowing anything, the plan was laid.

The dinner started with edemame - nicely steamed (but a little over-cooked in my opinion - still very good), covered in a mix of salt and sweet - brown sugar, perhaps?  Definitely delicious.  Then we ordered the Roys Canoe Appetizer and a Lobster California Roll.  I highly recommend the Szechuan Pork Ribs off the Canoe, but everything was excellent.  The ribs got more than one complement.

Our main courses were mostly from the sea.  I had the chicken breast of the night which came with bacon gravy and sweet potato puree.  The sweet potato puree was sweet, but the bacon gravy more than made up for it.  I mean, honestly, how can you go wrong with bacon gravy?  The other main courses all got good reviews.

On to dessert and coffee.  One of my dining companions opted for the pineapple upside down cake, and the other for pumpkin cheesecake.  When they came out, they were works of art - comments like "it's a shame to eat it", but they managed it anyway, and commented on how delicious they were.  The cappuchinos around the table were also savored.

Through it all, we had some of the best service I have encountered.  It wasn't obtrusive, but there was always someone close by to assist.

My only complaint (and its common among a lot of restaurants) is that when asked for a recommendation, waitstaff always point to the most expensive thing on the menu.  Either that or they go the marginally less informative route of saying 'well, everything is good'.  Seriously guys - you need to step up and say what YOU like."}

My husband is not a fish person but when we went to Hawaii he loved the fish there. When we went to Roy's my husband fell in love with the fish there. It reminds us both of being back in Hawaii. The fish is melt in your mouth delicious. You will leave satisfied and smiling after dining at Roy's!"}

I have been to Roy's at many locations and especially enjoyed the Roy's on Maui, but this is one of my favorites.  This place is amazing with a reoccurring Hawaiian theme, whats not to love!  It is a mix of European techniques and Asian cuisine while meeting Hawaiian hospitality.

Honestly, I love the Seared Ahi Tuna and get this dish most of the times come. But when I decide to change it up, I am never disappointed.  For the appetizers we loved the crunchy golden lobster pot-stickers, for the salads we loved the roasted beet salad and grilled pear salad and for the entrees (besides the Ahi Tuna) the crab dynamite baked barramundi is delicious(a little rich so be prepared),  the mahi mahi and Hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish is absolutely mouth watering!!! If you are reading this, you must go and try :)  I also heard from one of my friends that the filet mignon is one of the best around.  I have not had the chance yet to give it a whirl. So maybe a surf & turf next? Last but not least is the dessert.  This may be my favorite at any restaurant out there.  Roy's Chocolate Souffle.  A delicious chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a tad of raspberry sauce - it literally melts in your mouth.  This is a MUST, make sure you order it!  Remember, there is always room for dessert!

Monday nights are usually a fix priced 3-course menu, so you should check it out. Great deal if they still offer.

My friend and I have dined here many times and we have had some issues in the past with take-out food, so make sure your order is correct before leaving.

ALOHA!"}

First time here, came with my friend for restaurant week in September.
We came on a Thursday night around 7:30 - mostly empty restaurant. The hostess was really sweet. The place itself is clean, and the decor is nice.

We were especially disappointed in the server. He seemed overwhelmed, even though there were plenty of other servers there; he was overall inattentive. This seemed especially prominent once he realized we were doing restaurant week - maybe he didn't think he would get the same kind of tip as a table ordering off the regular menu? Not sure. At one point, a second server even came over to "help out", but was equally rushed and didn't really seem to help much. Our server also disappeared for long stretches, especially when we were ready for the check, and came back smelling like smoke. It would have been okay if we could have flagged someone else down - there were plenty of servers standing around - but we weren't able to and had to wait 15-20 minutes just for the check!

I really could have forgiven the poor service if the food had been good, but it was just average.
Best things we had:
- Lobster potstickers - amazing, very good!
- Grilled salmon - pretty good, nothing outstanding but a solid dish

Everything else was just "meh", including:
- Teppanyaki Shrimp ... not good, bland, mushy fried rice
- Grilled ceasar salad
- Desserts - the choclate dessert and the raspberry cheesecake, both just fine, nothing special.

Overall, for a $100 meal, I would have expected much better - at least on either the service end or the food end. Both could use some improvement.
No wonder the place wasn't busy."}

We must have had an off night or bad waiter last time. We decided to celebrate our anniversary one more time here, and we're glad. The food was amazing, and service was much more the norm. 

We came to the special Roy Yamaguchi dinner and wine pairing. It was fabulous. Roy made an appearance and was so nice. He took pics with those of us taking part in the special dinner pairing, as well as the regular dining crowd. That was a great treat. Best of all, we had the special happy anniversary dessert. Loved it! Thanks. 

Old: 
So, I still enjoy coming here - mostly. And I wish I could do 31/2 stars. But I've not been as happy with the service. It was our 21st anniversary at our most recent visit...and no flowers on table (at first), no card, no special treat - we used to get a mini dessert with happy anniversary on the plate. Even the upside down pineapple cake didn't have happy anniversary on the plate. Super disappointing. Good food and cocktails overall, though. But my rare filet was more medium rare. Our waiter didn't check back to make sure all was good before we were mostly finished. And we got a frown when we tried to use a $20 off coupon. Hopefully next time will be better for the amount paid."}

However, the last few times we've been there, the quality of the food has declined and the service is really bad. It seems as if the whole staff has completely turned over and I feel that's why the service has declined so significantly. For example, this morning, my husband and I went around 9:30. We checked in with the hostess and sat at the bar so we could watch the World Cup match. We sat for 10 minutes and nobody came to see if we needed water or if we were ready to order. There was a gentleman sitting a couple of chairs over, at the bar area, and he had food and the manager came to check on him. After 10 minutes, we left. As we were walking out, the hostess and 2 servers were standing by the hostess station talking and just watched us walk out. I won't be back. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because their bagels and breads are good. It is also one of the few places I can get my poppy seed bagel. I guess I will have to get it to go if I want one."}

I got the fish tacos which were ehh, if you've had them in SoCal none can compare.  We also got the blueberry cheese cake to go and that was pretty good also. 

Why 3 stars?   Nothing wrong with our experience but nothing great.  If you've been to one and want to go back it's a sure bet, it's a chain restaurant with no true authenticity, but a menu the same length of a Harry Potter novel so everyone can be pleased for their meal."}

The dessert was a little too much for me in terms of quantity.  It's a lot for a single serving and probably could've been like 2 servings instead.

The restaurant wasn't too noisy but we were seated in a secluded area, so that's why it was probably quieter.  Nice ambiance.  Will be back."}

We received an email invitation from Roy's that Caymus Winery was hosting a Wine Dinner with limited seating. The menu preview sounded fantastic, so we jumped on it.

Apparently Caymus Wineries hosts this Wine Dinner every year. It started off with a Mix & Mingle introducing their Champagne and an introduction to their wines and a short video of the history of the winery. Then followed the 5 course dinner paired each with a different wines. We started with the Dungeness Crab then the Sea Scallop & Foie Gras, followed by an Alaskan Black Cod and a Wagyu Beef Short Rib, finally to end with a Baked Alaska. All the while sipping on their selections of Caymus Blended White, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. All the dishes and wine pairings were absolutely spectacular!

Again keep in mind this was a Roy's hosted event with Caymus Wines and a representative along with Roys serving staff and chef to make these special dishes for this occasion. 

Private room, service and food 5 STAR! I would recommend this to anyone next year when Caymus Wineries comes back."}

I should mention we only do To Go orders. As we work full time and have 4 children, no time for anything else. 

Tonight, I started calling them to place a order about 25 minutes before arriving there. I was on hold the entire time. When I get there I see my call on hold while the place is actually empty. The place was empty, almost no clients but servers chatting around. 

I ordered a Cesar salad and paid $15 for it. I drove another 25 min home and when I sit down to eat (see picture) they ONLY had plain lettuce on my salad. Who in this world would pay $15 for a pot of lettuce. 

Yesterday, I ordered chicken wings and they were literally burned.

The star of the meal for me was the szechuan green beans. They were flavored with what looked like small slices of Andouille sausage.  Crispy tender and perfectly spiced.

Wait! Not an impression. It's the real, cop-a-feel deal Holyfield.

There's a meat market near the entrance, with acres of sausage (heyooo!) and a bakery for takeout, with all the usual delicatessen suspects.

- fantastic soups of the day
-  salad, done right (as in, mostly dressing, cheese and [chosen meat], with a token 
   offering of lettuce
- sandwiches that consist of a huge platter of meat with a couple of triangles of toast 
   hidden somewhere beneath
- gravy, Gravy, GRAVY
- pickles. On EVERYTHING.
- French fries that are served in portions large enough to share with everyone at your 
   table, or at least one very fat man.
- attentive servers that aren't snooty or b*tchy or ignorey (not a word, but whatever)

The only possible drawback is the slightly Disneylandish pricing of the food, but meh, it's not really Futureland-bad. 

And anyway, would you rather have a $15 Mickey Mouse pencil topper that you'll end up losing in your P.E. locker under a bunch of socks, or a $15 Reuben sandwich that can feed an African nation for the foreseeable future?

My top picks:

Thai chicken lettuce wraps (this makes it in my top 5 favorites). I love how fresh everything is.  The satay chicken is perfection.  The sauces are incredible.  I could lick the tamarind cashew, wait I DO lick it...

The fried zucchini and garlic ranch is delicious.

The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is so creamy and yummy."}

We had been there for dinner before but it was a nice change :)

 First off the bartender, Matt, was super personable and greeted us right away.

My husband and I don't eat meat, but we LOVE fish - so we ordered 1 of each of the fish appetizers served during Aloha hour...

1) Mahi Fish Taco - Super fresh and a nice crunch...oh and the jalapeno sauce -YUM!
2) Lobster Potstickers - also very nice...wish there were more than 3 per portion
3) Ahi tuna roll - Definitely our favorite of the four! One of the best sushi rolls i've ever had
4) Ebi Roll - close second to the ahi roll...the addition of mango  really elevated this "shrimp tempora" roll to a new level

We finished it off with the lemon cheesecake - so refreshing!

We definitely recommend Roy's for dinner or Aloha hour!"}

It would also be a nice place to take your international friends from China or Mexico. That's because the atmosphere and interior is well designed. When I took my mom here yesterday, she was in awe. "Wow, this place looks great!"

That's all that the Cheesecake Factory offers.

The waiter brought us two empty plates. The dishwasher didn't clean it correctly, so he exchanged it for new ones right away.

The food is not great. That's why you shouldn't bring your spouse here for an anniversary or have a first date here. My mom ordered a pasta and we both agreed that it tasted bland. 

Finally, we shared a slice of cheesecake and my mom ordered a coffee. The slice of cheesecake was good, but it's not worth the money.

The lunch+dessert+coffee+tip was around $34 that day. The place has a great atmosphere, but the food isn't worth anywhere near $34."}

I love Cheesecake Factory and all I needed (wanted) in my life was a slice of their cheesecake. Long story short, I didn't get it. Sad day. 

The wait was practically nonexistent, though I did have to wait for just a few minutes for the hostess to return, since there was seemingly only one on duty for the beginning of dinner. Not terrible. We sat down and this is where the waiting really happened. It took a little while to get waters, then to get our drinks ordered, and then to order. A lot of time was spent waiting for the waiter to come back and check up on us and to get our bill. I needed to get going for a movie, and I knew that if I had ordered that darn cheesecake, we would have been sitting around even longer. I'll come back here for sure, but I was just less than impressed with my experience this time around."}

It has a great counter where you can look at all of their meats and desserts.

When I stopped there last, I got a little more than I bargained for. I stopped in to get a take-away bagel and the customer in front of me was being very difficult. They did not want to pay for their cream cheese, okay I get it there are difficult people. When this difficult lady left, I just wanted to move on and not dwell upon it. Then the cashier continues to complain to me as I was placing my order. It felt very awkward to be complain to and I tried my best to change the topic but it just kept coming up.

Furthermore, I got a earful when the cashier started yelling at one of the servers right in front of my very eyes. Then the server went into the kitchen and started yelling at someone else.

This is a great place and I have been coming here for years, but I think I will reconsider knowing how much drama there is here. I hope they can improve how they behave in front of their customers."}

My mom also got a salad, BBQ chopped chicken salad. The ranch that comes with the salad is not good. I love ranch but this ranch is not good at all! My moms plate for her salad was dirty and crusty on the outside of the plate which was pretty gross.

Why? Well, first of all because our table was really wobbly and would move whenever we'd lift up our drinks to take a sip, or move ANYTHING on the table. Second, because it was so freaking COLD in there, due to the ceiling fan above us on full speed and the A/C blowing down. I shivered the entire duration of the meal. 

Our friend had to keep reminding the waitress, and the helper who helped serve our food, that he ordered cocktail sauce for his All You Can Eat Fish & Chips. It took FOREVER to get that to him! We all got the Fish & Chips Friday Special...while it was pretty good, my fries were too done for me to the point I could only finish about half of them...and just having recent oral surgery, I couldn't eat anything super hard or crunchy due to sensitivity and the surgery areas in the process of healing. My fish, however, was just right and I could eat it without fail. 

Took home a piece of Red Velvet Cake for dessert. The cake itself was dry and the frosting was perfect. I was rather disappointed. Also, the floor inside the restaurant was slick and felt greasy. That itself is a safety hazzard."}

I have an unhealthy obsession with the Cheesecake Factory. Yes yes, this is a chain, I know. But honestly, I don't give a flying f*** if its a chain or an independent restaurant owned by some cute little family down the road. As long as the food is delicious and plentiful, the service fast and friendly, the cost is palatable,  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant, I will be a fan of any place. After all, isn't that what writing reviews and being a foodie is about?
I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I can't think of a time when I had a non pleasant experience. Yes, there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others, but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service. 
If you have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know about their menu. It is literally a book! They pride themselves in having something for everyone so there are tons of items to choose from. Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong: 

Appetizers:
- Sweet corn tamale cakes
- Fried chicken sliders
- Avocado Eggrolls
- Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot. They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids
- Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not, their clam chowder is the best I have ever had

Entrees:
- Chicken Costelleta
- Chicken Chipotle Pasta
- BBQ Ranch chicken salad
- Salisbury chopped steak
- Crispy spicy beef
- Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavors

Keep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. You could share one entree with another person and get an appetizer and be stuffed yet not spend alot. Now I will admit that there were some things I had at the CC Factory that were not that great. The crabcake burger is too greasy and overpowering, and their mac and cheese balls are nothing impressive. But the good far outweigh the bad and there definitely is something for everyone. Heck, if anything, there is always the cheesecake which they have in every flavor imaginable. Try the dutch apple or carrot, these are my favorites!"}

Once seated the service was outstanding, it was a crazy busy night and the staff all worked very well together.  The food was very good, although the ceviche appy was very small and in my opinion not worth getting, the others dining with me had the soft shell crab and they were delicious.  The Hot and Sour soup was a bit spicy but so tasty.  The entrees all great as well.  We were all given $20 to return in the next few weeks, we will go back for sure to take advantage of that."}

We arrived and it must have just been before the dinner rush. We got seated right away. Soon after we saw lots of people coming in. The place was getting full . Mom didn't want a lot. She was saving herself for some pie. she ordered the nachos app. and a salad. the side salad was great but the nachos were over whelming for her. Her eye got really big. she knew she couldn't finish them. As a good son I helped put a nice dent to it. I gat the spicy chicken pasta with asparagus. It was great. I almost didn't want to get a piece of pie. But we were here. And we were an hour away form home. Not chance on taking that home. So we got a piece. Each. Yup she went with the favorite. Fresh strawberries on top of her pie. I went with the Apple strudel. It was amazing like always. Are plates were great proportion. The pie was also great. Our waiter gave us great service.

The portion sizes are also ridiculously large and food too unhealthy. I avoided this place for years until the last year when someone really wanted to go here, and I forced myself to go. When I showed up, I was pleasantly surprised by their Skinnylicious menu which has options 590 calories or less. It's a sizable and diverse menu. That immediately won me over. Of course the other large portions/unhealthy options are still there, but I can appreciate the increased sensitivity to a nutrition-conscious customer. Flash forward another few months, Cheesecake Factory started including calorie information on their menu. Another added bonus. I know nutrition in America is heading in this direction but nevertheless, I am still impressed.

They offer bread as an appetizer that always arrives at the table warm! Menu options are bountiful and food types vary greatly. Everything usually tastes good. Their cheesecake is AMAZING! But, it's extremely sugary and fatty so beware.

Specifically for this location, they always seem to have good customer service, one of their redeeming factors. Their wait staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and professional. They're always quick no matter how busy they are. The hostesses are always nice, despite the chaos of large crowds. There is usually a wait varying from 5-90 minutes during busy hours. I went there today and the wait was maybe 5 minutes. When my name was called, I started walking up but saw someone else walk up to the hostess desk and claim herself as Sylvia. This other person may have heard wrong and something completely innocent happened, but when I finally made my way there and told them I was Sylvia, they apologized profusely for what had happened and seated me immediately. It wasn't their fault this happened, but I still appreciated the way the handled it."}

The French country salad tasted excellent as usual. However, it was supposed to contain grilled asparagus, which was missing.

I grew up in Philly and also lived in New Jersey for many years before moving here, and Chompie's food makes me feel like I'm back on the east coast where there were many, many places like Chompie's.  The menu selections are fantastic and the food is also fantastic.  There are many items on the menu that you can't get anywhere else in the Phoenix & surrounding areas besides the other Chompie's locations, as far as I know.

So when I asked her where she wanted to go for her Birthday , this is where she choose. Now we had not been to this location ever. 
Just some of the others around the Country and Hawaii.
Plus it had been well over a year since we had even visited Roy's, but they were the shiny star of my memories. Every thing you could ever want in a Seafood Restaurant.

When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, I told them it was Rachel's B day. When we arrived they told her Happy Birthday and gave us special menus on the inside it said Happy Birthday Rachel and the date. Wow, I thought that was pretty amazing.

Our server was an amazing girl that thought of every thing. The manager even came over to wish my daughter a Happy Birthday.
All the drinks were usurper! The food was truly amazing!! We had the Canoe for two for starters, even though there were 3 of us, there was more than enough. Plus, Mario got a salad which he said was delish!

We had the Butterfish , the Mahi Mahi , and the Old School combo,which was 4 fish dishes on one large dish.Mario had that one. Every thing was perfect, I mean everything. 
For dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle and they even treated the Birthday girl to a wonderful Creme Burle, with fresh fruit and chocolate cake. They even put Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce on her dessert plate.
Yes it is expensive but, at least you are getting what you pay for . 
Great service and Great food."}

This place is absolutely WONDERFUL! In celebration of my birthday a group of friends and I went to Roy's. A friend made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we were immediately seated. I opened my menu and to my surprise inside the menu was a flyer that was personalized for all the guest in my party wishing me, yours truly, a happy birthday. It was a nice keepsake. At the end of our meal we were also photographed and given the picture in a nice frame to forever capture the event....Anywho...on to the food.

For an appetizer I enjoyed the lobster roll. It was good. The seafood fresh and the presentation awesome.  My girlfriends had salt and pepper calamari and the other had szechuan baby back ribs (these were heavenly).

Main entrees we enjoyed the misoyaki butterfish and it was succulent, moist and melt in your mouth fabulous. My other friend enjoyed the rack of lamb and judging by the bones left on her plate they must have been pretty darn good as well. 

Dessert. I had the pineapple upside down cake and my friends had the apple crisp tart and the molten hot chocolate cake...orgasmic...lol

Oh, I forgot the sangria it was Wonderful as well...

This place is awesome. However, if you are looking for a $20 meal this is not your place. Be prepared to spend a little more than average here. It is worth every penny. Appetizers are roughly between $10 -$20. My dinner entree alone was $28.95 and desserts average what appetizers cost. Bring your credit card...lol 

I hear happy hour is wonderful with wonderful prices. I will be returning very, very soon."}

Every meal has been really, really, really good...I dream of them...lol

So this review is almost a review in comparison with other Roy's, rather than a review on the restaurant itself. The food was great compared to other restaurants, but not as good as the food at Roy's in the two locations in Hawaii (and we ordered the same dishes as I've had in Hawaii). Also, I saw later that the amount with tip charged on my credit card was $2 more than what we had actually signed for....so that was not cool :( Definitely one star deducted for that.

Entrees: 

Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi - Well prepared, but seemed under-seasoned than other Roy's preparation

Braised Short Ribs of Beef - This was on-par with Hawaii Roy's location preparation. My husband ordered this and I was trying to swipe as many bites as I could lol I was enjoying it more than my mahi mahi.

Dessert:

My husband ordered the cheesecake, which I actually hadn't had in Hawaii -- it was SO good! It was very rich, creamy and the crust was perfect. I ordered my absolute favorite -- the chocolate molten cake with the raspberry drizzle...YUM! And it was delicious as always, but they were skimpy with the raspberry drizzle here and the cake was a bit chewier than Hawaii's preparation. 

All in all, it was a great meal compared to other restaurants in general. But compared to other Roy's locations, the food was just okay (plus not cool for the tipping 'mistake')."}

The service was spot on. All the Wagner wine was amazing. Wagner had both red and white wines. I would buy this wine at Roy's or Total Wines. The food was perfectly paired with the wine. Roy's even substituted out one item due to a food allergy for me. This event has renewed my faith in Roy's! I would recommended attending any wine event or having a wonderful evening out at Roy's!"}

We discovered there was one in Chandler and it just happened to be extremely close to our hotel.  We went for Happy Hour and had some drinks and appetizers.  My wife loves the pineapple martini, and I had the Kona longboard, which is what I had at the Roy's in Hawaii.  An authentic Hawaiian beer!  The spiced pork ribs are awesome and tastes great!  The spring rolls were good too, but not as good as the ribs.  I ordered the butterfish, which is a great, tender, mild fish.  My wife had the ahi tuna entree.  Both were delicious, properly cooked and tasted fresh (although I don't know if it was).  The sauce on the butterfish was great, although there was a hint of wasabi, which I didn't really like.  It also came with black rice, which tastes almost like risotto with a sweetness.  I didn't care for he rice too much, but my wife liked it.  And, of course, we got dessert.  Chocolate soufflé for me, and the pineapple upside down cake for the wife.  Both were delicious, but you need to order it early because it takes 20 minutes to make.

We need to give kudos to our bartenders, Justin and Samantha.  We sat at the bar and they served us dinner and drinks all night.  They were very attentive to our needs and chatted us up a bit when things were slow.  Truly professional, friendly, and both made great pineapple martinis.

First off the atmosphere in here is nice but very dim and hard on the eyes. 
Ok now the food. I had the Crispy Cuban Egg Rolls. They were delicious, at the Scottsdale chain(previously went and had the sampler). 
The ham and Swiss is perfectly melted onto the wrap to make it melt in your mouth. The mustard sauce is the proverbial cherry on top. 4.5 stars. 

For dessert I got the chocolate mousse cheesecake. One word, delicious. It is one of the best cakes I've had here. The presentation of it makes it look like a 5 star restaurant, taste included. Biting in, the vanilla mascarpone is the first thing that hits the taste buds. It is creamy and rich yet not overwhelming. Next, getting into the chocolate. The mousse was delicious and not too overwhelming. Overall the flavors blend together to create a perfect dessert. 5 stars. 

My only trouble here was the service. If I didn't say when, then why did you stop with the mozzarella? 

Overall 3/5."}

So...the boyfriend and I headed out to this very posh place. The waiters were very attentive...like putting a napkin on my lap, refreshing water practically after each sip, walking me to the restroom, clearing plates as soon as we were done...like that. So we had lobster pot-stickers to start out with. It had a butter demi-glaze sauce (I believe) that had a spice to it and i don't think I can have any pot-sticker ever again that will be as good as this. These were so good! Second course I got filet mignon and the boyfriend had short ribs. Both excellent, cooked to perfection and came with buttery mashed potatoes, brocolini and small carrots. Seriously...the potatoes were amazing. I kept dipping the veggies in it to enhance their flavor. 
Dessert choice was a chocolate souffle for me and a cheesecake with blueberry sauce for the boyfriend. All in all, best service, best food and wonderful experience that I've ever had.
Need to try this place again....the pot-stickers alone make it worth while."}

The Corned Beef, it's lean, well prepared, piled high...
On the marble rye with Muenster cheese and mustard 
-for me, it's a dream date.
And before I forget, a half sandwich is more than enough.  The server told me it's like six ounces of meat on the half sandwich.
Come on, meat, bread, an accompaniment (coleslaw, potato salad, French fries, other).  How much more so ya need?!
The whole sandwich is eight ounces piled high on your choice of bread or roll.  Oh, and before I forget, they have a few gluten free options too.
Something to consider if you're in the GF train like so many are and more of us are learning we probably should be too.
But anyway, their deli sandwiches are probably the BEST in the Valley.  Heck, maybe even the entire state of Arizona ftm."}

It was mine and my wife's 4 year anniversary and so I made reservations here for 7pm on Friday. When we arrived, we were greeted by multiple friendly employees and I believe even the manager, who was walking around to make sure things were running smoothly, it seemed! We got walked to our table and were soon greeted by our server Eric. He was so kind, and so friendly. He made sure we were taken care of!

We started off with the Sunshine sushi and omg! Tempora, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, rice cooked to perfection, YUM! It was the best sushi roll I've ever had in Arizona! My entree was the shrimp and fried rice and my wife got the braised beef. Each dish was incredibly delicious. The shrimp was fresh, juicy, and plump. The beef melted in your mouth! The entrees did not disappoint! Last, the dessert was pineapple upside down cake and oh my... Let's just say that was gone QUICK!  

Overall, if you have a nice occasion and want to eat well, choose Roy's. It was one of the most pleasant experiences we've had and we can confidently say we'll be back! 

A side note though, it is more on the fancy side so I was surprised to see people in T-shirts and flip flops.... Cmon people! It's fun to get dressed up every once in a while. Let's keep it classy!"}

If I'm craving something sweet, I get the stuffed French Toast which is stuffed with whipped cream cheese and strawberry jam then deep fried. Unmatched!

For lunch/dinner I can go for the Borenstein burger with bacon and sweet potato fries or the traditional Jewish sliders. Matzo ball soup is great, too. For dessert, I'll go for their 7 layer cake, brownie, or black and white cookie. Nom nom nom."}

I was a little shocked at our treatment. The waiter walked up just a minute behind her and was just as good as ever.

The portions are huge, and the service is *usually* decent.

We went last night (Tuesday) after a rough day, neither my husband or I felt like cooking. Figuring this was our best option since it would have something for everyone, we went late hoping we'd miss any crowds. But its a Tuesday night in late May, why on earth where there be a wait?

Sure enough, we got there and it was a 5 minute wait. No big deal, even though we waited more like 10-15 minutes...and that is no fun with a hungry 4 year old, when its after 8pm. Probably our mistake as parents thinking we would get a quick meal, and be in and out. 

We were seated and it took another 10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. Our waiter did apologize for the wait but it was a very half-assed apology. Either be sincere or don't bother mentioning it. We also ordered our food since we had time to look over the menu. Drinks were slow getting out, another 10 minutes. Food was also slow getting out. We were probably here 40 minutes before we got our food. It was busy, but not that busy. 

Our waiter was nice but did not ask me once if I needed a refill on my drink, my glass was clearly empty. He did offer my husband another beer though and promptly brought that out. 

The service here just sucked, and its gotten worse every time we've come. I know losing us as customers won't make or break you, but we really are done with this location. If you must go to Cheesecake, opt for the Biltmore location!"}

There are a few salad dishes in their small bites or skinny menu that I have been wanting to try, so I ordered the fresh vegetables salad. When I received the order I was disappointed. There were no beets to be found. At first I doubted myself... thinking maybe I ordered something that doesn't have beets. So I didn't tell my server. I should ask a question but I didn't want to be a pain. The salad honestly was very plain. A lot of lettuce that I don't care for... I should have ordered the beets with Arugula. Oh well maybe the skinny menu is to blame. Hubby ordered the blackened shrimp on the other hand it was fantastic dish.

Definitely not inexpensive and quite expensive for us.  We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary here this year.  I made a reservation online, very easy.  Saw their menu online, so I knew our dinner was going to be over $100 for the two of us.

Neither of us drink alcohol, so that greatly tamed our bill.  The ambiance is romantic and tropical, but noisy and fairly dark.  The staff there from the time we entered all treated us like royalty as well as the others.

They had a note for us in our menus helping us celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We really loved the personal touch.  Our water glasses were always refilled.  The food was scrumptious.  

For appetizers, I can't remember the exact names, we had some pork spare ribs (this was a lot and I expected a couple spare ribs but it almost seemed like 1/3 or 1/2 a slab of baby back ribs.  Very tender and cooked perfectly.  My husband LOVES ribs.  I ordered some type of beef spring rolls, but spring rolls for the Asian is not deep fried, rather they use rice paper.  They deep fried these "spring" rolls.  These were delicious, but the most expensive eggrolls I've ever eaten.  Still that's fine.  I think appetizers price can go from $7-$15.

Every plate that came out from the appetizers to the dessert were all beautifully decorated.  Different people other than the main server checked on us.  They made it very special for us.

For dinner, my husband ordered some stuff pork tenderloin stuff with pecans and dates with a bacon risotto.  We've never eaten not fully cooked pork before.  We were uncomfortable with eating medium rare pork and sent that dish back to the kitchen to have it cooked more.  They were fine and didn't treat us as if we were ruining the chef's creation.  My husband liked the pork well done and not pink.  This was probably in the realm of $28-30.

I had some butterfish, which is a black Alaskan cod that just melted in your mouth.  The sauce had a sweet taste to it and it was atop baby bok choy and a black rice.  Very yummy.  I think this was in the realm of $35+.

I didn't expect the portions of food to be so big.  I was thinking the portions would be more along the lines of French food, so by the time dinner was done, we were stuffed and had to take home some food.

This was more than enough food and we didn't have any room for dessert, but they surprised us with this beautiful plate of desserts with "Happy Anniversary" written on it with a trio of desserts on it - creme brulee, some chocolate thing and something else.  All very yummy.  Though we were stuff, we ate this and this really put us over the edge.

We gave a really big tip because they gave us way, way more than we expected with top notch service.  This won't be a restaurant we frequent due to price, but it is definitely worth doing on a special occasion.  

This was a wonderful date.  All the food was yummy.  Excellent service and worth every penny."}

Here is the story of a horrific lunch experience. We decided to eat at Chompie's for a graduation luncheon to celebrate with family and friends... What started out being fine with our drinks served transformed into a nightmare. 

Food was served...by the owner (did not know that at the time) I ordered their signature meal- the jewish sliders, others ordered the coney hotdog, potato pancakes, salmon bagel. Food looked fine but looks can be very deceiving. 

Everyone had at least a bite taken when I looked up and saw the mortified face of the person seated across from me. That look only means one thing...something terrible is wrong and it's on you! I looked down to find the largest cockroach I have ever seen crawling on my left shoulder!  

As a side note, I am not afraid of bugs... However a cockroach is far more then just a simple bug, and the size of this cockroach would give the heebie-jeebies to the toughest men.

Naturally, I swatted at it... Making it land close to the person I was sitting next towe both in reaction jumped out of the booth we were in ... The man that delivered our food just moments ago was there in an instant & to our shock grabbed this beast of a rodent by his bare hands.  My only thought is that the next table he served got a little extra on their plate! 

Not even having one full bite of my lunch the only thing the manager did was say he would take care of the meal... WHAT MEAL? We didn't get to get before our unwanted guest arrived, in my view absolutely nothing was done to rectify this absolutely grotesque situation.

This was no ordinary lunch, this was a lunch to celebrate a great achievement and enjoy each other company.  Now forever will these graduates will remember their graduation lunch with a huge disgusting cockroach oppose a celebration of their success as to what the lunch was intended for. 

Not only did Chompie's completely embarrass me, it also completely mortified me. 

I want you to image a cockroach the size of your thumb crawling on you right after you bight into your food... How would you react and feel?   Then add a special celebration to the situation.  I am completely mortified."}

Well I needed a gluten free place to take my parents, so we went to Arrowhead and everyone was happy with their dishes.  We've been back to Chandler twice since then.  

Be forewarned egg white dishes are made from powder not necessarily gluten free.

The breakfast tacos and skillets are nice for gluten free.  Can't beat their brisket.

They have many flavors of regular bagels and flavors of cream cheese.  My family enjoys the breakfast menu most!  Pancakes are huge servings!

I used to go to the Scottsdale location very few weeks as I had appointments out there.  My eggs were scorched a few times and I despise that, so I no longer go to that location."}

My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband had made the reservation online.  It was great because it asked if we had any allergies, so he could let them know ahead of time that I'm gluten free.  They also asked if we were celebrating anything special, so he let them know if was our anniversary.

As soon as we walked in the door and let them know our names, they immediately wished us a happy anniversary, and grabbed me a gluten free menu.  When we got to the table we found they had created personal menu inserts, congratulating us on our anniversay, brought us a complimentary glass of champagne, and let us know the chef had prepared for us an anniversary tasting menu (gluten free for me) if we wanted to go off the regular menu.  It was truly memorable.

The tasting menu was amazing, simply amazing.  The started with a shrimp & scallop appetizer.  Scallops are one of my favorite things, and this was cooked perfectly.  They brought us a small plate of steamed edemame, and the seasoning was super delicious.  The next course was ahi tuna poke.  It was a little spicy, but the cucumber and avacado they served it with toned it down and made it perfectly balanced.  We were then served butterfish bites.  I have to say, that is one of the best things I've ever eaten, hands down.  It served with a ginger glaze and a little wasabi.  I could have eaten a whole portion of that.  We also had a small salad of arugala, dates, panchetta, and a white balsamic dressing.  It was so light and refreshing.  All the flavors just exploded in your mouth.  The main course consisted of steak and a half lobster.  The lobster was buttery, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The steak was served with a red wine ver blanc.  The official dessert was their chocolate souffle, but as a surprise they served a mini dessert for us with chocolate cake and creme brulee.  They decorated the plate to say Happy Anniversay and took a complimentary picture for us.  Those mini desserts were divine.  Then came the souffle, I'd been eager to try it for about a week.  It did not disappoint.  The chocolate was rich, the inside was gooey chocolate goodness.

Between the experience of all the managers & our server catering to our anniversary and the amazing food, my husband and I are guaranteed to become regulars here."}

If you haven't tried Roy's before I suggest the many sampler plates, you will find a favorite! Mine is the Miso Butterfish, melts like butter in your mouth, with a flavor experience you have never had before! Less fusiony dish-The filet mignon is to die for! Service was sketchy, I had to refill my own sparkling water twice! We waited a long time  without a check in from our waiter in between orders!!! Hence, the 4 stars, not 5!

Even the manager refilled our drinks once.  Everything was served quickly and with a smile.  The food was excellent!  I highly recommend the short ribs. My husband marvels at the creamy texture of the mashed potatoes. The only issue was that we had to wait for our table 15 minutes after our reservation time. A couple arrived after us but were seated before us. Even if their reservation was the same time or before ours, it's my opinion that you should seat waiting/on time people first. We will be back."}

Normally we go to the Scottsdale location which I will say is considerably better than the Chandler location. The Chandler location appears old, dated, dirty and not to mention service slow. It took a bit of time for the server to even come to our table with menus and then take our order. I think we were the forgotten child while waiting and waiting for our food, while it seemed other tables were getting their food before us even after they sat after us.

Missing my craving for Chopped liver, I ordered the appetizer portion that came with Bagel Chips and a slice of Onion. My friend ordered the Pastrami on Rye which was good, though the sandwich size was not piled high like the Scottsdale location serves. My Chopped Liver was a little too sweet for my taste which I never had that in the Scottsdale either.

Chandler location, service slow, kitchen slow, food OK, atmosphere: old, and dirty. Go to the Scottsdale location, I'm a 4 Star fan there!"}

We made reservations in advance and it was nice to be greeted with a "Happy Anniversary," along with a menu message.

Our waitress was very good. She answered our menu questions and obviously knew the menu.  We started with the lobster potstickers (recommend).  I ordered a Hawaiian martini; husband ordered the Maui Mule.  Wished I had ordered the Maui Mule.

Salads were excellent, perfect sizes and tasty.  I ordered the fish trio, which was just the right-sized portions of the butterfish (highly recommend), mahi mahi (tasty) and salmon (so-so).  Husband ordered the swordfish (so-so) and wished he had ordered the butterfish. 

We did order the soufflé; however, if we'd known we'd be getting a complimentary brownie for our anniversary (delish!), we'd probably wouldn't have ordered the soufflé.

All in all, a nice dining experience.  Our feedback:

Music: The music was too loud and not very classy.  Had a Denny's Restaurant feel.  Was expecting a classier décor.

Servers: As soon as we finished a final bite, the servers swooped in and removed our plates, making us feel rushed.  They even swooped away our desert plates and utensils, leaving us to use our fingers for the complimentary brownies. Not cool.

Food and cocktails were tasty. We'd go back."}

We've been here probably 40 times in the past 4 years.  What's up with not giving them some Yelp love?  

I think 37 of those times were for breakfast and we have worked our way through most of the breakfast menu.  Love the huge omelets and fried potatoes that come on the side.  Never had a bad meal here.

Most recently Mr. M and I had had a very long day of work and house hunting and were exhausted.  I suggested Chompie's because I was craving some soup.  I had the matzo ball soup and he had the clam chowder.  Both were delicious and we were passing those bowls back and forth.  I ended up keeping the chowder and taking a large bowl of it home for Saturday.  They only have the chowder on Fridays, but they have 5 or 6 other kinds of soup every day.  

I also had the Jewish sliders and he had a half sandwich with hard salami and Havarti on sourdough.  I can't even type hard salami without getting the giggles, let alone say it.  Their famous sliders were excellent as always and Mr. M's sandwich accompanied the soup perfectly.  

The bakery counter is amazing and full of all kinds of goodies.  I try not to look at it when I'm in there or I will get sucked in.  

Only once out of all the times we've been here have we had bad service and that was an older broad working the bakery counter who was ignoring everyone so she could chat with her friend about how things used to be in New York.  blah blah blah.  She needed a reminder that she was at work, BUT I haven't seen her in a long, long time so maybe she moved back East.  Usually the employees are very friendly and efficient.  I would say Chompie's is my #1 breakfast choice and then the Biscuits on Dobson.  Excellent food every time!"}

Not knowing how they serve it, we just ate it anyway. Also to add the Jewish rye for the hot (so called) hot pastrami was falling apart. Not more than 15 minutes of leaving the place my stomach started to hurt and I had to use the restroom. Safe to say we will not be dining here or other locations anymore. It's weird how one location can ruin it for all the other locations."}

I would definitely not return to this restaurant; although based on other reviews I might try one in a different city.  The service was not good.  We were seated by a very inexperienced host and our main waitress seemed to be very new and moved from "stalking us" to ignoring us for long periods of time.  In addition, the food was good but not up to par with the prices.  I had the seafood sampler and the lobster was on par to something you would get at Red Lobster (it was small and overcooked)-seriously.  My husband had the seafood quad (not on the menu) and said all of the fish (except the tuna which was served raw) was overcooked.  We did enjoy the beef spring rolls; although the presentation was really odd...they looked like three soggy cigars when they came out; but they were delicious.  Finally we had the chocolate desert that you have to order ahead...I had one bite; it was not worth the calories.  We did enjoy the wine...Fess Parker Ashley but we found by the second bottle that we needed to move it to the other side of the booth because our waitress kept over pouring our glasses...it was crazy.

I wanted to go somewhere close to our house but didn't feel like steak.  A lot of independent restaurants are closed on Mondays so that is why we had to do a chain. I am not sure if that also explains why this place was so packed.  It may also be due to the fact that they have a great prix-fix deal on Mondays where you can get almost any appetizer, entree, and dessert combination for just $37.  Not a bad deal since we both left the place absolutely stuffed to the brim and we are both big eaters.

Overall, the service at this place is really great and the food is prepared well.  I really enjoyed our visit there but I would never really become a regular since for some reason I am just not a fan of their menu.  I love seafood, but most of their dishes come with a ton of sauce or crusted or wrapped in something.  I think if you have fresh, high quality seafood then you should just let the flavor of the food shine through.  That's just me.  I did really like the taste of the wasabi sauce on my butter fish entree. I highly recommend ordering that dish. And also, their cocktails. I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced.

I think Roy's is a great option for happy hour when you are looking for something a little higher class than your basic patio bar or for dinner when you feel like a taste of the islands. But I can't honestly say I'm a fan, hence the three stars."}

The menu was huge, stuffed with seven pages and hundreds of choices. I ordered the Sourdough Patty Melt and an iced tea. It came with slaw and fries and the total was $12.29. 

My lunch arrived in nine mins, with most of the menu pre- or par-cooked. That said, my fries were still crispy/fluffy. My patty melt was over cooked but still juicy. I like the grilled onion slice inside. 

My server, Darryl, was attentive to a point. A bit over the top with his semi-real concern for my service."}

Food: I was only here for desserts since we already had dinner before coming here. We ordered a mango flavor drink and it was decent. The huge chuck of ice makes it hard for me to drink through the small straw. We also ordered a cheese cake as well as Brooklyn 7 layer of chocolate cake. If you like the taste of sugar (I mean, nothing but sugar), you might like these dessert. Not only I do not taste the chocolate, I can't really taste the flavor of cakes neither.

The Mac and cheese had a gritty texture that was quite gross.

The fish itself was Amber Jack and quite overdone.

if you are Polish and see that they have pierogi on the menu, don't get your hopes up--this is a Jewish Deli and the pierogis are overdone and dry and don't taste at all like you would expect.   Same if you are Mexican and get the Albondigas soup. Not dry, but definitely an odd flavor.

They do have some sort of a "boot camp" breakfast menu. I haven't tried anything on there at all.   The lemon bars were good the first time we went, but not the 2nd; I was told it's hit or miss with the taste of those.

It's a cute restaurant chain in AZ with 4, I think, locations, and a NY Deli-type theme. There is graffiti, license plates from NY, sports pix, etc all over the walls as decoration.

Mostly we haven't gotten good service here. It's been a pleasant surprise when we have.  And if you go on a Sunday around noonish, they don't take reservations or call-ahead seating and it's normally a 25 to 40 min wait.  And if you have kids? The waitresses mostly forget to bring the cookie they get as part of their meal at the end. I didn't know about it and was surprised, and asked what was that for? She said, it's part of the kids' meal. 

oh, and if you go to the Tempe location? the manager not only doesn't care, but he can't read the handwriting of the ppl taking your name down, calls the wrong name, passes you up, and then when you ask why it's been longer than they said and ppl who came in after you are getting seated, he gives you an attitide and said he called your name repeatedly. We were sitting right there--we went nowhere, including to their bathroom, while we waited.  Not sure if he whispered my name into someone else's ear, but I'm not deaf. I heard everyone else's name being called, including "Jake" when there was no Jake. I'm pretty sure I was Jake that day, but they denied it and said there was definitely a Jake. Funny I saw no one answering them when they repeatedly called Jake and moved on to the next person on the list.  And it's really a tight squeeze in the Tempe location; the tables/booths seem a bit too close together, especially if you have a baby and need to use a high-chair."}

I went here this morning with the BF and a couple of our friends for breakfast. So the coffee here is just as atrocious as at the other locations.... it is so bad. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee with only half a creamer, but here I put in two creamers and it still tasted terrible. I tried something new today and got the Cabo skillet. It has home fries with bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, green chilis, new mexican chili, tomatoes, and scallions in it. Then they melt jalapeno jack cheese on top and put some slices of avocado on that AND it has two eggs on top which I ordered over medium. This thing was good. I mean super good! It was just the right amount of spicy, it did not need any salt and pepper (and I love salt and pepper on my eggs) and it did not need ketchup. It was pretty wonderful and huge, I couldn't eat it all. This is definitely the best thing I've ever had at chompies. Oh, so it comes with a bagel on the side, and mine was a little burnt.... but normally the bagels here are pretty good. The BF got biscuits and gravy and thought they were a bit too sweet, but I don't know about that because I don't like biscuits and gravy and didn't taste it. Our friends got a different skillet and an omelet of sorts, and both said it was really good.   Overall, this was a Chompie's win, especially in comparison to the last few times I've been and it wasn't so good. 

Also, bring back the Lovie's difficult decision! That was the best thing ever! (a piece of kugel, a latke, a blintz, and a cup of matzo ball soup.... all of my faves on one plate.)"}

I went there last night and there was a great improvement over my previous visit.  We were seated promptly as the restaurant was about half full.  A waitress came over fairly quickly to take our drink orders.  We both had their "Celebrate Fall" special, consisting of an appetizer of breaded prawns on a bed of cabbage leaves and a great salsa.  Really delicious.  The crusted salmon was done according to order, i.e., well done for me and medium for my wife.  It was served on a bed of baby vegetables and was quite yummy, no complaints there.  I also ordered a wedge salad as my wife and I were both extremely hungry, pretty much having not eaten lunch.  The bread pudding for dessert was nothing short of outstanding, served with a garnish of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream.  So, all in all, the food was really good.

So if the food was this good, why the three stars.  Well, for me to give 5 stars I would have to visit a restaurant several times and have a predominantly 5 star experience each time, so I'm no quite there with Roy's yet.  As I pointed out in previous reviews the food and service seems to be spotty, so I'll have to keep an open mind and return a few times to see if their game has truly been upped or if last night was a fluke.  Sorry to be so pessimistic, but my experience has made me very wary, considering that Roy's is not bottom of the barrel pricewise.  Four stars might have been appropriate, but there were a couple of missteps.  

To start with, for some reason Roy's is a bit slow on the drinks front, which is odd as most restaurants make a large portion of their profit from the sale of alcohol.  That should prompt the bartenders and waiting staff to get those first drinks out ASAP.  Also, because we were so hungry I asked if we could order some bread.  The waitress told me they don't offer bread, but we could have some complimentary edamame if we wished.  I gladly accepted the offer, but the edamame never materialized.  I was also never asked if I wanted another beer - same comment about alcohol sales.  I don't get it.  (As an aside, Roy's has no beer on draught, just bottles, but I shall not hold that against them in the review.  Again, beer on tap may carry a higher margin than the bottled variety, so why not sell it that way?  I'll let you decide if this is a plus or a minus.  I do find it odd, though, since most good restaurants do offer tap beer and in larger quantities than a 12 oz. bottle provides.)  Lastly, I waited a full 15 minutes to get my bill.  I was basically ignored by the waitress and had to get another staffer to lasso her and get my bill ready.  Oh, yes, during our meal, a gentleman, who I assume to be the manager, did come to our, and everyone else's, table very briefly to inquire as to the quality of our experience.  I don't mean to be rude or mean, but his approach was more perfunctory than warm or cordial, but at least he made the rounds.

All in all I enjoyed the experience, but since 5 stars are out for the moment and since there were still a few hiccups with service, the best I can do at the moment is 3 stars.  I shall go back since the food was so good last night and the service has improved, but still not as good as it should be.   I would love to give this shop 5 stars, so I'll give them a chance to earn it."}

Cheesecake is not a place that my husband and I would choose if we were out alone.  So aside from the occasional lunch salad while shopping or getting cheesecake to-go, we haven't been here in a long time.

My #3 son chose Cheesecake for his birthday dinner.  Items ordered included calamari (same at all chains), fried mac and cheese appetizer (delish), Chicken Maderia (sweet, tender chicken), Low-calorie chicken and asparagus (boring, but served it's purpose), 4 cheese pasta with chicken(huge portion, but again same as any chain), buffalo blaster (fried  boneless chicken wing something), kids quesadilla (over priced for tortilla and cheese), farmhouse cheese burger (good, not great).

We had 4 cheesecakes...Key lime, red velvet, apple caramel struesel, reeses peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake.  All were FANTASTIC!

The cheesecake will always be the 1 thing that keeps us coming back.  I still think everything is overpriced, but at least they are consistent. 

Service was good this time.  When we left, they were on a wait, but there were tables open everywhere.  Clearly a staffing issue, but I am sure frustrating to customers."}

I have come to the conclusion that the Cheesecake Factory needs to find out what they want to be. Do you want to be a Mexican restaurant? A steakhouse? An American grill? Clearly this mix match of food and seven menu pages worth of choices has worked for them for a long time but my belief is that you can't do something great if you try to do 100 things at one time. Too many menu items! While variety is nice, the menu is overwhelming and the chef's have way too much room for error. My food has always been just okay here but it is clear to me why. I do love the cheesecake. It is my favorite dessert so that is of course ultimately why I come here. I generally decide to make a meal of it when I do come here and often just wonder why I didn't just go to The Keg across the street. Why have a mediocre steak when you could have an amazing one? For now I think I will just stick to The Cheesecake Factory's namesake. How did a dessert restaurant turn into a free for all of tex mex, steaks, burgers, pasta and seafood, oh my!"}

At the time I was planning my first visit to Hawaii, and I was specifically avoiding Oahu and making a beeline for the Big Island so the final competitions on the Big Island captured my fancy.  Roy was a major judge in the competition.

The loss of my job nearly four years ago caused a major shift in priorities for me, as in no more trips to Hawaii anytime soon. Ditto for dining on haute cuisine. 

Somehow I stumbled onto the website for Roy's and learned about the Aloha menu.  With a five dollar price ceiling for drinks and food, I reckoned I could once again sample food that was the culinary equivalent of transcendence without feeling guilty about the expenditure afterwards.
So, I cajoled my meat and potatoes Midwestern beau into taking me to Roy's for an early light meal and cocktails.

From the moment we walked in the door, everything was perfect and professional- very professional. I should know, once upon a time I made my living in haute cuisine restaurants. I've always said it's easy to find great food for a commensurate price, the trick is getting great food without a hefty pricetag. Aloha hour at Roy's affords a person such as myself the opportunity to experience innovative cuisine and cocktails without forfeiting a necessity of life such as electricity for a month.

Getting back to the staff, we were greeted and treated as if we had arrived in a limo instead of a Tundra. Once seated in the bar for Aloha hour we were not subjected to thinly veiled contempt from the server who realized that the tab was not going to merit the same gratuity as a several course meal.  The hostess, our server, and the manager on duty were  all extremely cordial, polite and provided seamless service and even better food.  

The original hawaiian martini I ordered was prepared with top shelf liquors, not cheap substitutes to reflect the reduced price.

We loved the salt and pepper calamari, Waygu sliders, potstickers, and the sushi rolls with a spin.  For a fraction of the price of the average degustation menu we sampled the gamut of appetizers and several drinks- well, I had several drinks, not the driver.  As for ambiance, we were seated at a banquette adjacent to a very large marine fish aquarium.  The atmosphere was subdued, urbane, comfortable and the staff was attentive, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Since we were on a date at the time, the server offered to take our photo. It was presented to us in a paper frame shortly afterward.  That is a ready indicator of the staff's desire to go above and beyond percentage-motivated tasks for guests.  

Kudos to Roy for bringing the true spirit of Aloha to the mainland along with his unique fushion cusine in a sophisticated atmosphere that reflects warmth and the highest level of professional service for guests regardless of the bottom line at the end of the meal."}

I don't like the Cheesecake Factory.  I've tried it a few times, and I'm not a chain snob.  Bring me some Bertucci's and I'm happy.  But here?  No.  Just no.  I don't get it.

The food is utterly mediocre (I suppose what does one expect, from a *factory*), and personally I find the portions an affront to good taste.  They are disgusting!  It's like a trough.  Anyone who can eat a whole plate of their food in one sitting needs to get help.  It's also waaaay overpriced.  I guess you're paying for quantity, not quality?  I mean you get enough food to feed yourself for a week.

The decor is so confused and charmless.  I feel like I'm on an acid trip when I'm in there--an acid trip that's gone very, very wrong and you've forgotten that life isn't a Lewis Carroll-ian hellscape.

One extra star for good service and good cheesecake.  But overall I can definitively say I won't be back to this particularly wretched chain."}

After we were served and grabbed a slider we looked at each other in confusion because the sliders were almost cold. We flagged down the server and asked if they should be hot, she said that yes they are a warm dish and said that the food had just came up and walked away!  We waited for her to come back around and asked to please take them back and warm them up. I would have thought they would have either taken the fries or served with new "hot" fries to go along with the sandwiches. The side of coleslaw is a joke. Compared to the fruit you get for the same price. The sliders are always good, but the temperature and service, is reason for 3 stars."}

As I am from MI., I came to AZ to visit them bringing my 2 grandkids on this road trip. Of course, being the good son that he is, we all went here on our last night in town. And I wasn't disappointed.
Walking into his establishment, I was amazed at the colorful decor. Splashes of vivid color in a Hawaiian themed restaurant were beautiful. The 2-D wall art was tastefully displayed.
Upon being seated, our wait person, Anthony, was informative and gracious beyond reproach. From the 1st glass of water until our last bite of dessert, Anthony made our dining experience over the top.
We began with calamari. OMG !! Melt in your mouth tender & battered to perfection. Piled high bite size pieces instead of rings.
I had the trio which consisted of Butter Fish, Ahi Tuna & grilled Salmon. Each fish was drizzled with a different sauce which complimented each individual fish. To die for is an understatement. The presentation of each of our separate entrees was nothing but classy.
After dinner, Anthony surprised us with their signature pineapple upside down cake & chocolate souffle. Both desserts were rich & delectable without being sweet. 
As each of us ordered something different, it would take to much time to tell you what we each had. I would just strongly suggest that you make a date to take that special person in your life to Roy's for an unforgettable dining experience. Just ask for Anthony to be your server.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
Kudos to Roy's Restaurant & its staff of professionals !!!"}

To be fair, they have a menu that could be mistaken for a small book, and it is filled with unhealthy delicious options.

And there is our headline. There is an ENTIRE MENU of healthy options, and I mean seriously healthy. Kale is involved, and when Kale shows up, you know healthy is about to throw down. The options included a lot of sandwiches, which didn't work for my carb-averse diet, so I requested the most obnoxious thing on the planet: a lettuce-wrapped sandwich with a side salad.

They served it, and it was what health nuts would describe as "delicious". I am working my way there, so as of now I can affirm that it was "food". Still, I was impressed with their response to the bad rap, and the many options on their healthy "Skinnylicious" menu. You can have very green meals here."}

Shame because it was a nice night, and the patio was dead. The cocktail menu was fairly big and not badly priced at $6 a pop. The appetizers were fine, too. I recommend the sliders and the rolls. 

So why three stars? Because for a happy hour, it was all just meh. The food was fine, but not outstanding or particularly filling. The cocktails were fine, IMO, but others at our table found them too sweet. Very limited beer selection, too.

Looking at the regular menu, there's no way I could swing those prices for the plates I saw people receiving. I hear the chocolate souffle, though, is definitely worth it."}

The food is normally great.  5stars for the Matzo ball soup and for the sliders.  But seriously, where is management in this location?  Every time we walk in it's an uncomfortable welcome.  When asked, we say 2 for dinner.  And rather than a "please follow me", they grab the napkin set and a couple of menus and start walking off.  We never heard nor know to follow until they turn around, annoyed that they had to call you to follow them.  And rather than asking at the counter if you would like a table or both, you are awkwardly asking as you are standing in the middle of the dining room.  

It's VERY apparent that management has not done their staff justice in proper service training which in turn lacks in the service to your customers.  

I encourage the owners and managers to help make this place shine!  Show pride in your establishment and reflect the respect you have for it.  Be a leader and share your knowledge with your staff to set them up for success!  Right now, your not doing them any good and this reflects on you directly.  

Don't know where to start, I'd be happy to come in and show you!  This location can and should be the greatest and I'd do anything to see it shine the way it should!"}

The food is usually pretty good. The service is really hit-or-miss, but I guess that can be expected from a lot of restaurants. My dad was in town on Memorial Day and wanted a skillet, so I suggested we go to Chompie's because their food is pretty good. 

The first odd thing that happened is the hostess telling us "_____ will be your server, and he's REALLY great." We were all a bit confused by that because we'd never heard a hostess brag about the server before. Anyway. The server comes up to us and we tell him we're ready to order. He tells us that he can only take our drink order right now and he's going to take the order of the table behind us. We order our iced teas and he tells us, "Just so you know, guys, we've got a lot of people it's pretty busy here today, okay?" Despite there being empty tables around us, we went with it. Ten minutes later our drinks come out and we order the food, and again, he tells us "It's going to be a while because we're super busy, but I'll be sure to keep your drinks refilled." Sure, okay. Within 10 minutes we all had empty glasses. We watched him walk right by our table at least five times--one of the times he even bumped into me and apologized! I thought for sure that would get his attention but I guess not. Ten more minutes pass and as he walks by I try to get his attention for more tea, but I'm ignored. About forty minutes after we ordered the table behind us gets their food (the ones he had to help before taking our order). We wait fifteen minutes (still no refills) until someone else runs our food out to us, and it's ice cold. By this point we'd realized the hostess was probably playing a sick joke on us because she knew he was the worst sever ever.

Anyway, we're waiting for him to come to our table so we can pay for the drinks and leave, but he ignores us some more. He's standing at the table behind us and the guests ask how he's doing today, and he proceeds to complaint to them about how miserable he is to be working and how people are pissing him off. Then he walks right past us again and goes to the kitchen. At this point we just told the manager and left, who didn't even ask us to pay for the iced teas. I don't know why they'd let someone with such a horrible attitude even be on the floor. That experience really killed it for me and I don't think I'll be coming back."}

That meant we needed to scramble find a place for Christmas 2016 dinner.  Chompies was open and we called.  We confirmed that if we arrived before 6:30pm we would be seated.  Upon arrival at 6:10pm we were told that we would not be seated because the management had changed their minds about seating times.  We explained that we had called and were told 6:30pm to which we were told we were out of luck.  Now, typically this would have been an inconvenience but tonight we had our 89 year old grandmother with us for dinner. 

I immediately asked to speak to the manager and was visibly irritated.  A manager came out and I requested to speak to Mitch, the general manager.  Mitch came out and immediately apologized for the inconvenience, the misunderstanding and assured us that all would be handled.  The hostess staff informed us it would be approximately an hour before we would be seated, so we waited.  About 15 minutes later we were in a booth and ready to go.  

Drinks were served in a most timely fashion and dinner was fantastic!!!  It took a bit to get there bit  it was Christmas and the place was jam packed!!!  Absolutely will be back!  Mitch brought our food out and was an absolute gentleman!  We thanked him, apologized for our irritation and wished him a great holiday!

Service was monumentally terrible.  There were maybe 5 other tables of guests, so there was no valid reason, not that there ever is, for poor service.  Our waitress had the personality of a  paper sack and she may have been brand new.  Everything, from drinks to dessert was extremely slow in getting to us and some things had to be asked for twice, including a napkin that I did not have from the get go.  Food was okay, although our sesame cabbage salads had no sesame whatsoever.  It also seems that they consider ti sesame salad because the sprinkle a few sesame seed on it instead of using sesame oil in the dressing, if there was any dressing at all.  One order of fish was done properly and one was over done, both having been ordered medium.  My pork chop was very flavorful, albeit a bit dry.  I thought the panacotta dessert was great.  The restaurant manager was gracious enough to take some money off the bill for the two salads, since we had said they were disappointing.  I had been to Roy's before, once with terrible service and once with great service.  Seems to run a bit hot and cold."}

No server to be found. Upon asking of a server after being tired of waiting, we got one, who all night long was less than attentive. The only thing he did was take our order. Everything else; drink refills, food being brought out, bread, someone else did. It was as if we had 5 waiters. Our food took nearly 30 minutes. For two pastas. Which I will say, were amazing, I highly recommend the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce, it never disappoints. This location definitely needs some work though. And no, it's not that it is overly busy because it is at the mall, i've seen busier and bigger, some re training may be in order for the wait staff, or a reality check for management, since every table around us had the same problem even with different waiters/waitresses , and some even got tired of waiting for their cheesecake because they were "out".

We were here on a Monday at lunch and the service was top notch, the food was to die for and the decor was out of this world! We shared the skinny Turkey and Avocado sandwich which came with a wonderful mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was fab.

This is the second location I've been to. The first time was in Raleigh, NC and great food and service there too!

Some people just need to chill and not be so demanding."}

Horrible service today!  So bad, we had to walk out.  Terrible from the moment we walked in.  Was Not busy, yet hostess said would be a 15 minute wait, even though several tables were open.  Was told that we came during "their" staff break time.  Have never heard such an idiotic thing in my life.  Close your damn doors and shut down if you can't handle customers at 2:30 in the afternoon.  Asked for a booth for my family of 4 and told none available.  There was one right behind us that was clean and available.  Asked for the empty booth behind us and the hostess said that they don't have a server available for that table, due to current employee breaks.  Totally serious...it was not 5 minutes later that this idiot hostess sat a couple of 2 at this same booth that we (family of 4) could not have.  Finally, someone came to get our drink order and right away told us she is not our server but would get our drinnks.  Eventually we meet our server and first thing out of her mouth was "ready to order?".  We told of our booth incident.  She said sorry but tables are on a rotation basis.  What the hell this means, don't know or care.  She offers a booth for us, which we take and she walks off with an attitude.  We sit for close to another 10 minutes with no service.  Apparently, this booth is not her table so now we are back to waiting AGAIN.  We walk out obviously irritated over our terrible experience with Chompies and not one employee says anything to us.  We will never be back."}

It was a hefty gift card ($75) so I thought it would go a long way. Well, it barely covered our meal, which was during the time they called "brunch" that I was thinking would be like a brunch buffet. No, you had to order off a very limited menu, but the items on it were very good. Luckily they were able to accommodate hubby with a special vegetarian menu. I had a delicious mimosa (champagne and orange juice, I gather? Sorry, not a drink I'm terribly familiar with), they refilled hubby's soft drink before he even asked, I had the lobster omelette and hubby had some stir-fry dish with rice, veggies and tofu. We split a lime tart. I think it's a great, beautifully appointed place if you want to really dress up and go all spendy for a wedding anniversary or the like, but it's not exactly casual dining. Great for a once-a-year celebration spot."}

We decided to stay and eat so as I was looking through their large selectioned menu and opted not to get a bagel but pancakes instead. Not sure why, I should have stuck with just a bagel but nooooooo the fat girl wanted strawberry shortcake  pancakes instead....well nothing to brag home about. They werent bad but they werent the greatest either.

Large menu with lots of breakfast itrms and lunches, I will try this place again BUT probably stick with a bagel or breakfast item or even their case out front for a goody to take home ....There lunch menu wouldnt bring me back there.

We chose the crispy chicken spring rolls as an appetizer, our salads were fresh with a light and tasty citrus dressing.  We shared a grilled, marinated salmon and baked chicken; both were so tasty.

The manager comes along and apologizes for his mistake, informs us that he will return to get some personal information incase something goes wrong and needs medical attention. Never stops by! Thanks to my server for being honest and confirming it was a glass piece. At least she was honest enough.
Another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes-there were broken glass pieces on the floor- one of the servers kicks them like he was playing soccer in his own field.  Smiles and walks by! Really?? Were they going to wait for the worst to happen! 
How does the management handle both these situations apart from bringing this to their attention? They don't!! Just ignored it!!
Had I cut my mouth or my tongue- they would have taken actions? What if I had consumed small glass pieces in my drink? Is the solution to these incidents to ignore them and console us by paying our bill? No. I'm really disappointed with them. And will always think twice before walking in there."}

This was our first time at this location, and we LOVED it!!!! We went for lunch, and were seated straight away.
We loved everything from the food to the service!
Our waiter, Tom, was awesome! Super cool, chill dude. I love when waiters are just themselves around you, no weird vibes like they're trying to play it cool or be fancy. So ask for Tom!
For the food, I have Celiacs, so I had to get GF. But man that was probably the best tasting gluten free meal I think I've ever had at a restaurant! We got the farfalle with roasted garlic, I think? And it was just amazing! You couldn't even tell it was GF! I can't express how AMAZING that was. And Tom even said that most of their pasta dishes (and burgers) can be made gluten free. Uh major bonus!
And of course I got the chocolate Godiva cheesecake (cause it's the only GF option). But man it was wonderful! Very rich though, so you gotta love that intense chocolate taste!
I just wish it were closer, as I live in North Tempe. 
But I will most certainly be coming back!!!"}

I called right before I arrived and I was told they will send somebody out immediately. 5 minutes later a customer arrives and within a minute, the attendant comes out and serves them. I immediately talk to that attendant and he says they will be right with me. Ten minutes pass and I give them a call again and they said they didn't know I was out there waiting. Fifteen minutes now and another customer pulls up behind me and is served. The waitress had no idea I was there again.

When I asked for the manager the manager came out and said there was nothing he would do to compensate me for my time. He said that it is my fault for not letting them know I was outside despite the fact that I called twice and talked to two attendants about having waited for someone to help.

I understand that mistakes happen in the service industry but to come out after 15 minutes of waiting and two different customers being served before me and have the manager tell me that I was at fault was not worth an overpriced 60 dollar cheesecake. On top of that, the cheesecake was still frozen an hour and half after I picked it up even though they told me they had left it to thaw two hours before I got there!

I love the Poke salad. They made the best BBQ ribs I have ever had anyplace. I did actually lick the plate because it was SO good. The sushi rolls are good sized. The pulled pork is tangy, but not to sweet. All of the fish is wonderful. You will want to came back and try it all.

It was great that they had misters, but they need to turn them down because I was getting soaked! At all the other locations I've been to, the first thing the server does it usually place a basket of bread in the center of your table and take your drink orders. No bread. I asked the server if bread was no longer complimentary and she said it wasn't, but offered to bring us out some pickles (Which she should have done in the first place, in that case). Pickles were not something that I was dying to eat as an appetizer. Next, we looked at the menu. What a jumbled mess! The selection is awesome, but they had stuffed WAY too many items on a single page. I ordered the stuffed cabbage and when it finally came out, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. It tasted way different than it did at the other location. The meat was super bland, and kind of grayish. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location."}

We never went a second without full drinks and every other extra we could possibly ask for.  (Yes ALL NINE of us...that is no small feat!!!). Our table had so many different things such as my fave, the Jewish Sliders, my husband's new favorite, (and maybe mine judging by what I stole off his plate!). the Chicken Fried Steak burger...WOW AMAZING!....there were many others the Monte Cristo, Smoked Salmon, Matzo Ball soup, potato pancakes and of course some sweet potato fries and many other amazing dishes, not to forget the endless strawberry lemonades!!!   DELICIOUS!!!  
Thank you Linsey!!!  Thank you Chompies!!!

Since we have family in town, we decided to take them here the other night so they could sample all of the awesome. 

We went for dinner around 6:30p on Saturday night and I was moderately surprised to see that they were quite slow for the time of night. We were promptly seated by a very bubbly hostess. Our waiter came by shortly later and was equally friendly. There were 3 adults and 2 children in our party and we split 2 meals between us. The meals are HUGE!!! We ended up with leftover after sharing the 2 meals 5 ways!!!

We ordered the Jewish sliders and the Monte Cristo Sandwich. Both were very good, but the Jewish sliders were REALLY something special. My husband is Jewish and was raised eating his grandmothers authentic Jewish cooking. He said that the sliders taste just like something his grandmother used to make.

Our server was very responsive and anticipated refills that were needed. The meal seemed to take longer to make then I anticipated considering how slow they were. Since we didn't have anything else going on we didn't mind the wait. 

Bottom line:

* Food is awesome and authentic to NY and the Jewish style cooking.
* Not a great place to go if you are in a rush


We will definitely be returning to Chompies for more of their Jewish sliders in the near future!"}

My daughter wanted to go here for her 19th birthday, despite the last shitty experience we had at this location, but I agreed anyways. It was my mistake, I knew better. I haven't walked out of any restaurant, after paying, more dissatisfied than this place in over twenty years. I'd rather roll the dice on getting cyclosporaisis from a McDonalds salad than ever eat here again.

Wife got a seafood sampler plate with butterfish (favorite), salmon (close second) and Mahi Mahi (good but a little too fishy-compared to the others). 

Finished with a blood orange cake (shoulda done the souffle, live and learn) which was a little sweeter than I like, but still very enjoyable.

I've been coming about once or twice a month for the past 5 years, give or take. My recommendation- go ahead, take the time and read the menu. This place is known for their novel-length selection with literally hundreds of items and unique bites. Consistently mediocre service, great ambiance, and they always have exactly what you're in the mood for from sushi to barbecue. Oh, and cheesecake. Yeah that's pretty much the whole reason I love this place. 

Between friends and family, I've seen and tried a huge amount but my go-to is a dinner-sized appetizer with a few substitutions. It's called the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I substitute the noodles with avocado and the chicken with salmon. It's super healthy, the dips are to die for, and lasts me at least two meals. Some of my other favorites, and slightly less healthy options, include the Mac And Cheese burger and Chicken Bellagio (ask for extra sauce). You really can't go wrong with those. My mom swears by the kale quinoa salad and proclaims it's the best kale she's ever had. 

Okay as for the cheesecakes, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake is my newest favorite- replacing my previous favorite of Ultimate Red Velvet. It was seasonal this fall (2015) and became a part of the menu due to popular demand. I'm SO glad. I absolutely love cheesecake and have one each time I go. Other favorites include the White Chocolate and Reece's Peanut Butter Cup."}

We opted for the Jewish sliders and the New Jersey sliders. Each plate came with three sandwiches and we each managed two and took the remaining sandwiches home. We didn't have any of the corned beef but tried a sample and it was amazing! We ultimately opted for the pastrami, which was also excellent!

It was a rocky start, which dropped them from a 5 to 4 stars, but overall, the experience was great.

First, we arrive around 11:30am and there are a few people waiting. There were 2 hostesses and 1 server (I think) standing there chatting amongst themselves. They didn't greet us or acknowledge us at all. I finally said EXCUSE ME do we seat ourselves or how does this work? The hostess took our name and said it would be a 10-15 min wait, which I thought was strange since it wasn't very crowded at all. 

We did end up waiting 10 mins and were finally seated. Hostesses = fail.

Our server, Roxy, was AWESOME. The menu is so long and there are so many choices. Being our first time there, I had about a zillion questions and she was very patient and explained everything thoroughly, made suggestions, really helped us feel comfortable with the menu. She brought out everything so fast. I asked for a different drink because I didn't like the Arnold Palmer I ordered, and she brought a replacement in no time. We needed extra plates, and extra set of utensils because my 3 year old dropped his, and Roxy was on it. At the end of the meal Foxy brought my.kids 2 huge cookies (she asked permission first). Really great service.

On to the food...

To start they brought us 2 kinds of pickles - kosher and sour. Both were really good and crunchy. After pouring over the menu we finally decided on the Nova Lox bagel plate and the Dave's deli eggs benedict. Wow! First of all, these plates are HUGE. Don't expect to finish your meal. I was impressed with my bagel and lox plate. Served very traditionally - red onion, capers, cucumber...everything was so fresh and crisp...heaven! The smoked salmon aux really good flavor and texture. And the bagel...very fresh, toasted perfectly, really tasty, as was the cream cheese. Awesome execution of one of my traditional favorites. My husband had the Dave's deli eggs benedict which was perfect because it combined a lot of things we wanted to try- corned beef hash, latkes, eggs benedict - it really all came together beautifully. Great flavor. My kids split a kids meal - bagel and cream cheese and fresh fruit.

In short, the service and food were outstanding. I will definitely be back. And if they tighten up the front of the house and get their hostesses in check, I wouldn't hesitate to give this place 5 stars all the way."}

It's a love/hate relationship. My brother wanted to come here for his birthday, so we came. I usually get the deep fried mac n cheese balls (an app but I get it as an entree), but I saw they had it on a burger so I went with that instead. It was OK, but I would have rather gone to Red Robin. The caesar I got was disgusting. No flavor whatsoever. My  husband got the club which is HUGE and my brother got the three cheese pasta - they both liked their meals. 

You have to try the deep fried mac n cheese balls - they are what keep me coming back. The strawberry lemonade is delicious, but SO sweet. In fact I had just the regular lemonade this time and it was super sweet too. Pretty quick service and we were seated in less than 15 minutes even on Friday night.

Their Sunday brunch is delicious - lots of yummy options and you won't leave hungry!"}

I've never heard anything great or negative about the place, but the menu definitely made me salivate. 
The cocktails are great, fruity just as I like them. 
The wagu roll was good but it needed an element of crunch and some acidity. The lobster dumplings were rich but felt like they were missing something. 
I ordered the butterfish. Our server totally sold me on it because it's what their known for, but I didn't like it. The coconut milk was overpowering. The fish was executed perfectly, but all I tasted was sweetness. Way too much sweetness. 
The partner ordered the scallops and they were good but the park belly was more fatty than crunch. The fennel greens seemed out of place and didn't blend well with the other flavors. It definitely needed something else to make the marriage work. 
Dessert was ok. The lemon was a nice zing to a one note meal."}

The wait time for every thing we ordered was a little much, considering they were not that busy. Had the Lobster Bisque, very rich, and could have come with a bit more Lobster, and less croutons. Overall, the food was very good, so I'm actually between three and four stars. The wait staff is pretty attentive and friendly.

Granted, I typically visit the one in Tempe, but in my previous experiences, they've all been pretty consistent. Today, I ordered Chompie's Benedict. Poached eggs are always hit or miss at casual places, but I'd ordered this before with success at the north Scottsdale location. The plate came out sloppy, but that's not really worth mentioning. The problem was that one of my poached eggs was raw. Of course a poached egg has a runny yolk but runny whites? Nope. Not eating that. I sent it back and the manager came out to argue with me that sometimes poached eggs have runny whites and that's just how they cook them. Well, why was one of them ok and the other was a blister sitting on a piece of ham? She eventually only charged me for the egg I did eat, which is fine, but why argue with me for not wanting to eat a raw egg?

TLDR: Not going back to the Chandler Chompie's. Tempe and Scottsdale are still ok."}

The Martini, came forgot the olives and there was a lime wedge with the Martini, wrong, sent it back and was redone and all was well.

We started off with appetizers of Tuna Poke and a Signature Roll, both very good. For entrees we had: Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, and Tempura California White Sea Bass.

All were perfectly cooked and very good. I can't say anything bad, but for the prices, Roy's still had that "Chain Restaurant" aura about it. Can't put my finger on it, maybe the decor, the amount of tables, the scent or the lighting? I think its a great fine dining family restaurant. Would I come here for a romantic evening, maybe not. Service and Food very good."}

They did not serve complimentary edamame which I almost always receive.  We ordered the potstickers--overcooked and too crunchy on edges.  The waiter recommended the calamari--it came in a very sour sauce that was not good.  I wish they had served the calamari with a side for dipping.  Having lived in HI, I know Poke and I have never seen it served with green tomatoes and odd sauce--nothing close to authentic.  Butterfish and short rib dinners were both covered with the same tomato and onion topping--very strange.  My wife did not receive a birthday dessert.

I'm not a huge fan of reviewing store chains, especially restaurant chains. 

When I'm writing a review, I want to make sure I am adding something unique, that perhaps someone didn't already know. Since chains are everywhere, everyone has already tried them so chain reviews usually basically come down to rehashing information we all already know or become a report card on what we thought of the service.

It's easy to look down on chains or take them for granted because they're probably run by a giant faceless corporation or some big fat cat. 

One of the notable exceptions is The Cheesecake Factory. 

THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY: THE HISTORY 

The Cheesecake Factory started in 1978 from an idea that a son of a baker couple had to showcase his mother's cheesecakes, as well as to add a restaurant.

The Cheesecake Factory has a certain je ne sais quoi quality and is impressively successful operating on such a grand scale. 

What do I mean?

AMBIANCE 

The Cheesecake Factory is stunning and huge. There is the main dinning room, the bar and bakery areas. Each could conceivably operate on their own. The high ceilings with all the art work is pretty amazing. The craftsmanship of the bar is gorgeous. The whole restaurant is very well appointed. (see pics)

THE MENU

The Cheesecake Factory menu is massive. Not just in the quantity of items, but the scope as well. 

The menu features:
Appetizers/Small Plates/Snacks
Salads
Pizza 
Glamburgers/Sandwiches
Pastas
Steaks/Chops/Fish/Seafood
Eggs/Omelettes

There are 2 new sections:
"Super" Foods & Skinnylicious

"Super" Foods are nutrient rich special recipes with high sources of antioxidants. 

Some of these include:
Falafel Salad
Super Antioxidant Salad
Vegan Cobb Salad
Kale & Quinoa Salad

Skinnylicious are a collection of fresh & delicious menu options all at 590 calories or less. 

Obviously, desserts include cheesecake. 
Like ALL the cheesecakes ever invented!

Drink menu is extensive & creative. 

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

The Cheesecake Factory has a pretty consistent high level of service. Occasionally, there is a surly server, but it is rare. 

CONCLUSION 

5/5 RECOMMEND 

OF NOTE

*The Hours: 11am - 12am

*Extras:

Catering
Gift Cards
Ship A Cheesecake

Now think of all of those things I listed and multiply by 5 Phoenix Valley locations. 
(Chandler, Mesa, Biltmore, Kierland, & Peoria)
To have 5 massive restaurants all in the same city (over 200 locations total) and to be as successful as they are, for as long as they have been, is impressive and rare. 

The ability to just stop in to an epic environment with constantly high level & varied products and excellent service is beyond impressive, which unfortunately can be taken for granted.

Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.

The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?

I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling. 

The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door."}

The Macadamian Nut Mahi Mahi was better than what I read on the prior reviews and the dish was accompany with crisp cooked asparagus and properly seasoned potatoes. The chocolate flourless torte cake was the best of all. As I cut my fork into the delicious piece in front of me, I see a warm chocolate center oozing onto my plate like lava exploding out of a volcano.

I loved the decor and the hustle and bustle the place already has.  Great NY scenes all around blended in with an open modern feel.

Happy to be getting up early and getting some b-fast with my BF and even more excited to be getting out of our typical 5 mile radius.  Trying a new place was the cherry on top!

Chompie's menu is gigantic and I was only looking at breakfast.  So much to choose from, I almost felt lost.  Pulled my typical move of narrowing it down to two or three and ask the server.  He recommended the Athens Skillet (sauteed spinach, artichokes, mushrooms, onions, garlic, tomato, feta, and jack cheese topped with two eggs and served over potatoes). I knew it was going to be a ton of food, but decided I could take it home to enjoy tomorrow.

Three things made this experience not my favorite, mostly my own fault and having nothing to do with Chompie's.  1) Something was off with Google Maps, so I was not able to 'check-in' using the Yelp app, it said I was a mile away.  Bummer.  2) Attempting to take that first bite of my delicious skillet, I cut into the egg with my fork and received a explosion of yolk on my shirt and white shorts.  Ugh!  3) When leaving the table, I left my huge box of leftovers sitting on the table.  *tear*

What can we all learn from my mishaps?  1) If you choose to eat your egg yolk runny, pierce it softly before diving in or maybe use your had to cover much like squeezing a lemon into a drink.  2) Put your leftovers somewhere that you have to take them to get out of the booth, maybe in your lap?

We attempted to make a reservation for a party of 40 in their semi-private room for an event we were having five months later. When I called, I was put on hold for about 4-5 minutes for almost every question I had about the reservation because each person had to ask the manager. Why they didn't just have the manager speak directly to me or have the manager call me back at a later time was beyond me. 

Given the large number of our party, I figured would at least get the courtesy of speaking to someone who could give me pricing and requirements for the party - if not over the phone right then and there, maybe a few days later. But, instead, I got the "someone will call you a week before the party date" brush-off. I mean, c'mon - I was reserving FIVE MONTHS in advance! Could I at least get answers from someone well beforehand?! Needless to say, I quickly changed my mind and we decided to have our event elsewhere.

We were disappointed that we couldn't have our event there because we love the food ... But with how difficult it was to get answers, it just wasn't worth it. Subpar service like that would have ruined our celebration."}

Someone needs to use the restroom. If you ever have the need preparers be disgusted. These are some of the nasties restrooms in the in industry. The floors are covered in grease, they smell, they look like they are never professionally cleaned. Check out the partially alive cock roach laying on the floor. Then you have to touch the soap dispenser and the handles and the towel dispenser. 

Sure few people wash their hands thoroughly for 2-3 minutes with soap in hot water but most people don't use enough soap and clearly don't rinse for 2 minutes and the rest of the people, kids included, leave the piss and crap on their hands...and all that leave this room with the cooks, wait staff, hostesses, dishwashers, etc. fecal matter EVERYWHERE because everyone has to touch all that stuff. 

Back to the ROACH...well if there is 1 there is at least 1000. If their germs aren't enough then think of all that poison that is needs to partially kill this one. It has to be all over this establishment. Picture to prove it...check it out. 

Someone needs to call the health inspector and they should bring the roach patrol. This place is nasty."}

We shared a White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake. The crust of the cheesecake was a black cookie crust and was very good. The cheesecake came with two large  mountains of whipped cream, probably way too much whipped cream any person should eat in one sitting. Regardless it was a chill atmosphere, and the dessert was good. The whole place has soft music playing but feels very loud and is hard to talk while in there, not sure if it was the 3 other tables of people or just the architectural design of the place producing a lot of echo/feedback. I knocked it down a few stars for the service. Server did not come around often (or at all), had to get her attention before she would come take our order and again to get our check. Our drinks were empty and didn't get refilled. Overall, good cheesecake, bad service. No comment on the food."}

We went on Friday night and saw that they have an all you can eat fish and chips special. My husband asked the hostess what kind of fish it was, and she said, "cod, I would guess." Strange that she would guess about what they are having for the special.
We were seated right away and our server was nice. She took our drink orders and got the drinks quickly. She recommended the fish special saying it was great.
I ordered half of a corned beef sandwich with fries and my husband ordered the fish. While we waited for our food, someone tried to serve us the food from 3 other tables. I could see how that would happen once, but 3 times! 
My sandwich was fine. I ordered it lean, so it was a bit dry. Their fries are great - and they did not disappoint. The plate of fish and chips was heaping full. The fish looks like it's hand breaded as the breading was very puffy. But it was awful - the fish was really tough and nearly inedible. 
My husband left more than half of it on his plate, and the server didn't notice or even ask us how things were. When she brought our credit card back for signature, I told her that the fish was really bad, and pretty much inedible. She said, "i wish you had told me that before." That's all. She didn't even offer to share my complaint with the manager. As we left, the hostesses asked how our meal was and I again told them that the fish was terrible. They just kind of shrugged and said they were sorry - again, nothing was done to alert management or try to correct the bad impression left on us. 

Their prices are high for a casual restaurant, so they need to really do something to impress you to keep your business. They are not doing that.

I'll probably go back for sliced meat at the deli and maybe some baked goods, but not to have a meal on location."}

For desert I had the chocolate dish that takes 20 minutes to make (they tell you in advance, so that's not a problem) which was actually pretty good.

I also ordered a jalapeno margarita & they always come with the jalapeno garnish instead, this one came without. My favorite part is the jalapeño.  All in all they came & took $20 off our bill. Huh?!?"}

Well I have been eating waaay too many salads this month, so I was really hard up for some meat and some tasty animal fat... wasn't wanting to go all out, but I definitely wanted a non-salad meal, heavy with protein & animal fat.  I didn't exactly pick this place (it was more of a group decision), but it would have to do.  

Our party of 4 got seated quickly during prime Fri lunch time and commenced to read the literary novel that is their 15 page menu (ok, maybe more like 8)...  'I want some meat, a big ass hunk of meat... ooh, there's a mile-high pastrami... nah.. OOoh, how bout sliders?.. nah, too much bread..  fish?...ooh, they have all-you-can-eat fish & chips today???... FOCUS April! you're looking for MEAT... alright... maybe a burger?.. yeah.. gluten free bread?.. hmm.. not bad.. why not?.. oh yeah, AND with BACON on it.. and some cheese!'  There! I had gone through all my meat-options on the menu and settled on a huge bacon cheese-burger with a Gluten-Free bun and side of sweet potatoes.  

When the order came up, it was ginormous!  Actually, ALL our orders were huge plates, plentiful with fries and those who got mile-highs were also stacked high with sandwich meat.  We all walked out stuffed and some with to-go boxes.  I tried the fish & chips and it was decent (not better than the fish I've had at FIbbers, but decent).  I wasn't underwhelmed with my Gluten-free bun.  It was tall and had a small diameter (like a muffin), so it was very awkward to eat it as the 'bun' when the huge diamater meat patty hung over... so I just removed it and had the patty, bacon, and cheese solo.. and of course some fries.  BTW, their fries were, across the plates at our table, soggy and not crisp (my table partners didn't like that, but I love soggy fries, so I can't complain.. apparently, soggy is not the popular vote for fries).

All in all: quick seating at lunch time, friendly waitress did her job, manager came by to great us, food was huge portions, soggy fries, odd GF bun, great selection of deserts, overwhelming lunch menu... immediate lunch food coma."}

First off, the service is awesome! Matthew is extraordinary at the bar! He is very friendly, super-attentive, knowledgeable and generous. I recommend dining at the bar if you have the option.

Next, the decor is very pleasing. Though the locations I've been to on the Islands (Kauai and Ko'Olina) are wonderful just because it is Hawaii afterall, the design of this location is more aesthetically pleasing and intimate. I've dined here a total of three times now - twice in the bar and once in the restaurant and I find it very enjoyable.

Finally, the food is consistent with all other Roy's locations, which is very good. Tonight I enjoyed the potstickers and had just an "okay" experience with the seasonal salad only because I didn't inquire about the dressing (didn't pair well with my wine). Matthew was kind enough to bring me something to clear my palate afterwards so I could enjoy the remainder of my wine. From my recollection of the other two visits, I remember the food to be quite enjoyable (I believe I had the butterfish at least once and maybe even twice).

When in Chandler, Roy's definitely ranks highly in my book. I almost went somewhere else to expand my experience when in the area, though am glad I didn't. 

I've dined at several other Roy's just for context: Kauai, Ko'Olina, San Francisco, and Carmel and this is one of the nicest. Who knows, I may be visiting the Ko'Olina location again in just over a week..."}

Even thought I explained that everyone was on the way she would not sit the 4 of us that were there early.  

Upon sitting down, our waiter was very accommodating.  Brought us all waters and took drink orders.  After browsing the extensive menu items I choose a turkey sandwich from the skinny menu.  Food took a while to come out of the kitchen & my niece waited the longest for some kid sliders.  I was literally done with my turkey sandwich before they brought out her sliders.  Not sure what happened in the kitchen to forget about 2 small sliders.  I'm not a fan of the decor of Cheesecake factory or the sitting arrangement made for a large party.  I felt trapped where they sat us.  

After dinner was over we all ordered some cheesecake, because why not?  We opted for the brownie sundae and a slice of cookie dough cheesecake.  No complaints in this department.  Both good options for dessert.  All in all I wouldn't eat here again.  The food is OK and the service is OK.  Some people rave about this place, but for the price of the food I know I can have a better dining experience somewhere else."}

i made my special birthday dinner reservation and was even excited that they answered the phone with a friendly 'aloha'.

as expected, we were seated at a nice, intimate table. the one thing i love about roy's is how personalized he makes your experience. because they knew i was coming in for my birthday dinner, they made a nice little insert for the menus brought to our table. when we were done ordering, they rolled the inserts up and gave them to us to have as keepsakes. 

our server was gracious and kind the entire evening. 
the husband had a combination of two types of seafood -- fish and scallops (that were hugeeeee!!) and i got the filet mignon. everything was cooked to perfection. of course we had to get the chocolate soufflé for desert. you can't ever go to roy's and not get chocolate soufflé. it should be against the law. it has to be the best desert on the face of the earth [in my humble opinion]. to top that off, they even brought out their signature flourless chocolate complete with candle and our server took our picture and framed it to also take home.

we both left fat & happy. if i could have it my way, i'd choose roy's restaurant for every special occasion we celebrate because the people that work for roy always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect.

We wanted our check, a to go container, and had ordered cheesecake to go at the end of our meal. She forgot about our previously ordered cheesecake and when she finally brought it, we had been waiting 20 min at this point. Not everybody that goes out to eat wants to be there for over 2 hours. The waitress had a lame made up excuse that the dessert counter was backed up. What a lie as we could see it from our table and it was dead. She just waited so long to go over to get it. She never refilled our drinks. The actual cheesecake I ate at home, "chocolate chip cookie dough" was tasteless and dry. Maybe I should have given 1 star but I do love the Asian chicken salad and my husband enjoyed his filet mignon. Eating out shouldn't be such a pain. The acoustics are also bad.

My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying.

I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect?? 
He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left.
Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!! 
The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying "May I say 'Sorry' to you?" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.

Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!"}

The bartender was a little rude, maybe just aloof...but definitely not put together. I don't understand why management wouldn't want their bartenders to look presentable especially when working at a nicer restaurant. Does it really take a lot of effort to brush your hair or put on a little makeup..she looked like she just rolled out of bed to go serve her local dive bar. Makes me feel like I'm at some hole in the wall place. Didn't help that another bartender or server who was tabbing someone out in front of me put the persons credit card in his MOUTH while he messed with the screen. Come on, seriously. 

Besides that the ambiance was fine, I sat at the bar on a Friday and while it was busy, you could still get a seat pretty quick. The ribs for $7 happy hour price were AMAZING. You get 4 and they slide right off the bone. Can't say enough good things about them and everyone was ordering them. The lobster potstickers were sooo good too, definitely will order again. We also tried the mac and cheese (didn't like them - it was more noodles with not enough flavor or cheese), and the crab fried rice (I liked there were big pieces of crab in them, would probably get again). 
It's a good place to try, I'd like to go back for their full dinner menu."}

I ordered the filet mignon and what I got did not look nor taste like the filet mignons I've ever had before. It was a flat piece of meat that was overly charred and burned on the outside and covered up with some kind of weird sauce that didn't taste very good. My husband got the Roy's trio that came with ahi tuna, butterfish, and salmon with a side of rice. He didn't like the ahi and said it tasted funny and the other two fishes were just ok. Our server took forever to come back after we got out food to ask how things were and we wanted to ask for hot sauce and a redo if the steak but the time we waited for him to come back just wasn't worth it.

Our eating utensils were dirty and spotty, we were told by the waitress that polished silverware is reserved for evening dining (unbelievable)! The manager returns to our table with the explanation, "you all caught me in the middle of polishing the utensils"...so she gave us a clean set. Then we wanted to try the grilled shrimp and was told the shrimp was for evening only, but she would ask the chef, and were presented with a large plate and four small shrimp for $16. she explained the small shrimp were $4 each, a price invented because the appetizer is not on the menu. Needless to say we will never return."}

I have to say, my experience tonight at Roy's was pretty fantastic.  Service was great.  The bar was quiet and not too full.  A menu full of unique Hawaiian inspired cocktails to choose from and wine and beer all for $5.  Six different, all delicious, $5 appetizers to choose from including lobster pot stickers, sliders w/sweet potato fries, beef skewers, ahi tuna roll, salt and pepper calamari, and one more lobster one . . . I forget.  The calamari and sliders w/fries were my favorite.

This is a great place to go when you want a good happy hour, but aren't looking for the crowded, busy spots.  This was a great place to eat, drink, and catch up on conversation.  

While we were lingering around waiting for our friends and after finishing our food, our server was great about checking in, but not too much.  Making sure we didn't miss happy hour, but not pressuring us either.  Never felt rushed or that we were putting her out by trying to get one more appetizer in just under the wire.

And the drinks were great!  Normally, the fruity drinks don't appeal to me.  But with names like Basil Cucumber Collins, or Cilantro Cucumber Margarita, Pineapple Ginger Mojito, Lemongrass Sake-tini, (the list goes on and on) I couldn't resist.  AND, the wine was great, had a glass of the Malbec.  BF liked his beer.

Oh, and all of this Aloha goodness . . . DAILY . . . 4:30-6:30!  Nice!

This place is a little loud.  Not sure why.  It wasn't even full.  But it was loud.  Nice ambiance other than the 'loud'.  An understated tropical feel. I could do without the TV's in the bar, or at least partition them better.  Made the place look like a sports bar (there was some sort of sporting event going on).  The fish tank is nicer but too small to see everywhere.

This was our anniversary.  I expected the place to be full so I made reservations ahead of time.  They asked if we were celebrating anything, and they do a few special little things for your event.  That was nice.  There were three menus.  They had a special three-course meal menu (which my wife ordered), a one-page special drink menu (I didn't really look closely at that one), and the main menu.  The main menu is probably about 1/2 drink menu (the first two pages at least).  The waitress was very professional and explained the different menus, and then made some recommendations.  I went with the grilled ono (a type of fish) because she said it was a house specialty.  I also got the poke appetizer because I like poke.

So the appetizers arrive.  My wife chose the calamari salad as part of her three-course menu option.  I tried it.  It was good.  Not extraordinary, but good.  I did think adding heat to it was a bit odd.  Calamari isn't a strong flavor and you're going to add jalapeño to it (or whatever chile it was)?  I know you want to set yourself apart, but that doesn't seem like an appropriate match to me.  I will be returning to this theme shortly.  The poke was good.  I thought a bit too much avocado with it, but I could taste the poke.  It came with chips which would have been good for scooping, but the chips overwhelmed the poke.  Maybe it was the combination of a lot of avocado with the chips that dulled the poke too much, but I just ate it with a fork instead. It would have been better to emphasize the tuna in the poke. 

My wife's entree was the mahi mahi.  By itself it wasn't really very good, but there was a little puddle of dipping sauce (green).  If you used that it was much better.  That flavor combination seemed to work reasonably well.  The kimchee pancakes that came with it were OK.  Not great.  Dipping sauce didn't help.  My ono was fine, if a little sour.  Delicate flavor that they didn't seem to do much with that I could detect.  Just grilled it, maybe some lemon juice (I assume since it was a little sour).  It came with a cheesy risotto that was too strong for the fish, but did counteract the sour.  It was good risotto, but I couldn't taste the fish at all.  So, again, we have a flavor combination that didn't seem to work right.

Presentation was impeccable for all dishes. They clearly paid attention to that detail, which is nice.  Service was pretty good.  Just about the time you started to wonder if they were going to check on you, they checked on you.  A little slower than other places, but at the same time they're giving you privacy for your dinner companion.

The last course was a chocolate souffle, and it was great.  A lot like a lava cake (really hot chocolate sauce inside).  It was probably the best thing we had that night.  My wife also really liked her mango "martini" (actually it was a mango-rum drink).

So in summary, we had flavors that didn't seem to compliment each other well in at least two things we ate.  Presentation was expert, service was good, the little extras for our anniversary were nice.  But I can't say I'm a fan, especially at these prices.  For the price paid the food should have been a harmonious symphony of flavors, not a dischordant attempt to partner mismatched flavors.  If you're going to try to be high-end and charge high-end prices, your food has to be high-end too.  And it just wasn't.  I'm willing to concede it may have been a function of what we ordered.  The mahi mahi with green sauce worked, but it's weird that two of our items didn't quite hit the flavor harmony that they should have.  I'm going with three stars (barely) because of the mahi mahi, the chocolate souffle, and the poke (without the chips).  But I would only recommend it with the caveat that maybe if you order something different you might have better luck with the flavor symphony."}

The last guy was completely apologetic, but not apologetic enough to get a manager to open the locked door after I discovered our strawberries for the strawberry cheesecake (you pay extra for them) were not in our bag. We were in the mall. The mall doors were locked, and we were trying to go back out the door we came in. He made me go outside around to their front door to bring me the strawberries. I'm glad some lady was coming out the mall door and held it for me to go back in, or I'd have had to walk all the way around the mall to my car in the cold w/o my coat or my family, who were way inside and I said I'd be right back.

People must like it despite the high prices, because it's usually packed and there's always a wait if we want to eat here. I've just had bad experiences getting the to-go bakery items."}

Anways- started with the calamari and it was delicious.  This red sauce they have is really spicy and sweet at the same time and we asked for another serving of it.  The server told me she could write down the recipe but I told her no need- I am far too lazy to actually "try" and recreate it.  But the thought was nice.  I ordered this macadamia crusted mahi-mahi.  My dish came sitting on top of some mashed potatoes with 3 sticks of asparagus and 6 chopped slices of red potato.  I thought my dish was filling also.  bill was $99 bucks total with each of us getting one alcoholic beverage.  If i do return it will be for the calamari only."}

The boyfriend and i hit up Roy's on a Friday night. We didn't have reservations so we were offered a table in the bar. The bar isn't very big but it was full so it was pretty loud. The noise was a tad distracting so I might try the dining room next time.

But other than that we had a nice time. I ordered a Mai Tai to drink and the Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi for my entree. Boyfriend ordered the filet. The Mai Tai was yummy and rummy. Although a bit on the pricey side - $12. I did not order a second. My Mahi Mahi was served with new potatoes and gravy and asparagus. The fish was done perfectly and had a great texture and flavor. The potatoes were nice and tender and the asparagus was good too. The portion of the fish was quite large.
Boyfriend's filet was tasty as well. Slightly more done than he likes it but not overdone. The steak comes with mashed potatoes (with bacon!) and broccoli. He did not hesitate in cleaning his plate.

For desert we ordered the chocolate lava cake. Maybe I was just too full but I found this to be a little underwhelming. The ice cream was more like frozen yogurt and while the cake was full of oozing chocolate it just didn't have that decadent chocolate taste I was hoping for.

Overall I was very happy with my night at Roy's. I would definitely go back."}

Even the upside down pineapple cake didn't have happy anniversary on the plate. Super disappointing. Good food and cocktails overall, though. But my rare filet was more medium rare. Our waiter didn't check back to make sure all was good before we were mostly finished. And we got a frown when we tried to use a $20 off coupon.

However, I have been to many Roy's around the country, and I have enjoyed them all.  This particular Roy's stands out and is by far the BEST of them all!

They have a good menu and the food is always well prepared.  What puts this Roy's over the top is the exceptional and personalized service.

They really go out of their way to make you feel like a welcomed and valued guest.

The waiter made a few recommendations, which we didn't particularly enjoy, so after talking with us they immediately brought us something else that we absolutely loved.  This is a great example of really taking care of the customer and ensuring they have a positive experience.

I was very impressed, and I know that I will be returning to this Roy's when I am back in PHX."}

And our food was not that good. The waitress took 20 minutes to get my wife a drink. I had to ask the manager to find out where The drink was. When our food came the mashed potatoes were cold my kids pasta was overcooked and gross. $13.95 for a kids meal?  They charged us $17.50 for soda water. The "butterfish" was decent, but the bottom of the fish was gray and smelled very fishy.  BTW, it was Cod they told me.

Overall I will never come back to this restaurant. It's a shame after all these years this place is going downhill. We went on a Tuesday night, thinking we should get a pretty decent service. Boy were we wrong. We were celebrating a graduation, and this was definitely not a way to end the night.

If you want to pay an absorbent amount of money and have terrible service this is definitely the place you should go."}

I take my in-laws here for dinner each Christmas, when I cash out some Amex points for gift cards. This is a nice upscale establishment, with an accessible waitstaff and bar crew. Everyone is very friendly and quite knowledgeable about the menu.

The group favorite here is the prix fixe menu, which gets you three courses. The entrees have varied - the last time I was there only one fish option was listed as the entree. (This is odd for a Hawaiian fusion place.) The short ribs I had instead where quite good, however.

The bar crew here is very good, and they make a killer mojito. No beer on tap, though, which is disappointing. (A nice draft Sapporo would go quite well with the fish.) 

The atmosphere is upscale casual, so you can get by in nice pants (even jeans) and a nice shirt. Don't be that guy in the baseball cap, though."}

I ordered the Filet Mignon, which came with a bernaise sauce, grilled asparagus, and cheesy mashed potatoes. YUM! My husband had the butterfish with forbidden rice. So delicious, melt in your mouth, sweet, absolutely perfect. We normally don't order dessert, but we splurged and ordered the pineapple upside down cake. It came with a side of homemade coconut ice cream. My hubby is normally repulsed by all things coconut, but he devoured it! Truly one of the best date nights we ever went on.

Dusckhorn vineyards ran this event, throughout the dinner, giving a short history of each wine paired with each dishes. the 5 wonderful dishes were Hawaiian Kampachi, Lobster Dim Sum, Kurobuta Pork Kakuni, Shoyu Charred Ribeye and a Mille Feuille for desert.

The building is a bit nicer than what I've seen at others, but that's about all that's different.

I think this is a kind of place that is great to go to once for the show, or maybe if you're taking someone that's never been before, but after that, I don't see any reason to pay the price they expect for the food.

It's a great show, and the food I had the other day was pretty damn great, but I wouldn't pay that amount again.

The service at this one was ok.  It took forever from when we palced our order to get the chef out there to start cooking (Yes I know he probably has to get his mise en place ready once he receives the order from the waitress), but we were waiting for quite a while.  Also, at the end of our meal, it took an equally long time just to get the bill.

One nice thing they do is if it's someone's birthday, they take a picture and print it out for you right there...so that's a kinda nice touch."}

No other place can satisfy me bc I am not a meat eater it sorta freaks me out. But the pepper rubbed sirloin I had was really really good and my boyfriend got the delmonico because they ran out of the prime rib he lives for but this was a great replacement for him. That was probably the only downfall of our first time visiting since we chose this place for him to have the prime rib but it was a great experience our server Drake was great and I believe it was the manager that came to our table and told us about the prime rib that they usually keep a few pieces in case someone really wants the prime rib but he didn't get it bc of the temperature so he went for the delmonico since he loves rare steak. So for steak eaters it's a must try place (pricey so come for occasions) and there were some great seafood options for me but I figured I would try a steak and I was very satisfied.

My only complaint is that the prices are a couple of dollars high.  I get the same thing everytime - Colorado Chicken Salad with Salmon instead of Chicken.   It costs about 15 bucks with the substitution.  Generally, it would not be quite enough for my dinner, but they serve a delicious bread and butter for free.  The salad is very good as it is not just salmon plopped on lettuce; there are plenty of other ingredients - read the menu to see what the other ingredients are but i think cranberries, dried pecans, crumbled bleu cheese are a few.  Also, the salmon is a full piece, probably 8 ounces or so.  My fiance usually gets the Shrimp and strawberry salad with seared ahi instead of the shrimp - she loves it.  It is quite a decent sized piece of tuna, sliced thinly - about 5 times the amount that the nearby cheesecake factory serves in their ahi tuna salad.

Importantly, everytime I go here, the service is outstanding."}

This place has a great atmosphere and superb food all around. I tried the crab-cakes on the recommendation of another on yelp and have to admit they were very good. The only downside to this dish, was that there were only two crab-cakes on the plate and when they were gone, I was left with a feeling that I wanted more. The sauce for the crab-cakes was delicious and blended well with the crab and was delicately adorned with cabbage and veggies (very nice presentation).  I ordered the Grilled Mahi for the main course that which comes with a pineapple salsa and a side of your choice (my choice was the vegetables). This dish has small chunks of pineapple, served over a perfectly grilled filet that was moist and very flavorful. 
The vegetables were tasty and not under or overcooked (perfection). The service was great too, and our waiter Isaac, was fantastic, prompt and friendly. The manager also paid a visit to our table to ensure our meal and service was perfect (quality control).  My wife had the Ribeye steak and she said it was one of the best she's had. Our two friends also had the Ribeye steak and they also said it was fantastic. This was a great dinner experience with great friends at a great restaurant (3 Gs).
I will definitely return to try other dishes on the menu and will put this place on the rotation. Easy to rate
this place with a perfect "5" Stars."}

I you ever need a place to take a really big group of people, this place can accomodate but you probably need to make reservations in advance as it is a popular place. Service has always been very decent. Can't speak to the prices since it's usually some big boss footing the bill. I've come here enough to have tried most of the Firebirds Specialties - Wood Grilled Salmon, Steak Au Poivre, Pecan Crusted Trout, and American Kobe Meatloaf. All were pretty good though I think I've had the meatloaf more times than any of the others. They have salads and burgers as well - something for everyone. I think we once hung out at the bar area where they had these huge jars of pineapple slices as well - so this place accomodates pretty well if your party wants to still hang out after the meal is done and plates are cleared off the table.

I asked if that was really reasonable, given the size of the waiting area and the unlikely happening of all 40 people showing up at the same exact time. The manager was so nasty - he flat out said he won't do it - he will NOT sit a table until at least ten people are here.... I said, 10? Before you were saying 40.... so is it 10 or is it 40? He finally agreed to seat us once 10 people arrived... thank god. Please note that it wasn't so much the message that was so awful - it was the nasty tone and the body language. Granted, what he was saying wasn't what was agreed upon during the two phone conversations and the one face-to-face meeting about the event - but the issue truly was in the delivery. He was down right nasty.

Moving on to when we finally got seated...Our server Ryan, was AMAZING. He was SO friendly, full of jokes and always smiling. From the moment we got seated, the experience completely changed from an F to an A.

Carlos and Kevin were our chefs... again, amazing!! Friendly, accommodating, great at what they do... telling jokes the entire time and engaging their audience. 


I am amazed that the three servers/chefs were able to turn this around and make it such an amazing experience. They took a completely ruined baby shower and turned it into the party it was supposed to be.

We called to make a reservation but were informed that they are booked up and we would have to wait to get seating.  

When we first got to the restaurant we found the wait was only 15 minutes long which was great. 

We got seated pretty quickly and were informed that a server would come to help us.  While seating we felt that the location wasn't really that busy  as there were 3 teppenyaki tables on our side that were empty. After waiting about 20 minutes at the table a server finally came to take our drink orders, we ordered two different lemonades.   Later he ordered our food items: colossal shrimp dinner menu with fried rice, Las Vegas roll, spicy hibachi chicken. 

After ordering you wait for a cook to come to the table, that was an additional 15 minute wait.  When the cook comes to the table he confirmed our orders and began cooking up everything in a grand presentation.  

So, my personal opinion is that they take a long time to get you seated drinks and food served.  I was starving so I may not have been that happy considering I had to wait not for the table but for everything else, however I give them a PASS since they stated that it would be a wait.  The food did not taste that great, and the side sauces they give to dip things had NO flavor.  The Las Vegas roll that we received I thought had no flavor either.  Maybe my taste buds were off but I definitely didn't think there was enough spice in anything that I ordered, and my food was supposed to be spicy! 

On a positive note - my kids would have loved this place.  They really take the time to create a performance while cooking and I am positive that my kids would enjoy :) 

Maybe next time I will request a LOT of heat on my stuff and then it will be different."}

The service was great and all but the appetizers and entrees took a long time to get to our table. Also, when I ordered my steak I asked for medium well. They gave me a steak that was more than well done.. It was burnt, very dry, and hard to cut into! I complained to my waiter Daniel saying it was burnt and he apologized. He told his manager and his manager gave me the steak I wanted which was medium well. I was still a little disappointed because I waited half an hour for it to be cooked. My family was already done eating so I just told them that I'd take it to go. I was expecting a little comp for their mistake. Usually a good restaurant will do that when they make a mistake obviously this one didn't care.. I don't think I'll ever be back here and I didn't even enjoy my dinner with my family. If you dont wanna wait long for your food please dont go to this restaurant well at least this location."}

I am a huge seafood lover / self-designated crab cake connoisseur and it has been TOUGH to find any remotely decent here in the middle of the desert. My husband has even (jokingly) banned me from ordering them because I am always disappointed.
Well folks, the end of my 6 year search has come to an end. Firebird's crab cake are the bee's knees, the cat's pajama's, the stuff that dreams are made of! It probably helps that they are a national chain and not an Arizona desert location only, but they are here and they are GOOOOOOD. 
In addition to said crab cakes we also might have had other food, I vaguely remember some bread, my husband had the Delmonico steak and my main course a Cesar salad. I opted to add shrimp (did I mention that I love seafood) and oh-my-god-I-could-not-even finish them, they were wayyyy too overly seasoned and insanely salty. I guess you can't win 'em all.
Another small bummer was that they do not have my fav wine by the glass (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc). Only by the bottle. I don't like Sauvignon Blancs from California grapes (tastes like dirt), so I had the Reisling instead. Still good, just not my first choice. 
There does always seem to be a significant wait for a table when we come in. So perhaps consider making a reservation? We were quoted 25 minutes at around 8 on a Friday evening, but were lucky enough to score a table in the bar which is open seating. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Overall, 4 stars - enjoyable ambiance, good food, good wine, and fantastic crab cakes!"}

Everyone's complaints and comments are pretty accurate.  This place has gone down hill since last year. Honestly, I've always thought this place was over rated and more of entertainment rather than fine dining. BUT the happy hour deals and because it's close to home has always kept us coming back when we're lazy to cook. We recently were here for boyfriend's birthday and found out they changed the $30 birthday deal. Used to be towards any menu item, but now you have to order any teppanyaki meal full price and then get $30 off additional  items. Which is still not bad, but I liked old desk better."}

Experience #1: 2 years ago, my wife and I booked a party of 9 for a weekday evening. We showed up and the rest of our group followed. 8 of us were present and after 15 minutes past our time, they refused to seat us because our 9th was not there. Seriously!? ONE PERSON? We left and went to cheesecake factory.

Experience #2: This past January, my wife and I felt like we would walk in and use her birthday coupon on a Wednesday evening. With our last experience 2 years behind us, we went in with a fresh slate. The place was very busy and there were a handful of people waiting in the lobby. I was told it was an hour and a half to two hours to wait for the two of us to be seated. I turned to my wife and she said we'll pass, and once I turned back to the hostess and began to spoke, the girl turned around and walked away from me. What?! How rude!

So we make a reservation knowing its a busy place, and won't be seated (estimating: $25-30 a plate = nearly $300 of business) and just the two of us show up and we may not be seated for 2 hours? Like a previous review mentioned, they care more about overbooking reservations and leave no wiggle room for walk ins. Who in their right mind would go somewhere to eat and be told, you won't be eating for 2 hours! Absurd. The only way I'll give this place a third chance is if it's free, or someone else invites me to join them."}

I still rate this 5 stars.  They are still a bit pricey, the menu is basically the same as before, and the service is really good.

We come here every few months.  Usually on an occasion as this is a bit more appropriate than Outback or Chipotle for an occasion.  Today was no exception.  We received an email coupon for a "free side salad" (with entree purchase), which was a nice bonus.  My wife wanted the salad, so I ordered the kobe meatloaf.  She ordered some soup because we expected a relatively petite salad.

Well, we were wrong.  The salad was huge.  Filled up my wife so that she barely touched her tortilla soup (though she did try it and said it was very good).  The salad she chose was the spinach, and she loved it.

The Kobe meatloaf (with mushroom sauce) was OK.  Not as spectacular as I was hoping.  But it was good.  The mashed potatoes were good (as usual), and the beans had a nice flavor (not the tart flavor the beans of so many places have).  It wasn't a bad choice, but I doubt I would choose it again.  It just wasn't "special" in any way.  Not of the same caliber as the Aspen sirloin or the steak au poivre, even though the price was almost the same.

Still no wheat bread...but that's not enough to take away a star."}

I would crave a steak though (once in a long while) and where would I venture to? Firebirds, of course! I've been here countless times and the service I receive is always top-notch. Servers are always knowledgeable about the menu. The ambiance is a bit more on the intimate side: lighting is definitely low. We usually order bottles of wine when we come here. My dad usually takes care of that though, but always ask your server! They are quite knowledgeable about their wines, as well. 
So okay I had one mishap here once. We had a man serving us and I can't recall his name (this was post-veg) but I remember him being so sarcastic and rude about me ordering my steak not medium or even less cooked. Sorry, I'm eating it. I'm also paying for it. So if you have a problem with that, you obviously have way too much time on your hands and need to invest it into something else besides trying to facilitate what I am consuming. 

Anyways, besides that, generally everything goes well here and I never saw that server again so maybe he isn't around anymore. :) 

Oh. Order the brownie. I know you'll be stuffed after your phenomenal steak with potatoes, but this brownie is truly to die for."}

I surprised my wife and brought her here for our one year wedding anniversary. She had never been. I made a reservation at 7:00 and was not sat until after 7:00, strike one. We browse through the menu and we decide on our dishes. My wife ordered the teriyaki chicken and I ordered the Rocky's choice (chicken and steak) there were two other parties sat with us (I know this is normal and I'm not upset about this) both gentleman that were also at the table both ordered the Rocky's choice as well. As the chef was cooking, he cooked two and a half chicken breasts for the 4 meals that included chicken. I'm thinking to myself that hopefully he is going to put more on the grill. He portioned out one whole chicken breast for my wife's dish which I was pleased about because it was her first time and she was really enjoying everything. He then proceeded to cube up the remaining one and a half chicken breasts for the remaining THREE chicken dishes. Strike two. I paid for a whole portion of chicken and received about a third of a chicken breast. I am highly disappointed in this restaurant and will not be returning. I did not complain as it was my anniversary and did not want an issue, but looking back I should have mentioned it because the dishes cost way too much to be served like I was. This was supposed to be a special night for my wife and I and there was nothing special about taking her to Benihana."}

When greeted with staff, you notice that they are wearing special outfits that appear to be from Japanese culture with symbols on them. This small addition adds a touch of sophistication to the restaurant, making you feel as if you're getting the full cultural experience.

At a good restaurant, there should be background music playing just loud enough to be noticed, but not loud enough to the point you have to raise your voice to speak to your friends and family.  At Benihana, there was no music playing at all. Whether that means the music was too soft of there was none at all, I would have liked more music to be playing as I was enjoying my food. 

At a restaurant with good service, I expect a server who is respectful, attentive, asks how the quality of food is, and does things in a timely manner. During my experience at Benihana, the waitress was pretty attentive, coming by a decent amount of times, but when it came to quickness and accuracy of what was needed, the service was not up to par. For example, my friend asked for lemons for her water, and only after she asked three times did she receive them. While taking our food order, the waitress wasn't able to understand exactly what we wanted, and when she offered her opinion, was rude about it.

The chef was pretty cool... He also was very involved with the whole table, asking everyone what they needed and catering to what they asked. What made his service above average was that he got personal with us, getting involved in our casual conversations and giving his interesting input on whatever we were talking about. At other restaurants, they chefs can be tired, not wanting to do the usual tricks or lazy, and not interacting with the customers. This aspect of Benihana was definitely above average compared to most other teppan-style places.

Compared to other restaurants with the same style, overall Benihana is an okay restaurant that has some good qualities that make for a good dining experience. Although they need to work on some things such as music, parking, and service, I would suggest Benihana to families and couples looking for more casual yet interesting dining experience."}

This last time we went it was the chicken and steak for two and it was tasty. Make sure to ask for garlic butter on your entree if you like garlic because in my book it makes everything taste better.

Where do I begin with this place.  I took a young girl who turned 13 here yesterday for her birthday dinner.  She had a great time last night.  She ordered the Trio which was chicken, shrimp and steak.  The meal came with fried rice, soup, onions, squash and shrimp.  The food was really good.  The chef did a great job and made it exciting for her too.  The server did get a little stretched thought a couple of times.  It was okay.  When I needed water I just asked the server when she was scooting around.  I ordered the Trio also and it was good.  This place is one of my favourite places to eat."}

This time it was a party of four and we were dressed causal on a Thursday night. Again we fit right in. We went early because Firebirds offers a great early dinner meal from 4 to 6 Monday through Thursday. Everyone in the group was very pleased with their meal. The center cut sirloin is excellent. I also recommend the BLT salad. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations. A normal meal is a little more spendy than your average chain restaurant. The quality is worth it."}

One big turn off to me is this place tends to be very loud and it is difficult to have a relaxing dinner unless we get there early. The kitchen is open to the dining area and the dining area is basically one massive, high ceiling, room. Should have been designed better for a quieter, more relaxing experience in the dining area."}

This time we showed up for Restaurant Week.  It was a decent deal.  Hard to know if the portions were a little smaller, but the filet medallions with bleu cheese sauce on the menu is almost as much as the RW price was.  So can't really complain there.

I actually ordered the "flat iron steak" (which is a particular cut of sirloin).  I thought the portion a bit small, but not horrible.  The garlic mashed potatoes were a generous portion.  But I didn't taste the garlic like I expected.  Their signature Fired-Up sauce was too heavy for the sirloin.  Very strong flavor totally overpowered the meat.  It might have been more appropriate for a rack of ribs or something similar.  The meat was served in a puddle of that sauce.  I found a quick tap on my plate seemed to remove most of the sauce, and the little bit that was left was not too overpowering.  But they really should have used an au poivre sauce (or maybe a red wine sauce).  Would have been a better match.

The key lime pie was REALLY good.  Too much whipped cream, but that's easily removed.  Really good.

I wish I could go 5 stars, but I can't.  The sauce selection for my entree just did not work, and the garlic mashed tasted more like a cheesy mashed to me.  Not a lot of garlic (I really didn't taste any).  But I can go with 4 stars for now.  I'm sure we'll return at some point (we seem to come here a few times per year) and I will update my review again."}

Four of us were meeting for dinner at 6 pm.  I wanted their new Tempura basket (just got their e-mail advertising it) - not a chef's table needed item.  So I made reservations on-line and said I didn't need the Chef Table, figured why tie up 4 seats at a Chef's table.

I get there @ 5:50 to be told they don't take reservations for non chef tables which are actually in the lounge.  I go in there to see 3 regular tables...2 taken and another "reserved" how is that so?  The hostess says we can have the center table a large high stool pub table.  REALLY?  With a seven year old?  Let alone who wants to have a nice quiet meal in the "bar" with your feet dangling?   

Walked out and had a nice meal at Chili's next door!  From now on going to Scottsdale Benihana where they have a nice non-lounge and non-chef table area for people to have a quiet dinner...that's what I expected at Chandler.  

Also, they told me they tried to reach me.  No phone call, text or e-mail all day.  Come home to find they canceled my reservation at 5:53 (what while I was standing there?)
CRAPPY customer service!"}

I didn't realize it was a chain until after I'd made reservations. This would usually be a nonstarter for locavores like us, but the prix-fixe menu looked appealing and it was close to home for a weeknight dinner, so we stuck with the plan.

The place is BIG. Claim Jumper big, but not obscene like Cheesecake Factory. This was a bit of a put-off, but the dim lighting and well-spaced seating made it feel a bit more intimate. The smell of wood smoke in the entryway was delightful and did a good job communicating what Firebirds is all about. Both the hostess and waiter were polite and knowledgeable. Service was attentive but not rushed on what appeared to be a slow weeknight; we spent an hour or so enjoying our dinner rather than feeling like a "turn."

The Restaurant Week menu was a great bargain at 30 bucks a head for an app, entree and dessert. Learning that wine by the bottle was half price that night was just a cherry on top. They started us out with a nice bit of crusty fresh baked bread.

For apps, the boss had a crab cake and I ordered Firebirds' signature BLT salad. The crab cake was well seasoned, if a bit mushy in the center. The accompanying coleslaw was a split decision--I liked it, but she didn't enjoy the tortilla strips that were meant to add crunch. Honestly, the crisp purple cabbage provided plenty of texture. I'm not usually a salad guy, but the BLT was fantastic. The finely-diced tomatoes and abundant large bits of crisp thick-cut bacon appeared in every bite and it was tossed with just the right amount of creamy garlic dressing.

Our entrees were nicely prepared, which is a tall order when one of them is a pork tenderloin--a cut that's not naturally flavorful and very easy to dry out. Mine was done to a perfect medium (as promised by our waiter) with a moist, barely pink center despite a great char from the grill. Another half teaspoon of the glaze and it would've been perfect. The wife's sea bass was cooked and seasoned well, but the thickness of the fillet was inconsistent, resulting in slightly overcooked edges. The potato sides (chile cheddar mash for me and a potato pancake for her) were both excellent but overabundant. We sure would've loved some fresh veg instead of all those carbs (and plenty of butter, no doubt).

Our desserts were nothing to write home about. The flute of mixed fresh berries and cream was light and refreshing, but nothing more than you'd expect. The chocolate brownie a la mode was a bit dense and lacked the chocolate punch and fudgy texture I look for in a good brownie; it certainly didn't give the impression that it was baked in house.

With the exception of the potato sides mentioned above, portion sizes were appropriate--satisfying but not excessive. The prices listed on the regular menu for the items we ordered were pushing the limits of what I'd consider fair; they certainly wouldn't be what I'd consider a bargain.

Overall, we were impressed. This three-star review is in part a reflection of my personal preference for small, locally-owned restaurants with executive chefs you know by name. Compared head-to-head against its true peers (upper-echelon national chains), it's deserving of four stars and will be one of our go-to places when we need a safe choice for a nice dinner with a mixed group of friends or family."}

The food is just basic American: steaks, chops, and fish with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans.  But they do it well.  I think they make a pretty good steak but I love their salads for lunch or when I am in the mood for a lighter dinner.  Oh, and they have some decent burgers, too.  Wine list has some well priced bottles on there and they also have a list of specialty cocktails but they are sorely lacking in beer options.

Unfortunately, due to its proximity to the mall, the dining area can sometimes have a few overtired kids but if you arrive later or sit in the bar area it is possible to have a romantic evening.   They keep the lighting low and the music subtle.  The decor is a bit corporate but has its own middle America charm to it and adds the right amount of flare without being too over the top.  A solid 3 1/2 stars."}

Ultimately, it allows you to really get into how this restaurant works, but it kind of backfires:  I know enough to cook Japanese-style now for about 1/10th the price.   

The layout here is kind of weird.  Forget anything intimate--I was kind of fearing the placement of our largely dysfunctional get together near the rather normal couple, but it worked out well enough.   Problems arise in the layout of the place--everybody faces out a window with the majority having their backs to the entrances (I hate that).  The "view" is a massive parking lot bookended by a La-Z-Boy store and a Chili's.  Switching the layout of the place might have been a small salvation.  

What you're really getting is the cooking show, worthy of a sixth star:  our chef was extremely friendly and we had a great time as our food was cooked.  

But it's not a grand luxury, it's just Eastern efficiency.  You don't wait for your food, they don't have to hire expos, and they need less kitchen infrastructure.  As soon as the food is done, it's on your plate--the tradeoff of the show as I would have liked to have it all out at the same time.   Something is slightly taken away from it when the other chef on the other table does the train sound again with his butcher knife; It feels like a pre-programmed repertoire to go with the pre-programmed food.  This is why chains leave me bitter, even good ones like Benihana.   

The ingredients are nothing special--for a table of 7 they bust out a few zucchinis, a couple handfuls of generic white mushrooms, a couple white onions, small slabs of steak and chicken, etc.  What really gives this place its Denny's-plus quality was immediately apparent in the side salad--a bag of store bought mix and a couple tomatoes.  It appears to add up to a lot of food, but I've spent less at other restaurants and usually bring home a box.  

The sauces they use are what saves the place food wise, but they're all clearly pre-made elsewhere for a generic nationwide palette--the hot mustard just wasn't hot, at all.  On the other hand, the two ginger sauces, a red one in the meat and a yellow one in the salad were absolutely delicious.

Unfortunately, this place severely loses on price and service.  The server was basically gone the whole time.  Fuck her.  She splits her tip with the awesome chef and drags his performance down.  

At one point I got up and went back to the front end to ask for the bathroom, waiting impatiently for the hostess to finish chatting with a friend who came in with another table.  What the hell?  The bathroom itself was a sticky-floored mess--something I would expect at Veterans Memorial Coliseum or some douchebag bar, not a place that charges this much for dinner.  Drinks were extremely expensive, charging $9 for a 22-oz bottle of beer.   

The magic here is the presentation, the sauce, and the overall delivery, but it's severely hampered by food quality, prices, and poor service.  It would have been two stars, but I couldn't be angry at the place after having such wonderful ice cream and a picture (scantly offered as it were) at the end.  

Overall, Benihana is worth the one-time experience but needs significant improvement to happily lure me back as a repeat customer."}

I took my new girlfriend there for the first time last night 4/20/17 while saying that it is a great place. I love the fresh lemonade in a sugar rimmed glass and the Pepper encrusted steak.

We had a 10 minute wait to be seated, which wasn't normal for the time on a Thursday but neither of us minded at all. Once seated we were greeted by our server who was training another server (she was awesome for being in training). I ordered the lemonade and my date was not given much time to look over the menu before being asked if we just wanted waters to start. I had not even had a moment to look at the drink menu which had been with our server. I was looking for the Double Black Diamond Martini which I didn't see on the table cards or food menus which we were already given. I thought it was strange we didn't see a drink menu until after we had ordered our waters/lemonade. Also, we never received straws for our drinks throughout our stay.

I ordered a Double Black Diamond Martini and asked for Bread. I had finished the lemonade and moved the glass to the far end of the table, expecting to sometime soon get a refill offer or the Martini I ordered or the bread I asked for!?!. I do not know exactly how much time had passed but I was irritated, looking around and trying to make contact with our server. My date asked if I just wanted to leave but I did not want to accept poor service and leave to find another place to eat. Finally I got up and asked the trainee if I could get the drink and bread I ordered. While I was up I went to the restroom if nothing more to give the server additional time. When I came back my lemonade was not refilled nor did my date say that it was offered but I did have my Martini waiting.

Bread came shortly before the meal arrived and I was offered a refill on my lemonade and if I would like another Martini (I had finished it already) which I declined. Once the meal arrived my date asked for her own strawberry lemonade, both of them came back about the same time. 

I was only able to eat about half of my steak before I asked to have it boxed up due to having a headache and not feeling well. I would have written something last night but I only wanted to get to bed and sleep off how I was feeling.

Overall I think I was very disappointed with this visit and it has left a bad vibe for me and my date who was there for the first time."}

The waitress repeatedly sighed when we asked for refills. Plates were never even taken away. They brought the ice cream even and just set it in front of the dirty plates. I had to rush removing plates from in front of the birthday girl WHILE they were singing because they just shoved it at the top portion. Our waitress only started removing dishes after she saw I started taking pictures. You can see the piles of plates we started to stack on our own at the top right and my green tea ice cream set in front of my dishes as well as the multiple drink glasses because the few times we did get refills she just brought us more glasses but never took the old ones away. We spoke to the female manager who said she would take care of it and gave us two cards for chicken rice upgrades on our next trip with the purchase of meals. The male manager upon arrival who refused to take our electronic birthday card w free mug for my two daughters (both April) because we didn't bring it printed out which I have never had to do. We have gone to Benihana at least 6x annually and this is by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered. So very disappointing. I also emailed customer service and never received a response."}

When I asked if the wings were breaded, the waitress said she'd check and also bring me a gluten free menu which was astute of her. I do wish that they'd consider a separate fryer for non-breaded items so they could put more items on their gluten free menu, but overall it was fine. I ended up with a tenderloin and a baked potato.

Our server was Abdullah, very pleasant.
Started with the Arnold Palmers to drink. It was so sweet we had to ask for water to dilute it. Our waiter was very accommodating with that.
Appetizer wings were just average. The dipping sauce tasted like a ranch/ blue cheese mix & was extremely salty! 
My daughter ordered the Durango Burger, beautiful presentation & over all a good burger. It was a fair size that she couldn't finish. However, pretty pricey at $13.50
I had the Peppercorn Steak. $ $23.95. I was somewhat surprised that it came "pre sliced" in strips not as a whole steak?! The Peppercorn Sauce was ok needed a bit more salt & more of the sauce on the plate. I had to ask for a side of steak sauce. You'll have the option of a side excluding soup or salad, that is an addition cost. My first thought; was to go with the Parmesan Mashed Potatoes but asked the server about the Au Gratin & which he preferred. So, Au Gratin it was! Disappointed they were overcooked. It's offered up in a small ceramic dish separate from the steak. All the cheese had melted off & just the over broiled bubble residue coated the sides. It was oily & lacked in flavor.
I will say the customer server was good. We were visited by the manger who came over & greeted us and was engaging. Our server was professional, but the overall experience wasn't impressive for the experience & price."}

My 1 1/2 yr old loved the mac & cheese, a definitely more upscale version than Kraft, made with penne and a white cheese sauce. I recently had the shrimp, strawberry and goat cheese salad and I really enjoyed it. The shrimp were a tad too salty, but over all it was very good. I loved the jicama and spicy pecans, it added a nice sweet crunch. 

I must say that during one of our visits I was going to order the peppercorn crusted steak and the server was honest enough to tell me: Unless you reaaaaaally like pepper, you should order something else. I appreciated his honesty, because I was not interested in having steak with my peppercorns:) and I like (actually expect) my waiter to steer me in the right direction if I'm going to order something less than appetizing."}

JR ordered the beef sliders with parmesan garlic fries, Ron got chicken tenders buffalo style with the parm/garlic fries and l got the shrimp appetizer.  The boys liked their food. JR thought the beef sliders were over-done, thus dry. Ron enjoyed his chicken tenders.  Chicken tenders are made ready to please most guests as it wasn't spicy  (Rom prefers spicier flavors).

First the food and service. I ordered the hibachi Filet that came with the five courses. The soup, salad, rice, veggies, and meat. Oh, and a small amount of shrimp for an appetizer. 

Now maybe I'm spoiled because I'm used to Kobe's steakhouse when I lived in FL and NY. I have yet to find another Kobe style steakhouse that's good on its own let alone as good as an actual Kobe's 

This place is no exception. The soup was good.  The salad was not. The dressing had to much of a ginger taste. Obviously subjective. You might like it. The rice was very overlooked and bland. Same with the veggies and the shrimp. My wife said the same thing. It just had no taste at all. 

The Filet was a different story. It was excellent. I don't know how the cook went from making everything tasteless to making the Filet perfect but he did. 

Speaking of the cook on to the service. Is was very good. Our experience was a bit long (two hours) but they were busy so that's to be expected. They were professional and courteous. The cook did his part to be "funny". He wasn't bad. 

Having said all of that I'll never go back. One, the bill for everything was $100 and like I said 90% of the food was tasteless. Our drinks were good. I'll give them that. 

The other reason is their posted signs. One you see outside basically says they do checks on everyone they hire and the won't hire illegals. Only Americans and immigrants here with a work Visa. You know, the proper way to do it. Not sneak in and stick your hand out for free stuff and demand rights. 

That sign was excellent. The anti gun sign was not. And that's why I'll never go back. I'm not going to bring my family into a victim zone. Criminals simply do not play by the rules. I'm baffled that anti gunners actually believe signs and gun control laws work. They don't. Criminals don't care about signs and laws. 

And the only other reason not to allo guns is to not "offend" the anti's. I'm sorry but who cares about the feelings of people who are so naive they are basically children in grown up bodies. It's time to stop placating the children who's gun knowledge comes from Hollywood and agenda driven politicians and anti gun groups funded by Soros and Bloomberg. 

The restaurants that post these signs should be held accountable if a criminal comes in with a guns and hurts people. It's not like this already doesn't occur. Restaurants have to follow rules and codes so people who visit don't get hurt. Bad food. Poor construction. Basically a restaurant can't fall into disrepair and hurt someone. So how is it different if the owners willing create a place where patrons have no defense against a bad person with a weapon?  

It's time to stop supporting places that do this. It's time to punish restaurants who cater to criminals and naive "grown ups"."}

It's a little cheaper than in used to, as I usually only go to higher end steakhouses. It definitely has the wood fired feel, with brick/wood interior and a nice patio to the side. The servers are above average. They were a little slow when I visited, but nothing too terrible.

They start with cornmeal bread and soft butter. The butter melts onto the bread, and is so soft. I could eat four to five of these loaves and be one happy man.

Appetizer - lobster queso with homemade tortilla chips. Even though I'm not usually a fan of combining cheese and seafood, this was quite good. It also had a nice kick to it. The lobster was fairly fresh and cooked well.

Salad - wedge salad with bacon. Definitely a solid salad in my book. Nothing mind blowing, but solid quality.

Steak - 9 ounce bacon wrapped filet with a salted baked potato. For a more moderate steakhouse, it was really good. Sure, it's no Durant's, Ruth Chris, etc, but it was quite good for the price point. The steak was very tender and salted appropriately.

Cocktail: Benihana Plum Wine - from Berkeley (me thinks) $7.50 for the glass. This is a regular plum wine. 

Specialties: 
6 course meals comes with: Onion and mushroom soup, salad, sauteed shrimp, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. Served with their mustard sauce and ginger sauce. Steamed rice. Hot green tea. ice cream or sorbet. 

My pick: Deluxe Treat $38.
- Filet mignon (medium rare) and a cooked lobster tail with garlic butter and lemon. This is a normal surf and turf meal cooked before your eyes. 

The teppan chef first started with cleaning the teppan top. Oil, then made the beating heart fried rice (which is an optional for an additional $5). Next up is cooking the zucchini, mushrooms and making the onion volcano and choo-choo train. Then was the chicken, steak, filet mignon and lobster tails. 

Menu books changed from the nicely bounded one to the economical thin and easily replaceable, cleanable menu books. 

Overall: 0-star rating
Minus a star: Server failed to provide the hot green tea. 
Minus a star: Server forgot about the ice cream. 
Minus a star: Server didn't take, nor offer the birthday pictures
Minus a star: Server never refilled waters
Minus a star: Server messed up the checks

I doubt the birthday recipients enjoyed the birthday experience. Better dine on a non-birthday."}

Somewhere over the years they switched out the soft edible bun for a hard, doughy baguette which makes the sandwich so much harder to eat and enjoy.  Twice burned, I'll have to find something else on the menu since my wife loves (as in present tense) the soup and salad.  The french dip is definitely NOT worth anything close to $16.99, so I would not recommend it on that basis either."}

We have had some good experiences here, but the service has become unbearable. The last four of five times we have dined in at the restaurant we have had huge problems with service and always left really irritated. Ironically this was a restaurant that we used to have really good experiences at when we dined in, but the takeout was nothing but problems. Recently we have done much better with takeout, but now we really don't ever want to dine in at the restaurant anymore. I certainly don't expect any restaurant to be consistently perfect, but after four or five times in a row of being virtually ignored, and other problems, while dining at the restaurant, I think it's safe to say it's more than just an occasional problem, or just bad luck.

On this visit we went to the restaurant early on a Saturday, hoping to avoid a crowd, and hopefully get better service. Clearly crowds are not the problem. There must have been more employees milling about than there were customers. It started just like other visits, where it seemed like we were invisible. Adding insult to injury, we were seated on the left side of the restaurant where there were only a total of three tables occupied, and two waitresses waiting on them. Yet, still no one would come to our table and wait on us. Just as I was about to get up and ask someone why we were not being waited on, a waitress finally showed up. However, it was not one of the two waitresses working the tables around us. It turned out it was a waitress who was working tables all of the way on the other side of the restaurant, and working more tables than the two waitresses combined on our side. We were the only table she was waiting on that wasn't all the way on the other side of the restaurant. Why would they do this? The restaurant was less than a quarter full, if that.

Sure enough, she took our order, and we began a long wait before getting our food. When we finally got our food, my son's salad was covered in Caesar dressing instead of the ranch he requested. He does not like Caesar dressing. This wouldn't be so bad, but once again we could not get someone to come to the table so that he could get it fixed. We waited what seemed like forever. My son staring at his food, me eating mine, and both of us with nothing to drink.

Eventually I lost patience and asked one of the many employees just milling about the restaurant if I could see the manager. The woman that I asked was walking up and down the aisle the whole time we were in the restaurant doing nothing but entering information in a tablet. Other employees milling about occasionally stopped and chatted in groups, but no waitress for us. Eventually my son got his new salad and we got our drinks, but we were there a LONG time. I was long done eating but had to watch as my son eat as he was just getting his food.

This restaurant is managed very poorly. I think most of the patrons could step in and do a better job without any experience. At the very least they could figure out that it's a bad idea to have a waitress come from the other side of the restaurant to help two waitresses who have less tables combined than the one who served us from afar."}

The staff is always great and a manager almost always comes around to make sure we are satisfied.  I've tried quite a bit of their menu however I generally go back to the burgers which I think are so tasty.  

I go for the Durango burger since they took their amazing Pablano burger off the menu (complain about that if you go!  bring it back Firebird's).  The potato skins go great as an appetizer.

My other go to is a BLT salad with grilled chicken (get the raspberry chipotle dressing with this and win at life).

Only once did my food come out sub par.  I ordered a rib-eye and it ended up being very tough and unsatisfying.  A manager took care of me with a new steak and a fresh baked potato.  Problem solved!"}

On entering (early evening), we were greeted with a lovely smoky smell that tantalized.  Seating was immediate by a friendly hostess.

The restaurant has a relatively dark interior similar to many other steak houses.  I could hear the music, but it sounded like it was coming from another room.  They could have piped it in to the main room quietly so that it didn't have the distant echoy effect.

My dining companion ordered a strawberry lemonade that was served in a pint glass with a sugared rim.  There were slices of fruit inside and froth on top - evidence of its fresh taste.  I, as usual, ordered coffee and that was much more bitter than I like.  Dark roasts that have been left to heat too long always taste the same, and it isn't good.

Since so many people liked the crab cakes, we ordered those for an appetizer.  To my mind, they had too much of a strong celery taste.  The spicy marmalade sauce that they came with complemented the crab cakes excellently.  The slaw had crispy tortilla strips in it and a nice light dressing - very tasty.

Our ceasar salads arrived.  The usual romaine lettuce was well dressed and augmented by in-house made croutons (the bread also being baked in-house) and nice slices of parmesan cheese.  Unfortunately, the parmesan was the only salt component, so the salad was fairly flat.

I ordered the Durango burger - a chile spiced affair with pepper jack cheese, fried onions and roasted garlic ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, despite the tantalizing smell when we entered the restaurant, there was no smokiness on the burger.  Nor was there any spice.  They grind the meat in-house, so the medium rare burger had a good texture ans taste to it.  However I wanted punch, and got none.

My dining companion ordered the smoke house burger with bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon and grated cheddar cheese.  There was too much bbq sauce included, and the cheddar cheese was not melted.  The bacon was the highlight here.  He also had fries (whereas I opted to replace the fries with my salad).  The portion size on the fries could only be described as small, and the fries were left behind as unappetizing.

Overall, an average place.  It's certainly a place I will go to again, but I'm likely to try other offerings in the area before I choose to go back."}

Probably because I was.  Anyway, I am a huge fan of teppanyaki and have been to several other places around the valley who do it quite well.  I mean how can you not love flaming onion volcanoes, shrimp acrobatics and other food awesomeness?  It's like a circ du solei of food!  Yet I didn't listen to almost everyone I know or 2/3rds of the Yelp reviews saying this place isn't all that wonderful.  Ok, ok - one point Yelp and my friends; zero points Jason.  Benihana isn't in fact all that great.

Benihana is however good at making a teppanyaki place that runs like a well oiled machine or at least a ride at Disney Land.  They shuffle you in, wait until your table is full, put on a little show, charge you way too much then shuffle you out the door to make room for the next group.

Aside from the food being waaaaay overpriced, the service is excellent and meals tasty.  The "show" isn't bad either.  Except now they aren't allowed to do any of the cool stuff because people were apparently getting hurt from flying shrimp and flaming onion volcanoes.  And Benihana being a corporate chain behemoth decided they better do away with the "dangerous" stuff.  Bummer!

In my option the food and service is on par with just about any other teppanyaki place around.  So, if you have a hankering for the stuff you are probably better off going to Ichi Bahn or some other place that may be cheaper, not feel like a Disney ride, and do cooler food tricks n' stuff.  But, if you must go, sign up for Benihana's birthday club thing because they will give you a $30 gift certificate which is pretty solid and the reason why I went."}

I am far to tired to get into it, but OH MY GAWD oddly enough the food has much less "crud" on it, basic steak salt pepper YUMMY, I used to feel guilty saying I need less salt etc... soy on the steak blah, and tonight yippy, but our server was on drugs or just plain and simply put an idiot, I nearly left twice, I  decided to stay had fun, chatting and taking pics. my sushi was made wrong, I ordered first, so it came last and it was wrong, which makes me want to say forget it, but they bring it, and it's wrong again, I say this isn't what I ordered and blonde person claiming to be a server says no they changed the menu, bam she is gone. I ask for paper napkins, bam I never see her, other servers walk by over and over ignoring me and my Voice CARRY"S! I have sushi after the chef arrived, They came with the Birthday  stuff, but for this kid at the table next to us, I had my birthday certificate open on the table the entire time, she says" I asked if anyone was celbrating" OH MY GAWD I then get a 45 dollar bill that says 78  ... she stands there arguing with me, I called Manager , he fixed it, and didn't fight,   I also usually bring cash , but last I was there they put a manditory 18 percent tip. and I was giving the waiter cash, and the chef cash, and then bam i notice the 18 percent gratuity , I can't say give me back the tip, so I tell manager, and he took it off. GRRRR so I figured it was a manditory tip, well it isn't anymore, so I tipped 15.00 cuz I enjoyed the chef, and I suppose someone else will get part of it, but I am exhausted getting bad service, I am not too thrilled the food was good, because what is the point if you have to fight for a napkin, the right food, and of course a lousy candle in some ice cream, (My 11 year old was disappointed on me. ya know) I worked for tips my entire life, and let me tell you, I have been known to tip like mad for great service, imagine if I tipped 15 for this LOUSY SERVICE~ We might be back next year for something, but I won't miss them if I don't go. GRRRRRRRRRR


Training for chefs a must, why not train servers, or is managment to blame cuz  they all look like the worst, ignoring me etc etc I finally got those napkins after begging PLEASE!  well 3 stars makes sense if they own Ra... nuff said, next time I want sushi and service I know where I go for good food and service, and it won't be Ra or Benihana."}

Last night's visit was just as spectacular as the first one.  The food was impeccable, service outstanding, and comfortable just doesn't seem to fit properly to describe the venue.

I had the beef kabobs, medium, which came perfectly grilled and removed from the skewer.  The grilled vegetables had just the right amount of scar on them.  Outstandingly sweet tomato chunks and other fresh vegetables on the second skewer.  The green chile mac and cheese was perfect, just the right amount of heat in an oh so creamy cheese sauce.  My side spinach salad was wonderful, perfect amount of dressing and the right mixture of ingredients.  It will be my main course the next time we are there.

There were six in my party last night and every food item was prepared as good as it gets.  The crab cakes were packed with 80% crab and 20 percent crumb at a minimum. I'm glad to know my second choice of entree would have been divine too.

Finally, Kelly was our server and boy did she shine.  All of us at the table love to banter and get to know our servers.  She held up admirably and made our night that much better. Her kindness and desire to make sure we did not want a thing was exactly what I would want in all of my restaurant visits.  Thank you Kelly for being the outstanding person you are and stay in school to help assure that bright future ahead of you.

Folks, this is a great place to kick back, get a glass of wine, some appetizers and then the full meal deal.  It's cozy, warm, and inviting.

P.S.    It was my birthday and they helped me celebrate by having everyone sign a birthday card and bringing me a candle to make a wish on.  It almost felt like home, really.

WAIT TIME:  We went for our daughter's 18th birthday mid-week.  The greeter knew this was for a special occasion.  We waited over an hour.  We even opted for the cook table for a faster seating, only to be offered to be seated at a tiny side bar with 4 chairs in a row near the prep area which we declined and continued to wait over 45 minutes more.  

STAFF:  The entire staff seems very young and/or inexperienced, not apologetic or accommodating in any way.  I asked to speak to the manager and had to wait 20 minutes to talk to him.  After speaking to him he told me where I could wait- I had been present at the bar enjoying a beer after waiting for over an hour.  Rude.
  
FORGOTTEN ORDER:  The server forgot the order for my husband, so he waited with an empty plate most of the night until we had to say something to the chef.   If you see an empty plate in front of someone you are serving, would the chef or the waitstaff not be attentive enough to ask what that person ordered?  

APPETIZER:  I ordered a dumpling at the bar when I was waiting there.  It was nothing special, we get the same kind at Sam's Club, frozen. 

THE SOUP:  Very skimpy on ingredients.  Only some very thin green onion slices and one slice of mushroom.  Nothing special, tasted of water and soy sauce, that's about it.   The other party at our table asked for additional mushrooms.  Good for them and they were raw, the chef didn't offer to soften them. . 

THE SALAD:  I enjoyed the Asian dressing.  This was okay.  It's kind of hard to mess up salad.

THE CHEF:  Seemed up tight.  He spent most of his time on the fried rice.  We ordered white rice and when ours came, it was colder than cold.   
I ordered scallops, the menu said they were the sea variety which you expect to be large sized.  When they came they were on the small side, more like the bay variety.  No seasonings were put on these scallops and I had to ask the chef to please give me some onions.  He had served the scallops to me without anything else on my plate.   After 2 hours of waiting.  I would prefer to have the entire meal ready at the same time, promptly and correctly.   This was well after 8 p.m. by now. 

UNDERCOOKED:  The zucchini was not well cooked, on the hard side.  He could have taken some time to steam it to soften it better, but all he did was fry it, which does not make for tender zucchini at all.  My husband ate most of this off my plate, as his plate was still empty.  He did not seem very into his cooking at all.  If you have ever tasted undercooked zucchini you know it is on the sour and rubbery side.  Yuck.  When things are prepared with a good attitude and with attention and care, they are a whole lot better in taste.  The chef dropped some of the utensils on the floor towards the end, he was very not into his craft.     

REFILLS:  I could not get a refill of water and after all the salty soy water soup, I could have used it.  The server was not around much to check this for me.  

SUMMARY:  Did I think this was worth it for a bowl of cold rice, rice water, a few tiny seared scallops, with 2 bites of hard zucchini and mostly a plate of caramelized onions?  What a rip off.  I should have stayed home!  The server tried to make up for his oversight with extra bowls of green tea ice cream.  Our daughter loves it, but I didn't care for the taste at all and neither did my husband.  So my daughter made out with 3 bowls; she does enjoy it.    

CLEANLINESS:  The bathroom:  Yuck!  Trash on floor.  Dirty floors.  

I won't be back anytime soon.   Zero stars if I could."}

It is a mid-level steakhouse with typical American fare.  The bar area was very bright (to many bright lights in my opinion) and busy.  

The BLT salad was terrible.  It was like that Costco mixed green salad that the cafeteria served in elementary school.  The salad showed up before the server even sat down my silverware and was completely drenched in salad dressing.  Tip: Ask for all dressing and sauces on the side.  The only thing worse that the salad was the service... One bartender was slinging drinks like a champ, the guy working with her completely left her hanging! Nevertheless, the meal continued :/ 

The worst thing in the world that could ever happen happened ... (Dramatic Pause) I actually had to send food back to the kitchen (glug, knife through my heart) I absolutely pride myself on not sending good back to anyone's kitchen but my medium rare steak came out with hoofs on still breathing, so rare.  The server didn't even attempt to argue, and rushed the plate back to the kitchen.

The refired steak was slightly better than the first but still not really delicious. I want to like this place ... I feel like it has potential.... So one star for the lady bartender and one for hope."}

We went here for my birthday and I had the filet medallions with a wine portobello sauce with a green Chiles mac and cheese...OMG freaking DELISH and worth every damn dime. My boyfriend got the prime rib and swore it was the best he ever had. 

When the manager stopped over we ranted and raved about our server, Michael and how awesome our meal was and she offered us a free dessert.  When my boyfriend told the manger it was my birthday...my dessert came with a candle and the server created a card with highlighter markers and had all the staff sign the card....This place is one of my favorites but tonight showed me they ROCK!

However...that isn't the case. When I arrived I checked in with the front desk girl. I let her know I had a reservation and my name. She asked me if my party was all accounted for and I let her know we were still waiting for a few. Maybe 5 minutes to by and the rest of our group show up. I go back to the same girl and let her know. She looks at me and asks me if I have a reservation...Now during this down time nobody checked in or was sat. It was a Wednesday night at 7:30 and it wasn't very busy. 
After I gave her my name again she let me know my reservation was for 7:45 and we would be sat shortly. So 18 minutes go by, yes I was timing it, and she comes over to me and asks me if I have a reservation and for my name...
At this point I just shake my head and ask her if she is serious. One of the other girls calls my name for the group and we go back. Unfortunately I will not visit again on a Wednesday night because of sheer incompetence that is presented as the first experience a guest receives. I wish I could move past and give a better rating but this girl has zero customer service skills and that makes me sad.

During dinner a few tables were complaining of very slow service and at one point an entire table got up and left and it was a birthday party. Sorry Benihana it just wasn't your night."}

The interior was clean and dark, reminding me of The Keg or a similar steakhouse atmosphere. The staff was very kind, and the customer service excellent. They had some good tunes pumped in as well. We jammed out some Boz Scaggs while dining.

As an appetizer, we had the coconut shrimp. They were cooked well, and were in a bed of unique citrus slaw, which was a hit at the table. The warm bread was also well received. The outside was crusty and the inside soft and buttery. My husband and I had the portabella sandwich; he with fresh fruit and me with tater tots (don't judge me) and a vegetarian black bean soup. The tots were hot and crisp. The fruit was, in fact, fresh, but was your normal fruit cup medley. The sandwich was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of balsamic - not too much to overpower. The rosemary focaccia was great, and absorbed the vinegar for a robust flavor. The vegetarian black bean soup was a bit too spicy for me, but packed tons of flavor. The first time around, I had to send it back because there was a giant unannounced ball of sour cream in the soup. I'm perplexed why one would list it as vegetarian, then drop a glob of animal product in there, which you find by surprise at the bottom of your bowl. I was disappointed in the ignorance of that menu move.

Our companions had the wood-grilled salmon with green beans and the pineapple chicken with garlic mashed potatoes. Both enjoyed their meals. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the beans fresh and al dente. 

Shared dessert was a warm carrot cake with warm caramel syrup. The piece of cake was huge... Definitely to be shared. The cream cheese frosting was utterly sinful. I had a cup of hot tropical green tea. They had a cute little box of Evolution tea. I enjoyed it greatly.

Lastly, I give huge props to our great server Aristotle. He was attentive and accommodating. He didn't split the bill like we asked, but that's not a big deal. My drink was always full, and an empty plate never stayed in the table for long. A replacement soup came fast and with apology, and leftovers promptly boxed and bagged.

For a party of 4, with meals, drinks, appetizers and dessert, the bill was around $150.

We felt thoroughly satisfied by our meal at Firebirds, and will certainly return in the future."}

This is the worst experience I have ever came across with this company. It was terrible from the start and continued on to the finish. 
First, I had a reservation for 7:45 and arrived with my girlfriend at approx 7:30. We were told it would be about 10 minutes (which is acceptable as we were early for our reservation), but ended up not being sat until 8:15. I had approached the host stand numerous times asking the progress for when it would be our turn. Every response was "You are the next table! We are just setting it up". Meanwhile, I would watch a couple more tables be sat... without me. The fact that I was forced to have a late dinner, along with being pulled along to stay was very rude and unnecessary. 
Next, my server, Tania, was absolute garbage for many reasons. To start, I had to BEG for her to come around and fill my empty water glass that eventually had no ice due to her lack of urgency. As she was taking the order, she asked if I wanted the fried rice which was cooked by the chef or something else. I stated I wanted brown rice when everyone got their fried entree. Not only did I not receive my rice until 80% of the way through my entire meal (30 minutes after fried rice was served), but when I asked for soy sauce she did not supply me with some until several minutes later. In fact, she came by the table to clear plates in the meantime and I had to AGAIN remind her for my needs. It was actually humorous as to how bad her service was, considering it was a relatively slow night for the restaurant. Yes she was nice, but man was she inconsiderate at my needs as a customer. 
Moving on, I get the check, which I also gave her my coupon for coming in on my birthday. She redid the total balance and gave me my revised check. The total was correct than and I, being a prior employee for 3 years in the restaurant industry, tipped her over 20% on the amount before any discounts applied knowing this is her form of income. I left and was happy to be out of there and finally have food in my stomach. 
Now the nightmare begins. As my total (before tip) was roughly $33ish dollars, and after tip just under $50, I get an email from Chase, my banking provider, stating I was charged well over $130. By the time I got home and noticed the screw up the store was closed and I figured I would call in the morning to have it resolved. 
In my hunt to get my bill adjusted properly, I had talked to some female manager on duty who was far from friendly. She told me that what I was charged was correct and that I am "crazy" for claiming I was charged over $130. She was beyond rude, arrogant, and overall left a terrible taste in my mouth to ever come back. I than had no other choice to call my bank who is now disputing my charge as Benihana could care less about the mistake that took part on their employees account. I am currently still getting it resolved, out of the additional funds they made a mistake on, and had no urge for reimbursement from them. All I want is to be charged the total I came in and dined in for but I guess in the world of Benihana, and the female manager in particular that is too much to ask. 

I will never go back to this location as they are unkind, disrespectful, careless, and beyond rude. 

On a final note, do not order shrimp from this location. My girlfriend and I were very uncomfortable with eating their dish as it was uncleaned shrimp and contained the black string of you know what in their contents. Very gross, but honestly after my experience with them yesterday and now today, I am not surprised. 

Overall stay away from Chandler Benihana, you will do yourself a favor. Terrible store, ran by terrible "leaders"."}

Yes, we still give 5 stars.  Today is my third or fourth visit.  My first visit was April 2010 on my anniversary.

I had the Aspen Sirloin, and it was very good.  Light seasoning, but just enough for a nice flavor.  Meat was juicy even though I like mine medium-well (very little pink).  Sometimes places when they try to achieve 'medium-well' will dry the steak out.  Firebirds got it just right!

The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also very nice.  Good flavor without being overpowering (Parmesan can be pretty strong).

And the bread service was great.  It comes out fresh and hot!  I love fresh bread still warm from the oven!  I do wish they had a wheat loaf like Black Angus, though.  But it was wonderful.

They offer numerous dishes here, not just steaks.  You can get salmon, chicken, pasta, even burgers and sandwiches.  So far I've tried the Aspen Sirloin, and the au poive steak (I've had that twice...it's totally awesome!).

Their fresh lemonade was perfect!  It's not the swill from the fountain.  This is real, fresh lemonade.  Truly wonderful.

A bit pricey, but I highly recommend this place if you want good American cuisine.  Nothing fancy, but what they do is done extremely well.  Simple flavors to accentuate the entree, not cover it up.  I'm not sure any of the high-end fancy places could do any better.  Probably not as good, in many instances."}

This restaurant was excellent in my opinion.  The bathrooms were as clean as the rest of the restaurant.  Our service and food were excellent, I don't really like Southeast Asian food but this was amazing.  Having it prepared right in front of us was definitely a treat.  The price was very reasonable as well, we have gotten away from other lesser quality restaurants with a bigger bill.  I ordered the Chicken Yakisoba, which was the most familiar thing for me on the menu, and was great.  The chef made us little 'appetizers' as we watched so we would not get hungry while waiting.  

The manager kept around us making sure we had the best experience we could.  For that I thank him, my family and I really enjoyed Benihana.

I have never had a bad meal here.  The place has a great wood smoked smell inside and it's a bit dark inside, which I kind of like and provides a nice atmosphere.  They have an open kitchen so you know your food hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 min.  During the winter, the bar inside is great, as it has a huge fireplace and an inviting atmosphere to partake in some cocktails.  The outdoor patio also has a fireplace and a great place to sit when it's not too hot.  

So what should you order there?  Here are my favorites, depending on your mood:

The filet wrapped in bacon is a delicious staple at Firebirds.  The meat is tender and always cooked perfectly (I like mine medium rare +).

Wood grilled salmon - some of the best salmon I have had!  LOVE the flavor of the wood.

Ahi tuna appetizer - if you're going light and like ahi, I highly recommend this from the starter menu.  The mustard sauce they serve with it has a mighty big kick and is one of my favorites.  I've tried to recreate it at home, without success. 

Green beans as a side option - ohhhh I know what you are thinking!!  Green beans? Yuck.  I'll get something else.  Well, everything is good but the green beans are the BEST!  They are sauteed with pecans and a little butter and they are soooo delicious.  You won't know it's a veggie!! 

As far as a chain restaurant goes, this is a top pick for me.  Check it out!!  You can't go wrong."}

The only problem was that the chef messed up my order but he immediately apologized and served me my right order and HEY I got to keep the wrong order (free food!). 

I'll totally be coming back and recommending this place."}

It was my birthday. The husband and I made reservations for 530 online. We checked in and sat down in front of the podium. I kid you not, at 610pm, after watching others with later reservations being seated, we had to remind the girl we had been waiting 40 minutes and had checked in at 530. We got a fast apology and were told that "so and so" was new and we would be seated next.
620 we were seated with 6 others that we did not know. 
Okay, fine, lets order up and get this going...

Our soup came. Barely lukewarm. The lady next to us fed hers to the baby and I drank it down like water, no spoon needed.

Our chef came over and went down the orders with everyone. Its now close to 7pm and I am starving. We ended up eating things randomly as they came: a bowl of fried rice. Then a few shrimp. Then a slice of zucchini. My four scallops. The onions and mushrooms kept cooking on the grill and I wound up eating bites of plain steak because I did not want them to get cold in the interim. 

I watched the others play pass the baby down the line because our chef barely spoke with us. I had more fun watching the table next to us being served.  

Its after 8pm at this point. I am waiting for our check and asking for the dessert to go because I don't think I can sit here any longer. $80 with tip and I even used a birthday coupon. 

There's a lot of "maybe's" here: maybe the chef was new. Maybe the girl up front was new. Maybe three hours to eat a meal is a long time.  Maybe I should have asked for a no kid table since I left my THREE kids home so I could enjoy my dinner. I am disappointed. MAYBE they can do better if I decide to come back. Maybe..."}

 Thinking we'd be called next.  After 40 minutes we checked back in and were told that we have only waited 40 of the 90 minutes. They had six open tables and only the walk ins waiting. 

I would understand this type of reservation based seating at a high end place in Scottsdale but in chandler, come on! I called the manager and complained but he stated that they need to plan an hour and a half ahead and that's why they keep the tables empty. I guess I didn't understand the Benihana seating plan. 

my advice is to make reservations and only show up with reservations, otherwise you'll leave pretty pissed just like me. We will never come back to the Benihana in chandler, Scottsdale is where it's at! They understand how to seat people."}

The restaurant is about 60% full. Not very bustling for the "most romantic night of the year". First time here and I like the interior. It's like a nice upscale cabin. Very classy lumberjack.

My daughters ordered off the kids' menu (chicken strips and hamburger). Their meals look excellent for being kids' meals. They both got two sides (fresh veggies and fresh fruit, but could've chosen fries, green beans, Mac & cheese, or parmesean mashed potatoes). The burger looks good quality and chicken strips came with honey mustard and were delicious. Yes, I tried them. It was came with a small two cookie pack of Oreos.

I ordered a medium rare aged 14oz ribeye with a loaded baked potato. The loaded potato looked exactly like the one at Texas Roadhouse. I'm not opposed to that, but for $6 less, I could've gotten a bigger ribeye and the same potato. The ribeye was overcooked, on the latter end of the medium well side. Almost well done. Very little pink. Decent seasoning, but dry and chewy.

The service was very lacking. Our waitress was so hard to get ahold of that the burger went ketchup-less and my iced tea went sugar-free for about half of our meal. BUT, she was nice and apologetic and at least seemed genuine about it. Not sure why we were ignored though. 2.76489 stars but I'll round up to 3"}

Normally i would give 4 stars because of the hassle but being its steak it can happen and the manager always gets involved and makes sure we are taken care of. No hassle at all and redeems the evening for us. I never get his name but he has orangish red hair very pleasant guy.  Even the servers are kind and on point.

She then states "it's going to be an hour or so" as though she didn't have time for us and wanted us to leave, which she accomplished. My husband did get a hold of the manager over the phone to complain about the hostess. The manager promised a return phone call by 5pm on Thursday but never called.

Another poster says that Firebirds is her favorite chain restaurant. I have to agree, largely because it never felt like a chain restaurant. The servers are friendly and attentive, the food is always good, and the ambience is pleasant - quiet enough to have a conversation without feeling like you are eating in a library.

For lunch, the Seared Ahi Tuna is melt-in-your-mouth good. The Firebirds BLT Salad is way too sinful to be called "salad," but I will call it "delicious." And the Durango Burger is to die for. It is piled too high for the average person to eat without a knife and fork, but I unhinged my jaw and took it down. Yum!

At dinnertime, I definitely enjoyed the Double Black Diamond Martini. Possibly a little too sweet, but really good just the same. You can't go wrong with the Sesame Encrusted Salmon. It was tender and juicy.

*Sigh* Now I am hungry. Time to plan an AZ visit and a stop at Firebirds!"}

Called ahead to put us on the waiting list and informed it would be 50 mins wait. Arrived 30 mins after making a phone call, still told another 30 mins. Since a patio table was available right away, decided to take a patio table, I thought it was nice.

Service.... I think other server beside our assigned server was more helpful than her. She would often forget things, my glass of coke stayed empty for a while, just seemed overwhelmed and tend to not care about us on the patio. Other servers were nice.

Food.... I had blue cheese filet with loaded baked potato. Since they coated potato with so much salt, every time potato shifts on my plate, excess salt will get on steak, making my food overly salty. filet mignon was okay, had better cut. Blue cheese was nice, unfortunately it just got too salty from baked potato, I just couldn't eat anymore. Complimentary bread was actually very tasty. 

Nice ambiance, located near the Chandler mall, perhaps I visited during their off day, but based on my first visit, this place will not be my first choice of restaurant to eat again as there are so many options nearby."}

If you are looking for good teppanyaki japanese cooking, this is a very good place for it. I have tried many things here but you know what they don't get enough credit for? Their sushi! The Vegas roll at Benihana is the best vegas roll I have ever had and might actually be my favorite sushi roll ever! Now, onto their regular food, I have tried many menu items and all have been good. That includes: teriyaki steak, hibachi chicken, hibachi shrimp, spicy hibachi chicken, and colossal mango shrimp. However, the best dishes I ordered here in addition to their Vegas Roll are the yakisoba and the hibachi scallops. These are both delicious and some of the better values on the menu I felt. The fried rice is 1.25 more to add on and although tasty, I don't feel that its worth it to pay extra. It is fun to watch them make it though. Here's the weird thing: my favorite part of the meal (next to the Vegas roll) is their vegi's. The zucchini and onions taste sooo good with all the butter in them!!! Of course, everything is better with butter! Another good thing about the meals is you get soup and salad so you feel like the price is a little more reasonable. The soup is very brothy but has a great onion flavor to it. The salad on the other hand has a ginger dressing that I am not a fan of. All in all, benihana, although a little overpriced, has some terrific food and its a great place to take a date. The show the chefs put on it very fun, however, it doesnt change much from chef to chef if you have been more than once. Oh one other understated item: their tempura banana's for dessert. Delectable! Everyone should try Benihana and their dam Vegas Roll at least once in their lives. A final tip: If you expect great service, do not sit in the bar to have dinner. We made the mistake of doing that once and had to wait forever for everything! Sit at the tables if you are planning to have more than drinks. WORD!"}

The hostess was not friendly, we waited a while to be seated, even with a reservation. The server was a little more friendly and became gradually more attentive (I think because she realized everyone at our table was getting frustrated), but never really hit the service mark. It took an unreasonable amount of time for the drink orders, and for courses to begin coming. 

Then the chef. God bless him. He was new, not Asian, exhausted, and really slow. He kept misreading the ticket, kept serving food we'd ordered to the strangers at the table with us, he missed about every little "trick" he tried, and he was clearly nervous (and apparently gets chatty when he's nervous). He was sweating over our food profusely.... until the server came over and turned the vent on 3/4 of the way through the little show. The meal was served so slowly that it was cold and you couldn't enjoy your food. Portions were small and the flavor was bland... I had the hibachi chicken and it was overcooked.... the veggies were burned on bottom and zucchini was slimy on top.... There was so much to be appalled at that when the lady came and asked how our meal was, we just said "fine" so we could leave quicker and never return.  I'm pretty sure if we'd complained we'd have just gotten another card for corporate...

The other family even pointed out that there were two kids with birthdays at the table. That was a bummer - so much for going to Benihana for special occasions. 

Also, the carpet is very dirty which makes you feel that other things may be neglected. That being said when you are sitting at the cooktop and the chef is doing a good job obeying all the food-handling regulations you worry less. 

I ordered Seafood Diablo and several of the ingredients listed on the menu were missing. I asked for this spicy dish extra-spicy. My dish was cooked last (no big deal) but then when it was served and others were finishing, our waiter started working another table and I couldn't get a drink to save my life.  

Also, I know the chefs have to learn but our chef was noticeably less skilled compared to the other chefs on shift this evening. That's just bad luck of the draw, but seemed to be the way this night was going. All in all, it was a very bad experience."}

It was packed when we arrived but not overwhelming. The place was decorated so nicely for New Years with balloons everywhere. I started off with the Mirassou Pinot Noir wine. This was delicious and extremely smooth. For our entree, I ordered the Filet Mignon, medium. When they first brought it out and I tried it, it didn't taste medium at all. It was actually more well. Our waiter took my plate back so they can re do my order. A few minutes later the manager came over to apologize for the inconvenience. When they brought out my new order again, the manager was there to make sure it was exactly what I wanted. 

Even for a medium, I felt like the Filet was a bit dry. However, they have spectacular customer service. I would definitely come back."}

We come here for most of our birthdays and sadly this one was not enjoyable.  Even the guests we invited to dinner mentioned the service was subpar.  

Thankfully, the chef was very fun and saved the evening from 1star.  We tipped him directly to insure he was not subjected to her poor service.

We went for my sisters birthday and we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. When we arrive 15 minutes before our reservation time we checked in but was not seated until 20 minutes after our original reservation time with no explanation... Others were sat first and I was confused as I'm sure they didn't have a reservation at the same time as us. To blow off some stress and kill time while we waited I decided I would go to the bar while we waited. The bartender told the only 3 empty seats were taken for some regulars who will be on there way shobeing reserved for some one coming shortly... I thought that was odd but I said forget it and  just got my scotch and went to our table because it was finally "Ready". When we sat no one acknowledged us for 15 minutes and I tried to get everyone's attention but no one even looked our direction. When a waiter finally did come we asked to speak with the manager who immediately made it seem like we were being impatient but said I'll switch your server anyway. I was heated at this point so I walked out and have no intention of going back.

The only reason I think it has to do with our race is because my sisters and I were the only black People there, and it just didn't feel right. No one else was sat 20 minutes after their reserved time, no one else was told you're not allowed to sit at the bar, and no one else when we tried to address the issues get ignored and spoken to like your opinion is not validated"}

Service was slow but our server was very nice- our chef was really disappointing to be completely honest. You could barely understand him- he really wasn't a showman at all and couldn't cook the food well! The scallops were torched, meats were overcooked. The best thing I ate that night was the Rainbow Roll- which was very fresh! The white peach saki sangria was also tasty! We decided to leave before dessert (take it to go) because I ended up not feeling well half way through the night.

It is, by far, the most pretentious restaurant I've eaten at. Every single employee from the hostess, to the server, to the chef, to the manager, asked us if we celebrating a special occasion. Why didn't they just say we're so over priced, no one would eat here unless it's their anniversary or birthday. 

There are so many other teppanyaki restaurants around the valley that are just as good, if not better. I would probably go to one of them (many of which are not chains) before heading back to Benihana."}

First time was pretty upsetting. We had to wait ~45 minutes for a dinner table, at which point they sat us in the bar area. The waitress was rarely to be seen and served me won-ton soup in a chipped bowl (serious health code violation - took a picture). Half-way through our meal, they sat some people with us at our small table which made it somewhat awkward.

Second time was much better. We made reservations and got seated at the Hibachi table. Chef was quite exciting and entertaining, keeping everyone involved. Had some good cold Sake with apple flavor, the rest of the food was pretty standard.

Be sure to sign up for their birthday promotion ($30 off one person's meal), but keep in mind that it is for one person only (they are pretty serious about that)!"}

i forgot what my kiddo ordered but i will say he barely touched it.
best part about this trip was when we were leaving i was able to feed the left over prime rib to a stray cat sitting outside (yes..i took the leftovers to go...i hate complaining to the staff).

That new place because a favorite of mine in Chandler.  I would go as to say this is probably the best steak Ive had in town.  

When you first pull int the parking lot, you can smell the grill from a mile away.  Just an incredible smell.  Thinking about it right now makes me want to jump into my car and head over there.

The staff is very nice there and of course like all fine dining places, everyone there looks like they stepped off of GQ and Vogue Magazines. The place has a nice steakhouse feel to it.  Wood all over, deer head mounted on all, and you can see the cooks making your food right in the back.  Always nice to see what's going on with the food.  

The things I love most about this place is their bread.  Fresh sour dough loaves that come out piping hot with butter.  I call it "Butt Bread;" for those who have been here, you know why.  Best bread Ive had at a restaurant.

Another great addition is their BLT salad.  They have this great garlic ranch dressing that I have not seen anywhere else.  That with bacon bits, lettuce and tomato... delicious.

My personal favorite is their rib-eye and their dipped in, loaded baked potato.  I get the same thing every time now.  Yes I have tried other things and they were amazing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.

My parents went with my girlfriend and I once and my dad ate 3 loaves of the bread himself.  Yeah... good stuff."}

Last night 6 of us dined there for 3 Birthday Celebrations and shared a table with a couple who was also celebrating a Birthday. We had a 715pm reservation, got seated on time, got a Chef at 845pm. Our waiter came at 830pm n said that his Manager is giving free appetizers for the wait, this is after we had our Soup n Salad. Around this time we let the server know that two guests found hair in their soup, he said the Manager will be over to discuss. The Manager never came so my friend flagged him down to inform him n he disregarded her complaint and walked off. We found out that this was the District Manager.  He never comes back as requested. Our Chef comes rushing us through the service because he says there's only 5 Chefs for the whole restaurant and he's being yelled at in the back to quickly finish our meal. Burned food, not enough rice prepared, waiter was overwhelmed and I blame Management. Instead of seating more tables they should have delayed others reservations or turned people away. Three out of six of us was first n last time guests. We got 15% off the bill but that's not sufficient at all. The Chefs portion of the meal is the main attraction n Benihana Chandler failed last night."}

An online banker buddy from San Diego was in town for training, so I decided to meet her for dinner. This restaurant was across the street from her hotel and sounded really interesting. Turns out, I was right.

Since neither of us are big eaters, we decided to split and entree and add a side. We were both eying the blue cheese filet medium rare (great minds think alike!) Sara mentioned that sprinkling some of the blue cheese over sweet potato waffle fries is terrific; I thought the addition of green beans would help balance the meal. They actually brought out our meal on two plates (perhaps this is common now, but I remember having to portion split meals myself). The filet was perfect. Perfect!! The blue cheese slightly melted into the meat, crispy bacon tucked around it all. Adding a bit of the cheese to the fries were phenomenal (seriously, you have to give this a try). The green beans with candied pecan pieces added a nice fresh crunch to the dinner.

As much as I *hate* to drive long distances, I really would consider returning here just to have what I'm certain would be another terrific meal. Thanks, Western Union, for picking up the majority of the bill."}

My fiancé and I have been about 10 times and have never once had a bad experience. We both have worked in the customer service industry for a long time and honestly I think other businesses should model after Firebirds.  The food is amazing. I usually get the peppercorn steak which is the best I've ever had and he gets the burger. The cheesecake is the best!!! I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. You can tell the staff truly enjoys their job and everyone helps each other out like family. I would recommend this place to anyone. 

I have to say one last thing. I celebrated my birthday/engagement party there the staff made a design of a ring on my plate and said congrats, and several of the staff came by and congratulated me. How thoughtful! We will be long time customers for sure! Thank you for being a great business."}

The remaining 3 people arrived at 4:48 pm. By 5:15 - 5:20 we were still waiting to be seated. We were here for a birthday celebration and I was extremely surprised that with more than 1/2 of our party and time to spare that they wouldn't seat us. We had a few small kids, a baby in a carrier, an 89 year old woman and they made us wait long afterward to be seated. 

This was my first visit to Benihana and I wasn't completely impressed with the start of our visit. However, by the time we were seated things eased up a little bit. Although, interesting that no one made any mention of the hold up or the reasoning for the hold up since our table was open that entire time. Our chef was awesome! I wish I could recall his name because I actually saw him mentioned on here and was super excited when he was assigned to our table. 

He did a stupendous job of impressing the kids and was very enjoyable to watch. I had the Yakisoba, the salad and the miso soup. Yes. it was amazingly good. I had bites of everyone's dish and they were all good. Really really good. I couldn't finish my entire dish so I ended up taking it home and upon reheating it, it was still very very good. 

I wasn't responsible for paying the tab but from what I hear it really is expensive. So, as long as someone else is covering dinner I am totally in. HA! Seriously though, it's worth the experience even if it isn't a regular occurrence."}

Having your food cooked right in front you along with a little chef artistry entertainment, makes this meal a little more special.  The meal is hand-crafted and fresh, adding a nice touch.

I had Scallops, Calamari, and Shrimp.  Dad did as well.  We enjoyed it.  Mom went with the Filet Mignon and I was allowed a bite and mmm, mmm - delicious and tender, melted in my mouth.

I now want to go to the one in San Francisco, as every time I try to go to it there, it is always busy.

Great Service
Nice Staff
Good Food
Nice Ambiance

Your own food, cooked right there where you see it being crafted, then dished out to your bowl was superb."}

We dined midday between the lunch and dinner crowds and enjoyed a quiet meal in a fairly empty venue. It smells delicious inside! I wonder if they pipe in that smoky smell or if it's truly wafting from that kitchen? The interior is well appointed, clean, and shows pride in this franchise. I ordered the Surf & Turf (which I was CRAVING) with the BLT salad, and stole more than my fair share of crisp, mouthwatering tater tots from my husband's plate. The filet was prepared a perfect medium rare and melted in my mouth. It's bacon-wrapped with light seasoning that doesn't distract from the natural flavor of the cut. The lobster tail is substantial in size - more than expected - tender, not overly seasoned, and had a slightly smoked flavor. Our young server Lulu was attentive, offered helpful suggestions, and was quite patient & accommodating as we made a multitude of substitutions when we ordered due to dietary considerations. Our glasses were never empty and every request was met with gracious politeness. Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu which offers a variety of selections without becoming overwhelming. The GM stopped by our table to chat - which is always a nice touch. We will definitely come back next time I crave Surf & Turf. It was well priced at around $40 and worth every penny."}

Went with my mom prior to a concert this week and Son, I was not disappoint. Service from waitstaff was prompt, professional and never "hovering". Mom had the peppercorn sirloin with the au poive sauce and raved about it. I had the center-cut sirloin, medium rare and it was outstanding. I almost did a double take on the thickness; it was approaching filet thickness and grilled to perfection. Spiced pecan green beans ($6) as an added side was worth every penny.

I'll definitely be back. If mom is a party to where to eat in the future, I think she will persuade others that Firebirds is a legitimate candidate for steak."}

Very nice to see that your food is cooked fresh in front of you, but it's too bad they use the same oils and sauces to cook everything in, makes it a bit bland, but not horrible. Fried rice is the best! Sushi, not so much.

Been here a couple times and secretly wish they could do maybe a slightly different version of entertainment... possibly? Don't wanna sound mean, but I know everything that they're gonna do already. Not saying that I can do any better, but it would be nice to see a new trick once in a while. Slightly pricey, but hey, it's live entertainment & meal all in one."}

Anymore it has became really hit or miss. This is my first 3 star review and I feel guilty for it but I have to just be honest. Last I was there the service in the sushi lounge was poor, the entree I ordered in the sushi lounge was nothing like what you would get at a hibachi grill. The chicken was rubbery and tough and had some spicy sauce lazily drizzled on top it wasn't even cooked in it. The sauces have diminished over the years to being bitter runny goo and the dressing isn't much better. Wish they would get their act together and return to their former glory. I have forgiven them time and time again, even when one meal I had sand in my salad but I'm kind of saddened that I won't be returning until something changes. Also worth mentioning my friend was there a week ago and there was a large cockroach crawling on the floor inside the dining room."}

They were full and she said they could seat us by 7:15 so we moved it up 15 minutes.  The hostess also asked me if we were celebrating anything this evening and I told her 39 years of marriage!  She said wonderful and would alert our server!  She also stated we will try to make your evening memorable!  Great we are off to a good start!

We arrived at 7:10 and checked in.  There were people waiting everywhere, outdoors, on the patio, in the rocks out front, in the bar, waiting room, etc. We were promptly told that they were running 10 to 15 minutes behind schedule.  No biggie as things happen.  30 minutes later we checked with the hostess and we were informed that there were still 3 parties in front of us.  15 minutes later we were seated (7:55 p.m.) a full 40 minutes after our reservation.  How nice it would have been to have the hostess tell us "thank you for waiting or thank you for your patience".  Nothing, just "this way please".  We waited for another 10 minutes for a cocktail waitress to visit our table.  It was now 8:05 and we were very hungry so we asked the women to send our waitress to our table with menus.   When our waitress arrived, she was laughing and stated that she had had quite a night with a "prime rib disaster" they had experienced.  My poor husband just looked at me as that was what he was looking forward to ordering.  Again, she never said "thank you so much for waiting", or attempted to explain what she meant  or give any details to the prime rib disaster she mentioned.  We received our menus and another 10 minutes passed.  We flagged down the cocktail waitress and asked to send her to send our waitress to our table.  She came by and took our order.  We promptly received our delicious bread and for the next 25 minutes we completely consumed it.  Finally about 8:55 our food arrived.  By now we are just trying to make a bad evening good.  

We were very pleasantly surprised by our food (the only good spot in the evening and the reason for the 3 stars)  I ordered a filet mignon, which was probably the best filet I have had in 2 decades!  The baked potato was also a delight.  My husband did not have enough faith in the restaurant to order the prime rib so he ordered a steak and garlic mashed potatoes.  Also cooked to perfection.   The wine I ordered had tasted as if it had been sitting around for a while.  

When our waitress brought the dessert menu, my husband asked if they had anything special.  Our waitress asked why and he explained that it was our 39th.  She acted like it was the first she heard about it.  She said she would ask and see what she could do.   Of course by now you could probably write the script.  She took another 10-15 minutes to get back to our table and asked if we were ready to order.  Clearly she had forgotten our last conversation.  By now my husband finally said how disappointed he was in our experience.  She listened patiently and said she would send over the manager to talk to us.  Yep, you guessed it another 10 minutes and nothing.  5 minutes later she brought our check and said the manager discounted our order.  

It is so sad to see a fine restaurant so poorly managed.  The hostesses need to be better trained as well as the wait staff.  We sat there and thought of several ideas for them.  When we were seated, they could have said they were offering discounts on wine and beer or something.  Anything just throw us a bone!   Honestly it would have been wonderful to get the manager's side of the story.  The food though was excellent.  We left at 9:55, over 2.5 hours after our arrival.  Not sure if the food is worth the mismanagement."}

He didn't have enough shrimp and vegetable appetizers for the whole table. My husband didn't get vegetables because he ran out. The guy made it seem like a huge inconvenience to get more since he already made it for everyone else so my husband didn't get any even though I asked him to please get more since we are paying for it. The guy could not keep track of who ordered what and was putting the wrong food in the wrong plates and just kept making jokes about it. He was also making a bunch of racist jokes and comments. He also let us know he was just fired from his last job a few weeks ago. Once everything was done it was past 1030 and we were just trying to leave and we asked for the bill and no desert since we were there so long and the waitress took 15min just to bring our checks back.

While the filet was delightful (shockingly so), and the yellowtail sashimi sufficient for our expectations, the Las Vegas roll was severely lacking, and the rest of the meal was served after apparently sitting around for a while.

He had dined there before, but I had never tried out the establishment.  I made our reservation for 5:15, but when we arrived we were informed that they were running about 15-20 minutes behind. No biggie to us, we just bellied up to the bar and enjoyed some happy hour priced bevs (a peach sangria number and a patron margarita -which wasn't a happy hour item).  Once our table was ready, we were seated with a family of 6 at a spot near the entrance. 

There were quite a few options for food and we both ended up getting the filet (mine with steamed rice and his with a double order of the chicken fried rice). The server was nice and was careful to take down everyone's order correctly.  All of our meals came with onion soup to start and then a small salad with a ginger vinaigrette, followed by a shrimp appetizer. We were having a gay ole time and then our chef, Stephen, came out.  He was good at keeping us all entertained, cooking the food at a perfect pace and made our steaks gloriously medium rare!  I loved the entire meal (and so did my boo).

Not even close. Benihana might have been hip about the time Godzilla and Bruce Lee were in their prime. A time when Japanese cuisine might have come across as exotic to most Americans so all the mystical kung fu clown aspects of the Teppanyaki restaurant food preparation process were quite the spectacle and even a reason to come to a Benihana in the first place. Nowadays nobody other than some hermit from Appalachia would find this exotic. It is, unfortunately, old hat. So when a rep from a vendor that is currently figuratively bending us over and letting us have it like we were the proverbial large minority inmate's new bitch - decided to treat us to a lunch at Benihana it almost felt like a slight. Like hey you little short bus riders - you may find this spectacle awe-inspiring and a great lunch. Either that or maybe he really didn't know any better and finds the whole thing fascinating and awesome himself like he fell out of a short bus himself. So anyway we all show up at Benihana except for our department's resident tard (you know the type - there's at least one in every group) who we had to wait for because they would not start until ALL guests arrive. They wouldn't even SEAT us until he did. Pssht. Once he finally got there we were taken to our table where we pretty much were able to order immediately. Once all our orders were taken this guy comes over to our table and begins the show. He mumbled something in what was probably Japanese really quickly as he started and began his chopsocky cutlery show. His whole schtick was adding a sauce or spice and each time he added something he would pretend it was something else when he announced what he was doing - chocolate instead of soy sauce or gasoline instead of sake and so on. He chopped all of our vegetables up and he chopped all of our vegetables down. It was an ancient Japanese art and everybody knew their part. Everybody was... quite entertained. Food? Definitely had better. Benihana is for kids, you silly rabbit! After we were done eating it felt like the staff wanted us not to linger and GTFO so they could prepare for the next wave. Probably won't be back unless some other vendor decides to treat us like their bitch and bring us here for lunch. Plenty of parking as it shares a lot with other restaurants in the restaurant row on the south side of Chandler Blvd (just north of Chandler Fashion Center)."}

I called and even spoke to a manager to make a reservation for a large party of about 20 . made the reservation a while before the event . when I made it nothing else was asked of me other then my name and amount and time I had asked about their prime rib since I had read it was good and this was my whole reason for chosing this place they raved about it and mentioned nothing else. The day of the event I was approached by a different manager as we waited for our seat . he asked some small talk type of questions but then asked something that had me a bit confused, he asked if we had done or requested a particular menu. This had me worried and I knew something was gonna be up since no onenhad mentioned that to me. We got sat down and most of it was lovely the bread was good . they had two waitresses that took care of us that did a good job . but no one mentioned anything about menu items. Our reservation was a bit later but still several hours before they close. When it came time to order meals I ordered the prime rib I had been waiting for . only to find out they had ran out . at least 5 others in my party were also trying to order the prime rib and this was very upsetting that even when I was making a reservation and specifically asking about the prime rib did no one mention to me it was limited per day and would be out long before we arrived . or that there was an option to request a specific menu so maybe they could hold some for us ? Not sure how that would have worked cud no one explained it to me . but this experience which other wise should have been fine was ruined by this. The steak I did have was alright . not amazing but not what I had been craving for a month. The service its self was good for the large party we had the wait staff took care of us well. You do wait a little longer for things but its to be expected for a place like this. Just kinda put a bad taste I'm my mouth and could have been handled much better."}

We opted for seating in the lovely patio, since the weather was so wonderful,  some good conversation, and people watching. For me, a signature martini,  double black diamond which consists of fresh pineapple and citrus vodka. Served with a wedge of sweet, sliced pineapple. Since this is happy hour, they are half off, which equates to  $5.00. During their non- happy hour times, they can be a bit spendy. 
I had only planned on Happy hour drinks, but I thought about it and it is Friday and it's been a long week, and the salmon on the menu was calling my name.  I went with the grilled smoked salmon and the presentation was nice, the fish was cooked just right, and comes with a baked potato and a veggie.  Mr H just went with a salad, but he did confess that he really enjoyed my salmon I ordered.  
The server was friendly enough, and I enjoyed the food. If you come only for happy hour, they also have half priced apps, which is your typical sliders, wings, queso and chips. Half off on their martini's and I believe some of their beer is on the HH list.  Happy Hours: monday-friday and ends at 7pm.  Can you believe it? this is my 100th review."}

Each time I have gone, the food and service has been great. Their bread is probably one of the best bread loaves I have ever had and I can make a meal out of that and that alone. Freshly baked and slightly doughy still, its magnificent. When I first started going to Firebirds, I would order the pork tenderloin with a sweet and sour glaze and the southwest au gratin potatoes. Sooooo good. Now its no longer on the menu   :(   Anyways, I have found a replacement in the grilled salmon with veggies and Parmesan mashed potatoes.I always ask for peach salsa on the side too to put on the fish. It is honestly one of the best salmon meals I have ever had at any restaurant and surprisingly, one of the healthiest items at Firebirds. I love that they list their nutrition facts on their website. Anyways, my husband loves the prime rib and loaded baked potato. He says that the prime rib is consistently good and flavored really well. Also, Firebirds has some awesome wings for appetizers and their tortilla slaw with coconut shrimp appetizer is to die for. The slaw is so different but very tasty. Oh and for dessert, their key lime pie and brownie sundae are pretty legit. There are only a couple of things that I have tried that I was not overly impressed with: Tortilla soup (creamier than I like and not much flavor), pecan crusted trout was kinda dry. 
The service at Firebirds has always been great. There was one time when my salmon was raw in the middle. The waitress took it away and continuously apologized. A manager came over and offered to give me any appetizer and as much bread as I wanted at no charge while I waited for my meal to be recooked. They also gave me dessert on the house. The managers as well as their staff genuinely care about the customers it seems which is something I haven't seen in a long time at other restaurants. Their prices are also decent. I personally thought the prices, service, and quality of food at Firebirds far surpassed The Keg.
My husband and I will definitely continue to come to this restaurant over places like the Keg and more upscale steakhouses!"}

I loved my first visit so much, I took my Mom and her husband for dinner there a few days later!  His fave meal there is the buffalo meatloaf w/ sautéed mushroom gravy w/ sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and spiced pecan green beans.  LOVE the spiced pecan green beans!!  My Mom and I adore the seafood entrees served here; she especially loves the tempura-battered shrimp w/ tortilla slaw, FANTASTIC mango habañero chutney and huge steak fries.  I regularly order the pecan crusted trout, w/c comes w/ cilantro peach salsa and tortilla slaw.  While the peach salsa is so tasty and the slaw delicious and marvelously crunchy, my  allergies prevent me from enjoying them, so I always ask for substitutions of mango habanero chutney and spiced pecan green beans, the latter being so sinfully good!!  [According to the restaurant's online nutrtitional guide, It's also calorific AND loaded w/ saturated fat, but hey, I don't smoke tobacco or "creative" cigs, nor do drugs, and I rarely drink (yeah, what fun am I to have around, eh?), so I allow myself occasional splurges w/ certain foods!  So you see, my allergies are blessings of sorts...]

In the appetizers menu, the lobster spinach queso, coconut shrimp, chicken quesadilla, CRABCAKES, and chicken tortilla soup are all scrumptious!  (Yes, I enjoyed many of these items before I learned that the awful cramps and other seemingly crazy and non-sequential symptoms I'd experience afterwards were caused by food allergies!)

Desserts here are also pretty amazing.  Try their seasonal bread puddings!!  I've tried two versions- one w/ white chocolate and another w/ liquors of dark chocolate and bourbon, perhaps?  I also enjoy a few appetizers offered at half-price during happy hour: buffalo wings, sliders w/ french fries, onion rings, and RIBS!  If you like citrus-y beverages, try Firebirds' signature martini, the Double Black Diamond- fresh pineapple steeped in citrus vodka and garnished w/ a pineapple slice!  

I did make a phone call about a month ago and found that HH appetizer selections have changed to reflect the seasons, so you may want to call ahead if you're like me and suffer from food allergies...

Last, but not least, while table and bar services here can be very spotty, management usually does a fine job w/ follow-ups and corrections.  I also enjoy the ambience here... reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of summers spent in Baguio, the summer capital of Luzon.  Woods, everywhere!  Beams, tables, chairs, floors, restrooms...  There's even a nice fireplace!"}

That and a loaded baked potato.
One of the others in our party ordered the filet, medium well.
The steaks arrived, and I was really looking forward to it, after the terrific salad...cut into it...hmm...kind of overdone...tried the other side...medium well...
My friend's filet was beautifully rare.
Neither of us were very happy about it.  
I feel guilty sending overcooked steaks back (hey, the cow gave it's all for the steak - don't throw it away) - good thing I got the chile rub - that made it acceptable.

Really disappointed - had the steak been cooked the way I ordered it, this would've gotten 5 stars.  :-("}

My comments are sometimes influenced by my previous experience working at a restaurant. 

Wait Time/Front Desk Staff: Our wait time for 2 people was quoted 30-40 min. We didn't mind waiting, but then people started showing up and being seated before us because they did a call ahead. Since it was our first time there, we didn't know they did call ahead. Personally, I think it's ridiculous for a restaurant to allow call ahead for parties less than 5. It's honestly ridiculous, since most of the people that were seated before us were only parties of 2. We also waited longer than our quoted time, by about 10-15 min more. Most of the front desk staff were just standing around doing nothing and talking to each other. None of them bothered tidying up around their area. They were just talking.

Server/Service: We weren't greeted for a good 15-20 min. I'm guessing the hostess sat us at a table and forgot to tell one of the servers to cover our table. Other tables that were seated after us, were greeted by their servers before our server came. I don't really blame the server since they probably didn't know. It's the front desk staff that should have notified the server. Our server was OK, but barely actually served us. The food runners that brought us our food. were a lot more friendly and responsive. We wished either of them were our server. 

Food Quality: The complimentary bread was good and big. We shared the onion rings as an appetizer and a full slab of ribs. The onion rings were amazingly delicious! Probably the best panko onion rings I've ever tried. The ribs were ok. I didn't really enjoy the sauce. There was a strong bitter after taste that I didn't like, but the meat fell off the bone nicely. 

Ambience: It's a little notch above casual, but not too upscale. The tables are relatively close to each other. Dim lighting. I didn't like that I could actually see the food line. Personally, I think that should be a behind the scenes kind of thing.

Overall, we'd come back for the food and do a reservation or call ahead next time."}

I've gone for dinner 4 or 5 times in the past 3-4 yrs which makes it about once a year...definitely good enough to return (we went last Friday night) but I think the reasons I don't return more often are:
a) a bit pricey ($5 for a side of mushrooms is kinda crazy)
b) menu is pretty limited and nothing is spectacular or even unique
c) there are so many other restaurants--especially in that Chandler Mall area--that something else always wins out

That being said, I've never had a bad experience. Steaks/Prime Rib have always been cooked exactly as I ordered and the Salmon is wonderful too. Wish the dinners came with a vegetable or salad as well as the potato but, alas...

Service has always been attentive and the hosting staff never snotty. Like the dimly lit lodge look of the place as well.

Yes, I would recommend this place but with price/menu caveats mentioned above."}

It's pretty cool to see the chef cook right in the front, our chef was entertaining enough to show off some of his skills to get our laughter. The food was decent, I had the Land n' Sea (filet mignon and scallops), especially with the 'meat sauce?'. The veggies were pretty good too, but our combination had a bit too much of onions, I think.

Overall the night was fun, however, with a pre-selected menu special for the graduate, I can't tell about the prices. I might have to come back my own to know it, lol"}

In spite of a few picky eaters in the group everyone was extremely happy with their meals.  Even my 7 year old nephew! Apparently they have a great kids menu... who knew?

This is not really my go-to restaurant since I usually prefer more ethnic or unique food.  But their all-American menu with a wide variety of well-prepared dishes makes them the perfect place to bring out of town guests.  Steaks, chops, salads... and for lunch a variety of burgers that are all fantastic with those wonderfully tasty sweet potato waffle fries!  I also am very addicted to their bread and the lobster cheese dip appetizer.

The service is always good.  Competent and friendly but still formal enough that you don't feel like you are at TGIFridays.  Even the decor is sort of a chain but not a chain.  A few stuff on the walls to make it clear that they have a theme but not overly kitchy.  Over the last few years we have taken a lot of people here and everyone always leaves happy.

I don't give out the 5 stars too often but this place for the food and the money is very good. I wouldn't put it into the best dinner I have ever had but I have to say the Filet I had was up there one of the best and for the price it was a good value compared to the usual high priced chain steak houses like Morton's or Ruth's Chris. We had a party of 12 with pretty short notice and they got us going and the service we excellent.

Highly recommended."}

It was about 2pm when we arrived. The hostess was on the phone and with a smile puts one finger in the air and puts her head back down. A manager comes behind her (she makes sure not to make eye contact with any of us) then turns around. Three other serves (who had nothing in their hands) walked right passed us. I said to myself "Hmmm... I hope the food isn't as bad as the hospitality." After standing and staring at the hostess for about six more minutes...we were seated.
Our server...forget her name...was genuine in her service. That's about all I can say. She forgot our Caesar salad (which is pretty bland) but the croûtons are ok. I ordered the Aspen Sirloin mid-rare. Texture reminded me of those stretchy hands n feet you used to get out of those little quarter machines back in the day and it tasted nothing like beef...straight salt. So I reordered the Filet Mignon. Now...I understand that it was on the fly...but there's no reason the center of the filet should be under 75degrees. NONE. The center was cold...I mean COLD.  By this point I'm starved and just ask for two minutes on each side. So the manager (yes the same from earlier) drops off my plate and it's clearly obvious she hates her job and shouldn't be there...especially in a management capacity. So after getting my medium steak back...it was wrapped with a nasty, slimy attempt at bacon. I'd give the steak itself (everything else aside) a 4.5.
I ask for a glass of malbec and the waitress looks at me with this perplexed look and goes..."Ummm...what's that?". LMFAO!!! I'm sorry you're in steakhouse and the waiter doesn't know a red wine when she hears it???? 
So after its all said and done my bill is presented. No GC, no taking care of my daughters plate, glass of wine...nothing. I'm NOT a moocher! By Any means. But being in the industry...I KNOW I WOULD NEVER EVER place an untouched bill in front of my guests who had the experience I had. Even if offered, I would have probably turned it down...but it's the principle. Show that you value your guests...they don't.
Pitiful management going on there. Nothing special about the place.

If you love commercial food, and don't really care about wasting your dollar...then this place is perfect for you. OH..in there defense the Salmon my wife ordered was pretty darn good and the sauce was well made. Hence the 2nd star. Had it not been for that, and like I said our genuine server (whom I left $20 on an $84 lunch)...I would take away a couple stars. NEVER going back."}

But once we are seated the service was excellant. The cooking table is a real good experience especially if it is your first time.  The servers were fast and the chefs are so energetic and funny that they will create a laughter riot throughout the cooking session. The food is cooked in front of you so you know exactly what goes into your stomach. 

I am a vegetarian so I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING DIFFERENT SPATULAS FOR VEGETARIANS which is not the case. Just one used for anything and everything from prawns to tofus.  

My husband is a lover of the chicken fried rice which he says is a must try.
Quantify is very very minimal for the meal portions so be prepared for a huge bill.
The meal comes with a complimentary ice cream and a birthday song sung by all the servers.

Overall a good experience and a must try place but with a lot of flaws."}

But not much more than that.  What got me a bit perturbed was that the whole attitude here reeks of some giant corporate machine (and how are we doing today, sir?  and how are we enjoying our meal sir?)  Everything was very expensive, too, and that knocks them down another notch.

A group of 6 of us arrived during happy hour, and had a wait of 20 minutes.  Not bad, and they were true to their word.  We bellied up to the bar and were informed that drinks were $5 (or was it $7) but only well drinks were that price.  Four martinis cost over $40.  Now I'm prepared to pay that in a big city, but this is suburban Chandler.  And it was happy hour!  Who drinks a vodka martini in a supposedly nice restaurant with well vodka?  Arrghhh, I am ranting now.

I had a salad and a steak.  The steak was a little overdone but tasty.  But then again, you can't screw up a ribeye too badly.  Nor a salad.  I can't even remember my side, I think it was mashed potatoes, and they tasted like, well, plain mashed potatoes.

Great decor, but I won't be back to see it again."}

It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P. 

Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. 

Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. 

Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. 

As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. 

At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. 

They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch. 

For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night."}

The fresh and crusty bread, served with real butter
The house martini! $10.00
The ginger/mango mojito! $10.50
The aged rib-eye, comes in three sizes (I got the 14 ounce)--have it cooked rare to medium rare. Any more done than this I think is overcooking a perfectly fine steak. The 14-ounce ribeye was $26+

So, for the food I think it deserves a 4+
And for the atmosphere, a 5 easily. It's very nice and inviting inside, and none of that snooty ambiance and attitude that I have come to associate with some high-end steak restaurants that I've been to. Besides, there's A Nordstrom in the same area, as well as an Ethan Allen across from the restaurant.

I am not sure if the Firebirds is a chain and if it is, that would be my only quibble since I would very much prefer to go to smaller and local places.

It started with the front hostess who was truly @!T%#. She had to be the most disrespectful and rudest person I've ever encountered in the restaurant business. Her attitude and demeanor reflected poorly on the restaurant and if I was Benihana corporate, I'd sue her for representing my company so badly.

My family and I immediately walked out and I proceeded to call the manager from my cell phone. The person who answered the phone claimed to be the manager and apologized to no end about the poor treatment we received. She took my name & number down and promised to call me back the next day in order to get my mailing address because she promised a gift certificate in response to the issue. Its been 3 days since we visited this location and still no phone call from that manager.

I love their ginger dressing, it's not like anything I've ever had. Over the years I have even purchased it. I am a fan of shrimp and this restaurant has my favorite shrimp.

They open for dinner at 5. When we walked in the place was empty and they still quoted us a hour. We waited the full hour in the bar ($57.00 for two MaiTai and 2 house wines). After the hour was up we asked how long the wait was and they said "your Edward right?" I replied no John and that is when they let me know they dropped us off the list. They did not know why we were no longer on the list. The only thing they could say was " we don't know why this happens but it will now be another 35 to 45 min.

Needless to say I'm done trying this location. I also saw 4 other parties leave as soon as they walked in and got such a long wait time quote. All of this happened when the restaurant was 65 to 75% empty!!!

The sushi always taste fresh and delicious. It was my first time getting the Hibachi steak  and lobster, both had a lot of flavor. It's  seasoned with butter, salt, pepper, and Japanese butter. 

They accidentally gave us the wrong sushi roll so we got one for free, that was pretty cool.

We love the Arrowhead location, and expected this location to be up to standard. 

   Service was good. Other than the table not being completely prebussed/crumbed, no major complaints. Our drinks were always full and food came in a timely manner. 

  All 5 of our filet mignon were underdone. The medium rare steaks came out rare, and my medium steak came out medium rare. We aren't sending back 5 steaks. Ive been in the industry for 9 years, I'd rather eat an underdone steak than send it back. 

  I start to get into my steak, and I realize that it is unbelievably charred, which I normally don't mind. Im pretty used to eating burned food, considering my cooking skills. The char is so bad that I can't taste the steak at all. I am pretty sure there was no salt put on the steak before it was cooked.

  The steak had me puzzled. About 5 bites in I realize that it isn't filet mignon. My suspicion is validated when I steal a bite of my boyfriends steak. Everyone else's filet is wrapped in bacon, mine is not. 

  I had to be at work later that day, and was already short on time. I did not have the option to wait for another steak to be cooked. Also did not want to cause a scene in front of my boyfriends parents. As someone who will do whatever possible to avoid sending anything back, I would have sent back this steak if I had the time to. 

  Also, several of the Au Gratin potatoes in the mix were still raw. Super unpleasant to be picking raw potatoes out of a mouth full of chewed food. Also super unpleasant to eat said raw potatoes.

  I don't eat fish, so I can't tell you how the ahi was.  (Ahi? Mahi? Not even sure if I'm saying it right) However, I overheard my boyfriends dad saying he liked the salad better than the fish. No ahi went uneaten though!

  The creme brulee cheesecake is great as always. Having worked at several bars/restaurants, I did find it odd that they did not have one of the desserts comp'ed for a birthday. 

  When presented the bill, I noticed that I was charged for the 9oz filet that I ordered but instead got something of lower quality and price. My boyfriend was super pissed, and told me to tell our server to charge me for what I was given (probably a sirloin, no salt/pepper, extra char lol). I could tell it caught our server off guard since everything seemed fine. She ended up comping the entire steak. Which was cool of her, because even though I do like sirloin nornally, this steak was SO bad. 

  Overall, service was great, food was terrible. I would not go back here. It was kind of embarrassing since we talked up the place so much. The whole time I was wishing they came to our side of town and had dinner at "our" firebirds (Arrowhead)"}

It seemed appealing so my mom and I decided to try it. The service was ok. Our first waitress was awesome. Then we got a new waiter for some reason and he was alright. My mom ordered the prime rib with a baked potato and I ordered the sirloin with mashed potatoes and we both got a green salad. Her prime rib was cooked medium well and my sirloin was cooked medium. My steak was burnt on the outside and really pink on the inside. It didn't taste too bad but it was hard to chew as it wasn't very tender. For the price of the food I at least expected it to come with 2 sides but you only get one and you can add more for a not so good price. After we were done spending our $69 plus tip on mediocre food and drinks we went home and we both started to feel sick. So we went to bed. The next day aka today we both had upset stomachs, the chills, and nausea. I have been throwing up and have been in and out of the bathroom all day. I have a headache and I am weak. I think it's safe to say we got food poisoning. Next time I will get a decent steak/meal at a good price at Texas Roadhouse. I'm mad that I spent $80 just to get sick off of this food. Never again!"}

I signed up for their birthday club, and received a voucher for $30 towards a birthday meal.  That's pretty huge, and I'm very grateful.

But I have to calls em like I sees em.

Let's start at the beginning.  The salad had a bit too much dressing on it.  Check out my photo of what was left at the bottom of my salad bowl and see for yourself.  I think the folks over at The Sushi Room have got a good grasp on salad dressing.

The caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls were fantastic tasting and a good size.  This would be a great place for HH.

I came here with my daughter.  We both wanted Chicken Yakisoba.  She ordered off of the lunch menu (around $8), and I ordered off the dinner menu (around $18) since I had the $30 credit.  Imaging my surprise when the waitress brought out two places of equal portions.  Where did the extra $10 go?  Oh yes, I did get a soup with my entree.

Their yakisoba was just ok.  The chicken was a bit dry and the noodles had a taste I was not accustomed to.  Not terrible, but not a dish I'll be returning for anytime soon.

When we were done, the waitress brought individually wrapped hand towels, something I would expect at a BBQ joint.  But Wow!!!  These hand towels are awesome.  So big and thick.  I wish Buffalo Wild Wings would give you these kind of hand towels, instead of the little thin ones that burn your hands and smell of lemon.

For dessert, a large scoop of green tea ice cream, and a fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  Both were excellent.  I would order these again.

And to top it off, the manager sauntered over to where we were seated and asked if we would like our picture taken.  I affirmed, and assumed a lean-over-the-table pose.  No more than two minutes later, he returned with a nicely framed picture of my birthday guests.  Superb!  100% impressed.

Once again, thank you Benihana for making an otherwise normal birthday meal, special.  I'll be back for HH and desserts."}

Even if Arizona's Benihana's doesn't resemble the authenticism of those in San Francisco.  The cooks in Arizona are generally NOT asian, which really is my only disappointment with these local restaurants. It just gives it another feel.

However, the food is great, the atmosphere is nice.

Just some advise:

The tables sit 8 people.  Try to go with a large group or you will get stuck with several strangers (loud, obnoxious and drunk perhaps?).  It's not really a romantic setting in those conditions.  

Also, allow over 2 hrs for dinner.  We got there at 6:30 and left at 8pm (we made it just in time for our movie at 8:25pm).  

I will go again, next time, with a larger group."}

There were six of us, and another couple was seated at our table. One of my gripes with this style of cooking, is that the dining space is super tiny. With all of our drinks (one each) at the table, there was hardly any room for error. Either way, our server was super nice and took very good care of us. The meal was good, albeit expensive, which is what one should expect when going to Beniana's. Everything was cooked great though, very fresh and yummy. This is definitely a place that you come for the experience as well as the food."}

If that's all you want to know, feel free to click off this review.  That said, I found much to love about Rudy's during my first visit here.  I'd known about Rudy's for over a decade thanks to a BBQ feature I'd seen on the Travel Channel way back when.  Once I found out they were opening a location here in the valley, I knew I'd eventually end up here.  Okay, it took awhile, but I'm finally here.  On a Saturday at dinner time, let's sample this taste of Texas.

You'll find Rudy's Chandler location on the north side of Chandler Boulevard, just a few blocks east of the I-10 freeway.  Originally founded in Leon Springs, Texas in 1989, Rudy's now has three dozen barbecue joints around the country.  Including three here in the valley (Gilbert and Goodyear being the other two).  Despite its chain status, Rudy's goes to some pretty good lengths to model their locations after their original.  Simple pits slow cooking the meat, a market style counter up front, a convenience store near the front entrance, and picnic style seating to boot.  The Chandler location can easily hold a couple hundred patrons, though finding a table for myself was fairly easy this go around.

I mentioned to the gal at the counter that this was indeed my first Rudy's visit, and almost immediately she spoiled me with free sample after free sample of food.  I sampled the brisket, the pork, the turkey, the beans, the corn, the green chile stew, and even a sausage.  Afraid she'd make me full before I ordered my meal, I told her I was good and ready to decide.  I got a regular half sausage link, a pulled pork sandwich, corn, beans, their banana pudding dessert, and a fountain drink (refills are free, FYI).  Total cost for all of this food and drink including tax came to a very reasonable $20.  

They put all the goodies in my tray (which kinda looks like a soda carrier) and I sat myself down.  The meats were nicely smoked and pretty decent, though somewhat bland without sauce.  Fortunately Rudy's does offer a pair of sauce options.  Their regular sauce and their milder "Sissy" sauce.  The regular is on the spicier end, but far more flavorful than the Sissy.  The beans here also have a little bit of a spicy kick so bear that in mind.  With the regular sauce, my pork and sausage were both quite satisfying.  The banana pudding was a nice cooling finish with a mix of bananas, cream, whipped cream, and vanilla wafers to boot.

So again, it's not Little Miss.  None of the meats at Rudy's that I tried stack up to what Scott Holmes and his staff can create (though Rudy's sides can certainly hold their own).  But I kept my expectations tempered and came out pretty happy with my experience.  The portions, the price, and especially the service I received at the front counter were all excellent.  In summary, an affordable family friendly suburban BBQ joint in the same realm as a Famous Dave's.  Take that comparison however you wish.  For southeast valley residents not wanting to drive to Little Miss for lunch and wait for hours, chances are you'll find Rudy's a respectable backup plan."}

We like it so much we drive out of our way to eat there. We frequent Abuelos where ever we find them including but not limited Phoenix, Chandler and Kansas City MO. 

So for my wife and I to give a 1 star should hopefully get the attention of the owners. We were extremely disappointed with the food and lack of service during our last few visits to the Chandler location. I would bet on it that the management were not there yesterday during our visit because there was a lack luster attention to service period. 

We arrived at 330pm, to find 3 seated tables and a bunch of staff some making eye contact with us as we stood there waiting to be seated. As we stood in the lobby waiting to be seated for 10mins, I turned around to walk out before my wife waved down a waiter who noticed us when we first walked in to seat us. The host was no where to be found but did show as the waiter grabbed the menus. Out of the corner of my eye the host gave our waiter a dirty look, yes I did see that rudeness coming from the host with long black hair. I'm kinda glad someone decided to do her job. But after the food and service, I should have went with my gut feeling and walked out. After all, going to eat at the odd hour has its chance of being served leftover dried out food, but I felt Abuelos was a different place to eat, NOT SO.  


The Pasta La Paz my favorite was lacking sauce, the chicken was dried up leftovers from lunch and had been placed under the salamander to heat then left on the counter to cool to less than room temp when served. My wife's fajitas tacos where not fajita stips but chopped up leftover beef from the lunch. 

We pushed out empty drink glasses to the edge of the table for refills which finally got filled after 15mins. We could not wait to get out of there, we are so disappointed since we loved this place so much. 

We started noticing this on the last few visits, when we have ate there during off hours. Sadly,  I won't spend another $40 to find out if they have change, that was our purpose for our recent visit. We enjoyed our multiple monthly visits to Abuelos, but that will not be the case any longer. 

Hope this helps improve on what once was a great experiences for us."}

I usually order their spare ribs and their lean brisket when I go.  They try to push their moist brisket, but it is a fattier cut of meat.  Trust me..... the lean brisket is plenty moist!  The spare ribs are a decent size, but you won't get much bang for your buck since you order by the 1/4 pound.  Usually 1 pound of ribs is about 6 ribs.  The meat is smoked to perfection.  I have also tried the moist briket (good, but fatty), the baby back ribs (also good), and the pulled pork which was also very good.  I get their Sissy Sauce for my ribs and brisket.  It is wonderful.  It has just the right amount of heat for me.  They also have a spicier sauce, but I haven't braved it.  

As for their sides, the only one I have tried and really liked was their green chile stew.  It has a great flavor.  It seems to get hotter with every bite.  Usually by the time I finish my small cup, my mouth is on fire and my nose is running.  Worth it though, since the flavor is so good.  This place is my favorite BBQ spot in the valley."}

Rudy's is a fun place to go, and as bbq joints go in AZ it is ok.   I have been twice now.  One time the line was out the door and took 35 minutes to get to the counter.  No drink service or anyone walking the line while we were waiting in that long line which surprised. me. 

First time there I got Coleslaw, the loaded potato with meat, and pork ribs.  I think the potato is the best deal in the place, it comes loaded with almost a full order of meat for the same price as an order of meat.  I had the briscuit, which was very very good.   As I have found from most bbq joints here, the coleslaw was bland, and the ribs were ok, a little overcooked.

Second time I went I had baby backs and jalapeno sausage.  Sausage was spicy and good, I am a sucker for a sausage, .  Babybacks were ok, they were pulled out of the smoker a little soon, and not falling off the bone tender.  I did have a couple of ribs on the end that got a little more heat and were decent..  it seems they do not use much spice on the ribs either and were a little bland.

Rudy's staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Because it is so new, it is not a place for a fast meal, but give it time.  It will slow down and you can drop in for a sandwich with out a 30 minute wait to order. 

Try the Briscuit and the pulled pork, I think the best things on the menu.  

Great place for the family to go and eat.  Have a good time."}

That alone wouldn't be enough to get a new review out of me, but they apparently addressed the problem I highlighted last time.  This time the brisket had a wonderful smoky flavor.  Not overpowering, but very distinctly present.  This is more like the Rudy's I knew a year or more ago.  I'd say today was a 4-star meal, but I won't give them that for two reasons.  First, inconsistency.  Six months ago their meat had no smoke flavor at all.  Six months before that it did, and today it did.  I'd like more consistency and reliability in the quality of the meal.  And second, there was a coal in my green chili stew.  They tried to say it was just a "burnt end".  No, it was a piece of burned wood.  I know the difference.  However, to their credit they offered to replace the stew and gave us a gift card to come back.  I have to give management credit when they try to make something right.

Despite that one bit of wood, their stew really is great.  Perhaps the best thing they do.  Good stuff."}

Rudy's is one of the better Barbecue places in the valley! When you walk in the atmosphere and smells make you feel like you are at an authentic barbecue restaurant. The staff is very up beat and service is fast. Had the beef brisket sandwich with a baked potato and neither one disappointed. The Potato was HUGE, and very freshly cooked! Wished they offered more sides on the menu, but I was very satisfied overall! Don't miss out on the opportunity to check this place out for lunch, dinner or anytime you are just craving barbecue. Just typing this review about the place makes me want to go back now!"}

A friend of mine said, "I am coming up from Tucson and Rudy's is on the way to your house I am bringing breakfast." OK, well I'm game for anything. 

He brought the breakfast tacos. First its more like a breakfast burrito its big for a taco. Secondly, it was utterly amazing. Apparently they take the left over brisket and trimmings from the night before, marinate it in BBQ sauce and BAM that's the breakfast taco ingredients. I have been craving another one ever since Friday morning when I had mine.

I cannot wait to go try Rudy's for dinner. I have tried Bobby Q's, Famous Daves, Dickey's, and Brian's up in Cave Creek, this was BY FAR the best I have had in the valley!! 

Highly recommended!"}

I loved it the first time I came here and not much has changed, to be honest. The food is always on point and delicious and I love the atmosphere in Abuelo's. I met my party here so I can't comment on how long it took for us to get our table but I will say that it took several minutes for us to get greeted by our server. However, once she got to us, it was mostly smooth sailing from there.

I think one of the things I love the most about Abuelo's is how extensive the menu is - there's bound to be something for everyone! For me, their enchiladas are what I go for immediately. I don't like red enchilada sauce (cardinal sin to some, I'm sure) so I love that they have not only  a green sauce, but a few others that I can put on top of my enchiladas. Personally, my favorite is their sour cream sauce. Seriously so good! I also had their swirled margarita, which is a traditional margarita with a sangria swirl. Whoever thought of this needs a medal, because it was amazing!

Overall, I really enjoy Abuelo's but I think that the attentiveness of their servers could improve."}

Think Texas or Kansas style, or a combination of the two. Since moving to Arizona I've had a very difficult time finding BBQ that meets up to my standards... Congratulations to Rudy's for being the first!

I ordered the moist (AKA fatty) brisket, and the jalapeno sausage. The meat was full of flavor, moist as promised, and without a hint of artificial smoke flavoring.  I tried the Rudy's beans and the potato salad on the side; the beans were great, but the potato salad was just OK. To be fair, I'm extremely picky about potato salad. For desert, the banana pudding and the peach cobbler made me feel like I was back home.

A couple of tips:

*Servings are family style so go with at least one friend, or have a huge appetite.
*Beer and drinks are served in a bucket, and your food is served in a basket.
*There will be families with kids, so be prepared for all that comes with that.
*Rudy's provides everything you need to take your left-overs, and everything reheats well.

It's great to know that I can have great BBQ more often than when I go back home to see family! I'll definitely be back!"}

Nothing was bad, but everything was average. Guacamole had flavor, but texture was like it came straight out of a gallon tin can. I had the chile relleno plate.  Enjoyed the shredded beef relleno, but did not finish my plate.

Lets start with the Sangria. Mmmmm. That was some good stuff! The chips come out with three differnt salsa's. I loved 2 of the 3 and there was nothing wrong with the 3rd, just not my cup of tea. I had a shredded beef burrito smothered in cheese with guacamole. It was really good. Very flavorful and I would get it again in a second. The rice and beans were very good as well but next time I want to try the potatoes with chili. I had a bite of someone elses plate and they were fantastic, I was very jealous!

I only had one negative on our dining experience; my favorite thing about Abuelos was their cold beer in the ice frosted Margarita glasses, however today my beer was served in regular glasses. The beer was not cold, so I was disappointed.  I still left Chip a generous tip, and he told me they did not have these glasses,...what  a disappointment. Still give them 5 stars for meal n service but 4 stars for the beer failure. Overall 4.5 stars for this place."}

I work right around the corner and have been to the place across the street several times and figured it was time to give this place a shot.

It was almost 2 PM when I arrived and I was greeted by someone who explained how the placed worked.  I was able to walk right up and order, but I've seen the line backed out the door on more than one occasion so it was definitely the time of day (I purposely went later to avoid the crowds).  

I ordered a 1/2 lb of smoked turkey, half a sausage link, pinto beans, and a large drink for just under $14.  The turkey was moist & tender but I didn't taste much of a smoked flavor.  It wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't great.  The sausage was good also.  I like spicy, so I only tried the spicy bbq sauce.  I found the stoppers on the bbq sauce bottles to be cumbersome to get an appreciable amount of sauce to come out.  I actually didn't care for the sauce, as it had an overly-tangy flavor which overwhelmed the meats.  I really prefer when a bbq place has the big kettle of sauce as opposed to bottled sauce.  The beans...well they were OK...definitely no pizzazz to them...for just being plain pinto beans, they were decent, but definitely not great....if I go again, I'll probably try the cole slaw instead.

I've been to a few mom & pop bbq joints in Tx and Rudy's does a good job of duplicating that ambiance.  Bare concrete floors, long rows of tables with paper table cloths on one side and picnic tables on the other...and that open ceiling architecture.....I can imagine the how loud and echoie (is that a word???) the place gets when it's packed!

I read some reviews complaining about the wax paper in lieu of a plate....sure enough, my paper split open while cutting off a bite of sausage...exposing it to the table.  Hope it was clean...I ate it anyway  lol  

I'm giving Rudy's 3 stars because I think it's OK, but not great.  I will go back and try the moist brisket to see how that goes.

Good Eats,

In my quest for the best BBQ joint(s) in AZ, I heard about this place, I had to try it.

As I rolled into the parking lot, I noticed it was packed, so I'm thinking right away, this must be good, but I'm not getting my hopes up yet. From the outside, it looked like a nice little country store.

I walk inside and immediately I'm looking for the smell of smoke - nope not happening. No smoke, from previous experiences, no taste. Oh well, I'm still willing to give them a shot. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice - wooden bench type seating - like you would find at a picnic in the country. 

I am greeted right away by a friendly little hostess, "High how are you? Is this your first time here at Rudy's?" - Yes, I say, and she began to tell me the process for ordering food - "You stand in line here and you order at the cashier counter." I asked the hostess what type of wood is used. "Hmm, I don't know" was the response - and she proceeded to help the next customer in line.

So I get in this serpentine line like being herded like cattle. There is this beverage trough with various kinds of liquids, mostly alcohol, where you grab and hold while waiting in line.

As I'm waiting in line, I notice the prices, from $1.99 to $6.49 for the various cuts of meat. Pretty much keeping up with the other restaurants around the valley I've sampled. I then noticed something that peeked my interest - a sign that said, "Real Texas BBQ." I immediately said, "hmmmm - I'll be the judge of that."

I continue to make my way around the line and I see people carrying these black plastic type of boxes with food in it. I was OK - easy to carry your food and stuff - no plates. 

I get up to the counter  and I placed my order: 1/2 pound of lean brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and turkey. I then ask the cashier what type of wood is used. Response - "I don't know." Another person was asked -- response - "I don't know. I can find out." My response - yes please. The other person returned with an answer of "Oak." I asked what else besides Oak. "Nothing else." Ding ding ding ding - I immediately said, "then this is not real Texas BBQ, you can't say it is." One of the biggest staples of wood in Texas is mesquite - I personally use a combination of Hickory and Mesquite -

My order comes, and I leave for home to taste my morsels of goodies.

ANALYSIS: The best part of the meats was the turkey. It had a lot of flavor and was somewhat moist. The sausage was a little spicy and had a good flavor as well. The ribs were a little on the under cooked side and lacked seasoning and smoke flavor. The brisket was a bit dry, a little rare spots, and lacked flavor/seasoning and the oh so famous smoke ring - where's the ring. The pulled pork was very lacking in flavor and it didn't have a very pleasant taste. My family - very picky when it comes to the Q, did not care for the meats very much. They did like the turkey. OVERALL RATING: I'm still searching. But, I would say - go, give it a try and make your own conclusions."}

I'm a born and raised Texan, and Rudy's was my favorite BBQ quick stop when I lived there.  I missed good BBQ when I moved to Phoenix.

Even though I live on the west side of town, we are always willing to drive 45 minutes to this location to get some create your own breakfast tacos from Rudy's.  We even purchase extra tacos to take home for breakfast the next morning :)

The sandwiches and potato salad are also fantastic.  As a last reminder: don't skip out on dessert!"}

Walking in I felt right at home, with the rustic/Texas vibe. I had fun picking a beer to accompany my meal out of the big troughs that separate the lines to the ordering counter. The wait wasn't too bad, and I thought it was really cool that they cut and weigh the meat right in front of you. I ordered several different items, some for immediate consumption and some to take home. For my in-restaurant dining, I opted for a brisket sandwich and half of a regular sausage and I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket, 1/2 lb of sauced chop, and a tub of potato salad to bring home. The sausage was very good, the casing had a nice crisp snap to it while chomping it down. I got a little out of control with the regular bbq sauce, and I found that it was a little spicier than I normally go for (the have a Sissy sauce which is more my speed, guess I'm a sissy). The food that I brought home was a nice snack for football Sunday, and my fiancee enjoyed it as well (she's also a Memphis BBQ snob). 

This place is a no frills, good ole BBQ joint, that is fun and would be a blast to bring a big group to. I would definitely come back, and I would like to try some of the other offerings they have on the menu."}

If you're dining in, you order your food at the counter. The line can get pretty long, but they have many cashiers and an efficient food serving set-up so the line moves quickly. The line is partitioned by beverages/beverage holders that you can pick up as you're waiting in line. They have the various specialty sodas, pre-cupped wines. You can also purchase a cup from the cashier for fountain beverages. Desserts are available in a refrigerator at the very front of the line. They have the usual meat options including brisket, pork, chicken, sausage. They also have a bunch of sides from which you can choose. Food is ordered by weight and listed pricing was  by 0.5lbs. I ordered few items but only pricing I could remember was $7.15/half pound lean brisket. I thought it was pretty reasonable and remember thinking that about the remainder of the food options. The food itself was was pretty tasty! The brisket was very juicy, and the pulled pork had a very distinct flavor. It was sweet but peppery. I thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the chocolate pudding, banana pudding, and pecan pie. If there was one con to this place, it would be the desserts. I thought they were humdrum in taste.

Seating options are plentiful and well-kept. When a customer left, staff would come shortly after to ensure the table was clean. They also walked around and removed trash during our meal. As we were ordering, the cashiers wiped down the counter between customers and even the food serving counter was repeatedly wiped. I appreciate the attention to cleanliness!

The employees were all extremely helpful and kind. We were acknowledged at every point of our visit, which particularly impressed me since we were there when it was rather busy."}

I got Prime Rib and Beef Brisket along with corn-on-the-cob. As you can probably tell from my "pro tip" above, the Prime Rib was AWESOME! So juicy and full of flavor.

There are lots of picnic-table style seatings, some red and white checkerboard table cloths, and a trough full of bottles of beer and soda, surrounded by ice.

We walked up to the counter to order, and from that second, it was a 5-star experience.  The girl at the counter was really friendly, and gave us samples since we had never been there before, so we could figure out what we wanted.  The cook/bbq'er/meat cutter behind the counter was having a good time, yelling back for help whenever people were waiting, and getting excited whenever someone new came in and wanted to try samples.

The food was absolutely amazing.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's BBQ, so don't expect exotic plating, but if you want delicious meat on a bun or baked potato, and want to walk away full and satisfied, this is the joint.  It was too hot when we went, but in nicer weather it looks like they open up all of the walls to the outside, which I'm sure makes the atmosphere that much better.  I can imagine returning when it's nicer out, grabbing a few brews, and killing an hour just sitting in the breeze and getting fat off of pulled pork.

There was only one thing I didn't like about Rudy's, and that was the country music playing the entire time, but hey - if you like country music, then YEEEEE HAAAWW GOOD BUDDY go ahead and enjoy that, and even if you don't, it wasn't enough for me to knock a star off of the rating."}

I walked in not knowing the terrain was greeted by some young man who quickly pointed me in the right direction. After looking over the menu, I quickly decided I was only going to purchase the smoke meat products and make my own sides. Sides add up $$. The cashier was extremely helpful in telling me how much I should order for my party of 4. I ordered 3 lbs. of Pulled Pork, 1 lbs. Baby Back Ribs, 1/2 lbs. Moist Brisket. She had also given me a generous amount of sauce. I also loved all the goodies at the side bar, hot Cherry Peppers, Jalapenos, Onions, Pickles, Bread, forks knifes and extra sauces etc. They even supply little baggies to put them in to take out. So my bill for just that amount of meat was $44.00. Now Everyone knows meat is heavy so price per pound amount is not cheap.

I will say it was pretty good, could be a little more smokier tasting though. With all the BBQ places in town there is a lot of competition. Would I go back? Yes to do take meat if I was in a pinch for that smoky flavor that they need to kick-up a bit."}

I am just a little disappointed that I have lived here for a year and I am just finding out about this location. What's up with that?

I have been a HUGE fan of Rudy's in Albuquerque, NM for years now. Even made special trips to ABQ just to go to Rudy's . . . and now I find out there is one just a couple miles from my house . . . geez! You mean I could have been eating here all along?

I was out tooling around on a Sunday afternoon thinking I was either going to have to go home or find myself a drive-thru because I was just not going to make it until dinner time . . .  when I saw the sign: **RUDY'S!**  I nearly caused a major pile-up on Chandler Blvd as I whipped my little black Honda around in traffic and scooted into the parking lot, jumped into the only empty space and went inside. I could not believe that this little bit of BBQ heaven was right here in Chandler. 

I didn't even have to look at a menu. Pulled pork sandwich, creamed corn, potato salad and a beer, please.  I found myself a small table on the patio and literately scarfed that dreamy sandwich down with occasional bites of creamed corn & potato salad and then washed it all down with an ice cold beer.

Best BBQ on the planet and now it's here within a short car ride, not a plane ride. Heaven, right here on earth . . . er, Arizona!"}

Baby back ribs (1/2 pound) - delicious and recommend.
Brisket (cutter's choice) (1 pound) - delicious and recommend.  Cutter's choice just means you'll get some combination of moist and lean brisket.
Cream corn (pint) - outstanding!  You will not be disappointed.
Slice of pecan pie - pretty good but doubt you'll need it after ordering a bunch of meat.  I took a couple of bites and took the rest home.

I stuck with the two chicken tacos because I didn't have a big appetite but one taco made me full. The next time I come, I will bring my appetite and gift card from Costco. Lol."}

We also ordered a chimichanga. It had solid flavor and good presentation
The fajita salad was really marginal. Greens felt like out of a bag. Steak Was under seasoned and cold

Dinner has so many choices, but I will only name the two I rotate between. I am a huge Chile Rellenos fan, I order them every where I go and I am particular about where to get the good ones. Abuelo's has excellent Chile Rellenos!

The next dish that is probably the best one on the menu and they know it, is their LOS MEJORES DE LA CASA, which is 2 small perfectly cooked bacon wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and 2 shrimp with bacon, cheese and jalapenos, mmmmm so so so Good!!! Good along with all its synonyms in the thesaurus!!!

The cafeteria style ordering is I guess okay, but getting ur food in a milk crate and then eating off a piece of paper was not appealing. We ordered the turkey, baby back ribs, corn on the cob, and the store bought coleslaw and potato salad. I will say the smoked turkey was delicious, and just full of flavor. The baby back ribs, eh.. The corn on the cob wasn't that good either, kinda tasted like it's been sitting on the cooler then brought back out and re-boiled. Would I return, most likely not given the fact that there are other places through out the valley to try. The price was decent, figure that u will spend about 12-15 a person, you order by the half pound and grab your store bought sides from the cooler. Well if you decide to visit, stick with the turkey cuz the meats arent that good, Well in my opinion."}

The people there are very courteous.  They are also extremely helpful.  The place is always clean, and they work really fast.  I am never dissatisfied when we visit.  It isn't as interactive as the San Antonio ones, but it works for the people out here.  I love it...
My husband loves the moist brisket and beans.  I love the spicy chop.  My kids love the chicken.  And, my brother said the ribs are awesome.  We always grab some Rudy's sauce to bring home with us.

I recommend the Pescado Guerrero - a wood-grilled tender mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced avocado in a white wine sauce. Yes, I totally stole that description from their website, although I did remove the word 'delicious', since I'd already used it in the previous sentence. Thought it might sound a little too repetitive if I left it in, two deliciouses so close together. Not that this dish doesn't deserve 'em both, it's just that I'm not one to repeat things unnecessarily. Omit needless words, that's what Strunk & White would say. Sharp guys. Not big Yelpers, from what I understand, but still good advice nevertheless... Although, used correctly, repetition can be an excellent rhetorical strategy for producing emphasis, clarity, amplification, even emotional effect. I guess Joe Walsh was right, there are two side to every story.

Oh, and I'd stay away from the Fundido del Mar appetizer. A little too much fondue and not enough shrimp & scallops."}

There are no "to go" boxes, you have to wrap your meat in a brown paper bag. Some restaurants do their own thing that makes them cool, but no... meat sliding around in a bag doesn't sound clean or secure.

One job assignment took me by the location every day for a week and I ate at Rudy's every day for lunch.   I am hooked on the extra lean brisket, corn on the cob (swimming in butter...yum!) and the banana pudding.   I love that the meat isn't already covered in sauce because the meat really doesn't need it, but also, I like a very specific amount and others rarely get it right.   I order the brisket extra lean because I hate paying for "fat." They get it right every time.  The banana pudding has Vanilla Wafers as a faux crust and I love the blend of pudding and cookie.   It completely reminds me of what my grandmother would make if she ever made something like this.

I shared other reviewer's frustrations about the sauce and the bottles, but I've gone to Rudy's so many times now that I know how to tip/shake the bottle to dispense the correct amount of sauce.  It's really not that annoying, but I can see how first time visitors would think, "Am I doing this right?"

While you run the risk of sitting next to people you don't know, there is plenty of seating indoors and in the covered patio.

My only suggestion on ways to make this location better would be to make the order placing area bigger.  During busy times, it's difficult to navigate through the crowds at closer registers to registers down the line.  Larger families prohibit access to the salad and dessert refrigerator until the next cashier is literally shouting, "NEXT IN LINE."   I've had a cashier repeatedly shout at me to come to the register as I was frantically trying to get my side dishes and banana pudding from the 'fridge.    It temporarily ticked me off, but the friendliness she showed once I got to the register negated the impact of the shouting.

All in all, I happily make the 30 minute trek to Rudy's just to sit, talk and enjoy!"}

The primary reason? Well, the really good quality food, of course. But more than that, this is a place that has quality food for all types of people. My mother is someone who very rarely eats Mexican food because the spice (and really ANY spice at all) is too much for her. I, on the other hand, like things fairly spicy. Others prefer to be sweating heavily into their dishes...so understandably, the wide variety of preference can be hard to cater to. This place has it all, and did I say quality? Quality food here. Just quality...

...And quantity! Pretty big dishes. Others have complained about the severs but I've never had a problem. Drinks stay full, people are nice and are not hovering over your table constantly. Ive never been spoken to rudely or any of that nonsense, just kind of typical average dinner-going experiences all around.

The decor and atmosphere are quite nice. You really get the feeling you're in some fancy casita owned by some drug lord somewhere in Mexico. Was that racist? Whatever. Its inviting, its a little flashy, it gives your eyes somewhere to wander if your date is boring as sin.

They have their own unique spin on things for a restaurant of this type: ie offering potatoes as an option to rice & beans, monstrous combo plates, etc. I like that because it makes it an experience you're really not going to find elsewhere too easily. Keeps me coming back.

Overall, I highly recommend this place. Yeah its gringo mex fare, but its pretty delicious anyway. Great place to have a beer or five with your meal, and I think you'll be coming back often as well."}

We like the dip trio app (queso, creamy guac, and chili con queso), fajitas, Laredo & Juarez combo plates, chicken medallions and build your own enchilada plate. The papas are delish, like Mexican cheesy mashed potatoes. The refried beans and rice are really well-seasoned as well. Our picky toddler makes "mmmmm" grunting noises whenever he eats the food here. You KNOW it's good. If it's your first time, you can't go wrong with a combo plate, which is awesome when I'm indecisive.

Amazing. To sum it up...it is amazing. It was a bit of a drive for us but well worth it. We loved everything about this place. I had the sausage which was perfection and my husband had the brisket. (He even went back to get more lol) They even were able to give us a small portion of meat for my daughter. The potato salad is great and I love the inside set up. It's like a big picnic. 

When we are up for the drive again we will be back for sure. Best BBQ I have had here in AZ so far."}

Watching we caught on winding up to the counter to order we passed many bottle drinks in ice and a refer with sides. In line we made it to the order desk and got our beef or pork order. It doesn't say much about what one orders but it is by the 1/2 lb. or the sandwich. The food was good and  after the cleanup easy as they have a novel wash up sink for those with hands sticky with BBQ sauce. 
The 2 of us spend $20 with no drinks. We drink water when out as so much profit is in soda drink which are bad for one anyway. I don't like drinking candybars."}

It reminds me of a Boiling Crab or Angry Crab type of place.  You can eat with your bbq-sauce-covered hands, and wash it clean at the wash station, except this is much easier to clean off without smelling like fishy hands after scrubbing for so long.  

Anyway, you go in and order from a simple menu - easy to read and not much figuring out to do.  We ordered a brisket sandwich, turkey sandwich, and 1/2 pound baby back ribs.  It is prepared and ready to go - just like that!  Then you bring it over to the picnic-like long tables where you share with fellow hungry people.  Sauces are placed on the table so you can pour it right on the table.  But first you have to go to the paper roll and rip off a piece to place on the table.  Collect your utensils and drinks at the appropriate stations.  Then chow down.  I tried the Sissy sauce because I am a sissy when it comes to hot sauces.  I also tried the BBQ sauce and enjoyed both flavors.  But tasting the smoked baby back ribs by itself without the sauce was also tasty.  You can tell that it's tender and juicy.  The taste is different from it being grilled, but just as good!"}

I came with my family, and without someone explaining to us how it worked, we would've been somewhat lost on how to order. Thankfully, the cashier was nice and offered us samples. I usually go for brisket at a BBQ place, but I thought Rudy's was a bit dry and lacking flavor. I'm not sure which one we tried; you can order the brisket three different ways depending on how lean you want your cut. The pulled pork and the turkey were really good, juicy and full of flavor. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Meat came on a standard hamburger bun; it would be nice if it was toasted, but it didn't look like mine was.

With all the sides being a la carte, meals add up quickly. I didn't try any sides, but my family members did. You have to grab your silverware, drinks, and condiments. I thought the Rudy's "sause" (not sure why they spell it as such) was good, but they had a wimpy version with less heat, which I didn't find necessary, because the regular didn't seem spicy. I thought my sandwich was decent, but none of my family members raved about their food. You also have to clean up after yourself, which is fine, but I guess I wasn't expecting that. It's more of a fast food place, I suppose. It was good for a quick dinner, and we were hungry. If we had time, we would've gone to Bobby Q, because that place is excellent."}

The best part of the meal was easily the spicy brisket. It was so moist and flavorful, and not too spicy. I wasn't too big of a fan of the ribs and needed to add more BBQ to flavor them. Everything else was amazing and was some of the best BBQ we had. 

They also take your order fairly quickly and I love that they have it hot and ready. It is so much nicer than waiting!

My only complaint was the young lady who took my order. She did not seem happy to be working and was very rude to us because we had a larger order. Other than that, we were very happy with everything!"}

The moist brisket was the best brisket that I have ever had. It just melts in your mouth and the crispy burnt ends are so flavorful with just the right amount of smoke and rub. The rudy's sauce compliments the meat perfectly. I love how the regular sauce is spicy and the mild sauce is "Sissy". BBQ sauce should have a nice kick to it. the potato salad tastes like good homemade potato salad. Nothing crazy cause it don't need to be when it's good. I couldn't leave without buying some of their sauce and dry rub to try on a pork butt this weekend. i will be coming back to Rudy's for another round soon. It's legit BBQ!"}

The chips served after you are seated are accompanied by 3 salsas (green chili citrus, hot verde and "regular") and all three are really tasty.

If you like beef then try the Durango burrito. My wife always goes for the enchilada trio (chicken, avacado). You get to select from sides like rice, papas (mashed cheese potatoes with chilis), and various beans. The margarita list is solid, and the house ritas are really pretty good. There's a great lunch menu if you're visiting midday. 

The staff has mostly been friendly and attentive every time we've visited- the place is good for kids as they have  nice menu for the little ones. The "main room" has a skyscape painted on the ceiling, so our toddler enjoyed that room. For the quality of food, I think the price is right- although expect to pay a little more than Macayos or Serranos. It's worth it, go visit!"}

While it was a bit crowded, they were easily able to accommodate our party and allowed us to be seated in the private room. The atmosphere was essentially a knock off of some places I have been in Texas, as was the food. 

On entering the line passes by 2 big tubs filled with ice and beer and pop. The assortment of beers that are mostly from Texas was very interesting to find. The cold salads are in a fridge to your left, but with no signage telling you that you have to pick one up there if you wish to eat on the premises.

Next was the main counter. For those who have never eaten Texas style BBQ, you order by the partial or full pound and it is placed on butcher paper on your tray (or in this case crate). I ordered an assortment of meats including the moist brisket, sausage, ribs, and prime rib. I also got the cole slaw, creamed corn, and for dessert, peach cobbler. I opted to skip the bottled drinks and buy a cup to fill at the soda dispenser which is a lot cheaper.

Upon finding my seat, I found there were two sauces for those who prefer their meat that way, along with some hot sauce. There is also a condiment bar where you can get your silverware(plastic) as well as jalapeno's and packets of everything from mustard to horseradish sauce.

The brisket was extremely moist and easily cut with plastic implements. I felt is could have used a bit more seasoning as it usually is in Texas. Next I sampled the sausage. I felt it could have used more spice in it, and ended up having to put mustard on it to be able to eat it comfortably. Unfortunately, the ribs were very tough, and after a number of tries to bite through them I finally abandoned them to the trash can. Last of the meats was the prime rib. A very nice piece of almost medium rare beef, lightly smoked. While the beef was very nice, once again the lack of seasoning caused me to downgrade the experience.

The coleslaw was nothing special, as it was chopped in a buffalo chopper, but my money is on the creamed corn. What a winner! The brisket with the creamed corn could have easily been my entire meal. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a quart of the creamed corn to bring home it was that good.

Last was the peach cobbler. The cup I was given was almost all pastry, with just a little peach sauce on it. Nowhere did I ever get a bite of a peach. This was a total waste of money.

Other members of our group ordered the potato filled with pulled pork. The portion was very large, but once again, the meat was lacking in flavor. 

On the negative side, about 7:30 the place filled with smoke so bad that our eyes were watering. Apparently, they put out the fire pits at that time, and the lack of ventilation makes it a real problem. 

BBQ is not a cheap meal. While what I ordered was larger than the average person might order, it still was over $45. Quite a high amount for the quality of food that was received. 

It should also be noted that they serve breakfast tacos which are said to be quite good. In my next review of them.

2 Stars for uniqueness and cleanliness."}

I worried about long lines but that didn't happen at 5pm on a Tuesday.  I figured they had a month to get their staff working efficiently.  We were greeted at the door and given small printed menus as they explained that the meats were sold by the half pound, there were cold sides in a large refrigerator case, drinks on a huge ice filled table and an order counter.  They place your order in a wax paper lined plastic basket, approximately 12" by 18" with 5" sides.
We took a medium sized (pint) potato salad (3.69) and a small pudding (2.49) from the refrigerator case, and 2 bottles of IFC root beer (3.38) off the iced table and proceeded to the counter with the digital scale.  Ordered pulled pork and was charged for 0.58 lb of it at 5.79, don't know why they can't measure it out to the half pound listed at 4.99 they advertise. Also ordered beef brisket, the moist which is a bit more fatty but I heard the extra lean was too dry. They put over 3/4 of a pound on the scale and the girl asked if I wanted some taken off, which she did leaving 0.69 lb (8.96) The meats were great, moist, delicious, well smoked, some of the best BBQ we've had. Also ordered some hot sides, new potatoes small 1.99 (boiled or steamed peeled potatoes, chunked and floating in butter.  Nothing special, little flavor, needed lots of salt and pepper, won't order it again.  Sweet cream corn small 2.19 was overly sweet, needed lots of salt to counteract the sugar, won't order again.  The potato salad was fairly good, I'd order that again as it goes well with the meats.  My wife said the pudding (banana) was "kinda bland and I wouldn't order it again".  Total with tax was $31.00
A bit overpriced I think,  They threw in 8 slices of white and wheat bread to make sandwiches with, the bread was very fresh.  There were 2 kinds of BBQ sauce on the table, tomato/vinegar based, on mild, one slightly spicy, they were OK, not great. You could buy a 32 0z bottle for 8.50 if you desired.  Other than the quality and taste of the meats, nothing else stood out.  There are long wooden tables that could become uncomfortably crowded if they are very busy.  I think I might return to buy their meat and take it home, the brisket at 12.98 a lb and the pulled pork at 9.98 a lb.  I give them 4 stars because of how good the meats are. There were pickles, peppers and sweet onion slices available for the taking."}

We had a very friendly waiter but unfortunately you could see because he had our large party of 7 to attend and another table of 12 or more he could've used a few more hands. Our drink order took a smidge longer than it should have but we can deal with that, as far as the food goes.. tonight they ran out of the warmers to keep the tortillas hot, which seems unusual being you have a full kitchen in back? Not only that I ordered the cilantro lime rice as my side with meal and not just once but twice did they bring it to me almost completely cold or semi warm a 30 sec microwave bake. It was so disgusting that I couldn't bare to even ask for it a third time to be correct. The waiter did have the manager come over after he had already informed her the 1st time that the rice was cold but the 2nd time she just gave the fake is there a different side option I can offer you I feel she was the worst at the customer service at least the waiter genuinely cared when they brought the food out cold twice. She couldn't care less. It's unfortunate you had a staff member going to his supervisor for help and back up on a super busy night for something going wrong in the kitchen and she as the manager handled it wrong, I see this as poor upper management and sometimes the managers need to be evaluated under pressure situations because it's unfair when the waiter does try to correct the situation but your superior does nothing to help you."}

I was starving (what else is new?) on a Friday night so I dragged my boyfriend out for some Mexican fare.  Let's start at the door: the hostess didn't look too excited to greet or seat us.  Our server took our drink order, we received our trusty chips and salsa, and got to work.  

The menu was pretty standard for an "upscale" Mexican restaurant, seafood selection and all.  After the server described "The Monterrey" plate as one you could fit a turkey on, I was convinced.  This hefty entree consists of four different types of enchiladas, a chile cheese relleno, chicken taco, and guac... how could we possibly go wrong?

The plate arrived ginormous, as promised; I just wasn't particularly impressed by any of it.  As much as I love food, I am a quality over quantity kind of girl, and this entree was not cuttin' it.  I honestly can't point out anything in particular that I did not like about the plate, it just wasn't memorable, finger lickin' good, or (please insert cliche here).  

When dessert was offered, we politely declined.  Our waiter dropped the check fleetingly and muttered a "Thank You" or something of that sort as he zipped past our table.  I do give the place props on decor, as the paintings, statues, and lighting throughout the restaurant are impressive and reminiscent of the culture of Mexico."}

That being said, I did get the same thing both times and am pretty sure I can say I enjoy their Pulled Pork portion and would get it again.  It is moist, soft, and flavorful all on its own, but I do enjoy drizzling some Sissy sauce on it.  I've also had their corn-on-the-cob twice and found it super plain and not even sweet or enjoyable.. totally blah for me with the corn.  They use real butter, though, so if I liked their corn, I'd be a fan of that.  I'll stick to the pulled pork.

On to their BBQ sauce: I am not a big fan of a few things, mainly how they serve the sauce, which is in a large diameter *glass* bottle with a bottle pourer (the kind bartenders used to control the flow of alcohol when pouring)... no bueno. It took me a long while to get a quarter size sauce on to my pork and it was just frustrating.. and the glass makes it non-squeezable.. and the huge bottle makes it heavy to hold while you're waiting for gravity to help you get that little dab of sauce out and on to your meat... yeahhh, it was that annoying.  Here's an idea: make your sauce fresh and then put it in big ass jars than we can either portion out ourselves (like Joe's Real BBQ) or put it in squeezable bottles (like Famous Dave's)... *anything* but giant glass bottles with pourer restrictors on... puhleeeeze!

Their staff is very friendly, the ambiance is very relaxed and totally casual, pic-nic-style seating and, of course, country.  They have a great concept of huge coolers of booze (beer) where you can pick out your beer and put it in a bucket.. they also have sody-pop and sweet tea.  

Country music on the speakers.... yummy pulled pork... buckets of cold beer... pic-nic seating.. that's what I enjoyed."}

I was more excited when I saw the real, shared-table, waxed-paper barbecue joint ambiance and the tubs full of iced beer.   An hour later (half of that standing in line), I came away empty of excitement and wallet, and only marginally more full of belly.  

Why, you might ask?  Because I've ruined barbecue in my own back yard that tasted better than the what they passed off as BBQ last night at Rudy's.   The meat was tender, to be sure, but there was more smoke in my clothes when I left than there was in the pork ribs or sausage we got.   If anybody's mother used to broil ribs in the oven when they were kids, well...that's pretty much what you'll get here, except it would be as if she accidentally spilled the entire pepper grinder on them first, because the meat rub at Rudy's consisted of an overpowering application of black pepper, and pretty much nothing else. 

I didn't get any of the brisket, but it looked delicious, so before I left I asked the guys at the next table how theirs was.  One of them said "it's good, it tastes just like corned beef, and I love corned beef".   Now -- HOLD THE DANG PHONE!  The fact that this guy likened his brisket to corned beef, which IS brisket, but peppered instead of smoked, should tell you all you need to know about how weak this joint is when it comes to producing actual barbecue.  It should not be possible to confuse barbecued beef brisket with corned beef, but if there's no smoke in the brisket, I suppose that's what you get.  And if there's no smoke in it, my friends, then it isn't barbecue.  

I was so perplexed by it all, I actually called their management the next day, told them of my experience, and asked them if they thought they were having an off night or if virtually smokeless and over-peppered was just the way it was meant to be.  They confessed to no off night that they were aware of, and said everybody loves it, and they hope I come back.  Sorry guys and gals...not on your life. 

As they say in Texas, this place is "all hat and no talent."  I don't understand what the fuss is about.   Texans should know better than to call this stuff barbecue, and so should everybody who knows what real barbecue is."}

I was very embarrassed. First off, the atmosphere was nice. Very unique! Our service was great but there was not a lot of people there. The chips were good but the salsa tasted like they squirted Macayo's taco sauce into a bowl and called it fresh!( My guest came up with this comparison!)  

My guest had a steak fajita chimi plate that came with rice and beans. The presentation was gorgeous! The cheese sauce on top tasted like the canned Nacho cheese sauce you might get at a state fair. In fact...my guest said that was all he could taste! The refried beans were very bland. No lard for sure! The rice resembled a Chinese fried rice which was just weird!  He hated it so much that he didn't eat much. 

I had the steak Fajita's which were supposed to be marinated.(NOT)! It was over cooked(some spots were even burnt and crunchy) fatty cheap steak. My guess, Flank or Skirt steak! The veggies under it were not Mexican! They consisted of broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, a few peppers and a lot of onions. It was served with a bowl of pinto beans. They were soupy and tasted like liquid smoke! I didn't eat much of my dinner either! 

I have traveled many places and dined in many exquisite establishments. This in no way resembled Mexican or Spanish cuisine in any way.  Just gross and VERY over priced!

One of the best things about this place are the bbq smokers right behind the registers.  You can watch them pull out the meats and cut it right there.   Then they serve it by the 1/2lb. And will serve your BBQ on top of butcher paper.  No fancy plates or bells and whistles.  They know their BBQ will speak for itself. 

Seating is almost picnic style as there are just different picnic tables and chairs through out.

Went on a slow afternoon when the crowd had disappeared. I stepped to the counter and the little girl behind it basically took me to school on bbq and all of their sides. Before getting a chance to order she was plying me with spoonfuls of cream corn (amazing) and their vege chili  (out of this world). She had the slicers carve me pieces from their smoked turkey breast, two kinds of brisket, pulled pork, and smoked sausage. After swallowing I decided to take home a half pound of the lean brisket, some pulled pork, a couple of sausages, and a bunch of sides. Everything was great. The only knock I have is the bbq sauce is only so-so. Fortunately all of the meat was so succulent and well seasoned that the sauce became an afterthought.

Also, the meat is sold by the pound not by the plate, so you get exactly what you pay for."}

Good ol' Texas style BBQ. I can dig it. If you've never been to Rudy's, then damn boy, you're missing out. They have an assortment of beverages (and alcohol!) to choose from. 

Brisket and sides galore and pools of sauces. Pig out and enjoy yourself. This is the best BBQ West of the Mississippi. Hell, it may be better than most of the BBQ East of the Mississippi too."}

as i said in my review or cant stop smokin bbq I LOVE BBQ & couldnt wait 4 both these to open, but then the disappointment.
WHAT IS UP WITH THIS BY THE POUND ORDERING STYLE????
Ive never dealt with this b4 and Ive been all around the country! and all of the sudden 2 rest. within 300 ' of each other both do it??? oh well, about the food.
it smells great outside!
the layout is better than css bbq
I was urged to try samples, which is great
i got the turkey, and bought a hunk of cheese (???)
THEY ONLY HAVE 2 BBQ SAUCES & they arent even much different?!
coleslaw was really plain.
the "school lunch" type seating is dumb, i dont want to be forced to eat with strangers

Although the building itself is grandiose and looks like a palace with an interior courtyard, lots of artwork and such, the food and service weren't great.

To begin, I wasn't impressed with our server. He forgot a few requests and when I asked if I could try another side sauce for my enchilada he failed to mention the extra 50 cent charge. That's a major pet peeve of mine- failing to mention you're going to up charge someone for something is a big no no. When I told him, he offered to take it off, which I declined because that's not the point. You need to let people know in advance if you're going to do that. 

The food also just wasn't great. This was the most bland guacamole I think I've ever had in my life. The three table salsas and chips were ok. Not one of my three different kinds of enchiladas were flavorful and they all seemed to be smothered in cheese. The kids meal beef taco was extremely greasy. 

Overall wasn't a fan and don't need to return."}

At first I order half pound of each meat and try out which ones I love the best.

and now, I always come and order my Baby Back Ribs, Brisket (moist), Prime Rib, Sausage... Well Basically Everything.

Every order is at least 1/2 Lb.  Make sure you have a big appetite.
Love it when is just meat, no sauce (you add it yourself).  Other BBQ places I get sick of eating them because either too much sauce or too salty.  This is perfect!.

If you want sauce, they have the Rudy's Sissy Sauce and the regular Rudy's BBQ Sauce.

Side orders of Cole Slaw, Potato Salad are my FAVES!.....

Very casual place, eat it with your hands or with forks if you would like.... But I like the Man Cave way.

Me, not so much but I am not one to jump in the car because I am craving Mexican food. The food on this recent visit was tasty but the service was at best confusing. 

We were taken care of by 4 different people, our server who took the order and brought drinks (started out can I get you something to drink?, which sort of makes me crazy, offer me something specific or tell me your favorite), another that brought our food and I love this, this means they care about getting food out while still hot, so thank you! In the end we were brought our check by another server and when I handed back the bill to him it took a little while to finally get it back...from yet another server. I understand team work but usually it comes along with a little communication. Where did our first server go? No mention if he went on break or dropped into an abyss. 
I have never seen a manager in this restaurant, at least that I can remember. I happen to like when the manager stops by and says hi and asks how the staff is doing on our visit. 
I am sure I will be back because the ladies of the house are fans and I wont have to go kicking and screaming because food is usually good, I just will not expect to be "wow"ed by the staff."}

If you're brand new to Rudy's, let them know and they'll have someone come and explain the whole menu and how it works. They'll also let you sample the different meats before you purchase!

The atmosphere: It's very casual and friendly. They have huge metal containers with ice holding beers, sodas, and other fun drinks. (FYI, if you don't want the glass bottled sodas they do have regular cups and a self serve soda fountain.) Large picnic tables are placed in rows in the main dinning area as well as on their patios. Fun, vintage metal signs adorn the walls giving it a more country laid back kind of look. They also have flat screen TVs hanging around the dinning area to watch whatever game is on.

The Service: The first time we went everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The second time we were also greeted with smiles. The guy who took our order seemed a little grumpy but towards the end of our order he gave a big smile. I think he was just focusing on the order to make sure it was correct. Either way he didn't ruin our experience.

The Food: Both times the food has been delicious. The meat is tender and seasoned very well. I will say on our first visit my corn on the cob was over cooked but this last time I got the cream of corn and it was delicious!! And it is NOT like cream of corn from a can, do try there's, it's wonderful. The spicy chop and sausage is very tasty. My hubby loves the brisket! Next time I'm going to try their chicken. The new potatoes are great but if you get the butter on them they do put ALOT of butter, so maybe ask for them to go light on the butter. My hubby likes their potato salad, which is in the fridge near the front of the line, and he enjoys the corn as well. They only have two BBQ sauces to choose from, which are on all the tables, but both are tasty. One is  a little sweeter then the other and is always my choice. Know that when eating in the restaurant your meats will be placed on wax paper. At first I thought it was odd but after sitting down it just adds to their atmosphere and their meat is so tender that using the plastic forks and knives hasn't been an issue. As far as dessert I believe they have puddings and pies in the fridge but we've never had their desserts.

The ONLY bad thing I can honestly think of is the bread. They'll ask you if you want some bread to go with your meal for free but don't expect homemade rolls. It's actually sliced bread from a bag, just like what you buy at the grocery store. This is my reason for the 4 stars. They really should be baking their own rolls. The first time we did accept the bread not knowing but this last time we didn't bother with it.

Overall it's a great place for some yummy BBQ with a laid back atmosphere and the prices are well worth it."}

Really, unless it's completely disgusting, it's all the same to me.  Tortillas, rice, beans, cheese.  By food alone none of my Mexican reviews would vary more than 1/2 a star up or down.  Again, when I go to Mexico, now that's a different, very yummy story.
So I'm going to judge the restaurant.  It's actually cute.  It has a large, covered, internal patio.  Which unfortunately is always full, I gotta aks if they take reservations.  But the ambience is nice, and the staff is friendly.  I disagree with other posters that it's expensive...it's average, and really, you get huge portions.  Ok, so they have large portions at Filiberto's too, but here you pay for the service and the ambiance.  So I didn't think it was that pricey.  I also like that it can accommodate large parties...restaurants like these are always hard to find.  Where do you take the grandparents, greatgrandparents, grandchildren, parents....?  here.  I don't think it's the place for hip people to hang out, or maybe not great for a romantic date, but it is perfect to bring your grandparents on your birthday, or your dad on father's day.  Every place has its purpose."}

If you're a first timer they will give you samples.  We tried the brisket, the chopped brisket, pulled pork, turkey and hot sausage.   Yum.  

We ended up ordering lean brisket, turkey, pulled pork and a hot link.  The brisket was good when hot, but got pot roasty as it cooled down.  The chopped brisket - which we didn't order was pretty good and we might get that next time.   Hubby liked the hot link - for me the skin was too poppy.  Pulled pork was a little greasy - but tasty.  The big surprise was the turkey - excellent.

Side dishes were just so so - the cole slaw was ok - but the beans were blah.  

It was a little noisy and not the most comfortable place - long tables - metal folding chairs - friendly atmosphere.

We'll be going back!"}

It's a place I look forward to anytime.  When I saw they were building a location, I was incredibly excited.  

The place is clean (as expected on the first day of business).  I was greeted right away upon showing up.  They had a line at 11am, and I showed up around 2:30, the first time the line didn't extend outside.  They did a great job of making sure the tables were kept clean, etc.  Something that often seems overlooked when a place is packed/busy.

Being their first day open, I was expecting some delays and mistakes, but I think everything went smoothly considering many of the customers were new to the process as well as the employees.  I got what I ordered, quickly and efficiently.  I ordered a 1/2 lb of moist brisket (.53 lb to be exact), some "new potatoes" (red potatoes) and corn on the cob.  Had them throw some bread slices in.  They give you a great bottle crate to carry all the food.  It's better than a tray.  They can really pack it in there.  I got a large drink, as I plan to keep the cup and just bring it back for the $.75 refills.  They had fresh iced tea and everything was clean and organized.  I found a table and started eating.  I had just eaten at the Albuquerque location last weekend, but this was amazing.  Tasted as good as usual and I was impressed.  

I live in Central Phoenix and head out to the east valley once or twice a week.  I usually always head to Joe's in Gilbert, and will continue to do so occasionally even though I don't think it's as good (Rudy's brisket is better and they have corn on the cob and red potatoes - two things I wish Joe's had) or as consistent.  Given the choice, I'll pick Rudy's, though.  Our other local places don't hold a candle to Rudy's.

They all seem to run about the same price.  I was out of there for $13.98, which is about $1 more than Joes, but you get more food - just enough in fact.

It's a bit of a drive for me, but it's worth it.  I'll just have to make more excuses to be in the area.  I was very surprised to see that someone is opening a BBQ place directly across the street.  I admire the entrepreneurial spirit in this economy, but I'm afraid that they won't stand a chance with a Rudy's around."}

I had a beergarita to start, YUM! Nice and big. They also serve chips and salsa to start so that was cool too.

I had the chicken and enchilada plate with rice and the cheesey potatoes. This food is pretty Americanized which is fine by me since I am not a huge fan of this fare normally. The enchilada was so so in my mind but the taco was really good. I had the ground beef taco. The rice was typical rice but good and the cheesey potatoes were amazing (how cnayou go wrong with cheese and potatoes creamed to a nice puree?!)

Boyfriend got a HUGE platter of tacos and enchiladas and rice and beans and potatoes. I MEAN HUGE! It all tasted good and he's a huge critic since this is his favorite kind of food. He admitted his was Americanized as well but you can't complain if something tastes good right?

His mom was with us and she got the tilapia dish. It looked really healthy and smelled really good. Fresh veggie mix as the side with some rice and shrimp on top of the fish.

Overall I think this place was good. We had a gift card here so that was our excuse for going there. I don't know if we would ever go again since we don't live in the area but I am not ruling it out."}

My family and I weent early for Mother's Day dinner and I saw a shift in service and food quality.  On the plus side, the the Dip Sampler appetizer was one of the best I had.  But the service was very slow even when our waitress went down to 3 tables.  My wife's drink, ordered when we sat down, took 20 minutes to arrive.  She had a special request for the drink and it was ignored.  I had the Beef & Cheese Chimichanga.  It was VERY BAD.  The ground beef was either old or spoiled and it tasted sour.  I took two bites and stopped.  The waitress looked at me and said, "You don't like it?  Still deciding, huh?"  and then walked away.  She came back 15 minutes later and I kindly requested that it be taken off the bill.  She said a manager would come by the table, but he or she never did.  The charge was taken off the bill.  My wife's entree - the Juarez - and my daughter's Child's Beef Taco were fine.  My son's Fajita Tacos looked liked they were literally thrown together with no attempt at presentation.  When my family was finished eating their entrees, the waitress said she would bring the check and didn't ask us if we would like dessert or anything else.  Some may chalk off  my bad experience to it being Mother's Day, but if  restaurant can't give good service and great food when busy, why would you want to go there in the first place?"}

The brisket being a particular favorite, closely followed by the pulled pork, and they apparently serve breakfast now, so I'll have to stop in for brisket breakfast tacos sometime soon.

We did enjoy the red cream soda at Rudy's & their take home cups. Ironically, the cups at Dickey's are also take home & Joe's serves red cream soda too.

My parents are in love with Abeulos because they're from Connecticut and when they think Mexican food, they think enchiladas as it's all they know.

The place is pricey for what you get.  $15-20 for a couple mediocre, small enchiladas.  I won't ever be going here on my own.  When I go with them I order the cheapest thing on the menu.
  
Of note is something strange.  Abuelos has three salsas that come with chips when you sit down.  One is ok, and the other two are terrible.  They are very, very bad.  Here in Arizona, I can find the best salsas I have ever had.  But not at Abuelos.  Just everywhere else.  One is green and very sweet.

They are so close to our house my husband and I stop by every once in a while and have not been disappointed with the food (even though I do still prefer Andrew's). My favorite is the lean brisket with their spicy bbq sauce. I really wish they had cornbread but their baby potatoes make a pretty good side dish.

Last summer my hubby's nephew held his graduation dinner here. I was wishing that he would have chosen someplace a little nicer but it actually worked out great because everyone could order what they wanted without fights over the check at the end of the night. The manager reserved the private room for us even though we were only a group of about 25 so we could have easily sat in the main restaurant. But it was nice to have the privacy. They even let us bring in an ice cream cake and kept it in the freezer for us until after the meal. Everyone who works here is pretty friendly but the service that night was above and beyond so I had to give them 4 stars for that."}

Their chips and salsa were fantastic.  Their green salsa is out of this world.  It's a really good thing I really liked the chips and salsa and was able to chow down, because dinner...

The Bad - Two things
One - I ran into something at Abuelo's that I've run into at a Chili's and I've learned a couple other chains are starting to do...Applebee's is the one I recall a friend mentioning.  There was a digital screen on our table!  At my Chili's experience, I learned that one thing they do with these screens is make available the specialty menus - vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan, kosher, etc.  Ok, fine.  I didn't ask Emily to pull up a veggie menu on the screen because, frankly, I wanted nothing to do with it!  The first thing we did was put our screen face down on the table.  It was impossible not to see the screens on other tables as they flashed through quizzes, games, information about the restaurant's history, etc.  I can only guess that Abuelo's is trying to get families to all interact with the screen so people all don't all pull out their cell phones while waiting for their food to come out...I HOPE that's their goal, anyway.  The presence of these things just depressed and sickened me.  Do Americans really need this sort of stimulation?  What has happened to the art of dinner conversation and coming together to talk about our days?  Abuelo's, why are you adding in more digitainment to distract those of us actively trying to - for example - teach our children that dinner-time is a time to put AWAY the electronics in order to enjoy one another's company?  Ugh!  Yuck!  Why?


Two - As a vegetarian, I'm used to ending up with black beans and some other rice substituted for the usual rice.  I'm not used to the beans being so salty they can't be eaten.  I also think they would have been better trying for maybe a little salad instead of their "specialty cilantro rice".  It was literally white rice cooked with cilantro and I think that was IT.  No seasonings to speak of.  Bland, bland, bland!  I got the avocado and the spinach enchiladas per the server's suggestion.  They were in some sort of crepe wrapping and tasty enough, but honestly...for the price it seemed like they should have doubled the number of enchiladas.  It really wasn't much food once you factor in the rice and beans I couldn't get myself to eat.  (I brought them home to have someone else taste test just to make sure I wasn't being too picky...sorry Abuelo's...it wasn't me!)

Abuelo's was a HUGE disappointment.  Thankfully, I had great company?  Truly, I can see the potential of this place.  It could have fantastic.  They claim to be old-fashioned Mexican food and the presence of lard in the refried beans and the use of chicken stock in the rice backs that claim up!  They've got a HUGE menu.  I think that if a bit more thought were put into vegetarian options and those darn screens went away, my review of this place would improve dramatically.  The whole feel of the place would be different!


Last note about those screens - apparently they can be used to pay for one's bill.  As someone who's lived in Silicon Valley and hung out with many, many, a computer expert...when it comes time to pay your bill, please RUN from these wireless terminals.  Keep your credit card info safe.  Have the restaurant run your card the old-fashioned way!"}

We love the loaded potato filled with Brisket!  Soooooo good, but get the sour cream on the side (butter, too, if that's your thing) to keep the wonderful smoked beef flavor from being overwhelmed.  Also worthy of your taste buds is the Green Chili Stew.

Even when there are a lot of people in line, service is still fast, since they move so quickly.  We love Rudy's!"}

I'd choose Abuelo's before all the other places. Why? Simply because for a chain establishment, the food offered is quite good, and the prices comparable. 

I tend to go for the seafood choices of Abuelo's I've had the Pescado Guerrero and the Enchiladas de Cozumel. Both entrees are good, the Pescado Guerrero is a mahi-mahi steak with fresh shrimp,
scallops, mushrooms, spinach, roasted peppers and sliced
avocado in a delicious white wine sauce. It's delicious, the mahi-mahi isn't fishy at all, and the accompaniment of the roasted peppers with the sliced avocado balances the dish. As for the Enchiladas de Cozumel, it is crepes filled with fresh guacamole, covered
in a rich white wine sauce with a medley of perfectly seasoned
shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, fresh spinach and roasted peppers, the dish is similar to the Pescado Guerrero hence why I like both. 

Another plus for Abuelo's are its tortilla chips and salsa. The tortilla are so crisp that they're quite addictive, and the salsa is not overtly spicy, and has a thick consistency. Something that I do enjoy. So, if you have a hankering for some Mexican, I suggest you try Abuelo's if there's a location near you, it's worth it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"}

Rudy's has always been my favorite for their brisket and creamed corn. They also offer Texas beers (Shiner) so you can channel your inner-Texan.

They start you with samples which is good. I went with my safe bet, brisket and pulled pork. They have a dry tough lean brisket and a moist fatty brisket. The mounts was my choice. It's just ok. Really not great. Some brisket you eat with no sauce it's so darn good. Not here. Gotta soak it in for flavor.  The pulled pork is pre-seasoned and really wet. Paying for the wet here on the weight for sure. Had to soak that in sauce too. Now, the sauce is good, darn good too or I'd be stuck. So overall great place, 3 stars or less on the food."}

Right off the bat let me state that I come here to eat meat - period. I couldn't really care less about the sides, although their chocolate pudding is top notch. Rudy's brisket is the best I've ever eaten. Let that sink in ... the best I've ever eaten. Their smoked turkey is life-changing, it's so good. I usually order two meat selections and one of them is usually a hot link. So it's lean brisket and a hot link or pulled pork and a hot link, you get the idea. They have two types of BBQ "sause", spicy and the kind my wife likes (sissy sause). Both are good, although I'm partial to the spicy stuff. The dining area is clean, family-style seating at long tables with folding chairs or patio tables on the semi-enclosed "patio". There's lots of TVs showing sporting events and C&W music on the speakers (I can't stand C&W, but I'll tolerate it to eat this food). Back to the food - my wife likes their green chili stew and their peach cobbler. The stew is good, but I'm not a cobbler kind of guy. Their breakfast tacos are also really good and inexpensive. We have been eating here for years, and I eat lunch here 2-3 times a month as I work nearby. We have never had a bad experience at Rudy's. If you're thinking about going to the place across the street - don't. Just go to Rudy's. You can thank me later."}

If you live anywhere near I-10, you've probably seen that eyesore of a red barn that is Rudy's BBQ.  It's a dining experience unlike any other in the Valley.  It's like a delicatessen, crossed with a picnic, and covered in BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is really good, but I learned a few things that will make my experience even better next time.

Tip #1:  Show up early for lunch.  It's not as packed as when it first opened, but we waited about 10 minutes to order at 11:45.  Wait until 12:15 and you'll have a long line and trouble finding seats.

Tip #2:  Understand what you're getting.  You can order sandwiches, but most people order meat by the pound.  The sign says $6.49 for a half pound of brisket, but you pay what it weighs.  My portion was over $7.  I wouldn't recommend the "cutter's choice" option.  I saved some pocket change, but my brisket didn't look as moist or as lean as my friends'.

Tip #3:  Order pint sides and share them among your friends.  It's better value.

They serve the food in what looks to be a wax paper lined milk carton.  After navigating the condiment bar (try the cherry peppers), you can look for a small wooden picnic table, or take up part of a large table covered with red and white table cloths.

As for the food itself, the brisket had a great smokey flavor, but it was dry in places, and had large hunks of fat.  I blame myself for ordering "cutter's choice."  Rookie mistake.  The cole slaw was really good.  The cabbage was minced pretty fine, and it was sweet and creamy, but not too creamy.  The new potatoes were just roasted potatoes in butter.  They definitely needed salt, and the inch of melted butter in the bottom of the styrofoarm bowl was an unappetizing visual.  There were two bbq sauces on the table.  I liked the tangy, vinegary flavor.  One was supposed to be spicier than the other, but they tasted similar to me.  Both had kick.

I have some friends in Austin, TX that think Rudy's rivals Salt Lick BBQ, and I think they're crazy.  It's good, but it's not that good.  The smokey flavor of the brisket definitely stood out, though.  I'm looking forward to my next visit, when I can navigate the menu a little easier."}

Ordered a brisket sandwich. The beef was so dry it was inedible. I had no time to return it. I am not the BBQ eater where I use a lot of sauce as it then covers up the fakir of the meat. Doing so would be Ike why even bother taking the time to slow smoke the meat in the first place. I actually choked on this it was like leather. It alone was way over salted for my taste. 

Even if I was able to return this meat it should never made it to my plate like that. That plate is a signature dish and should never be prepared and served like this in my opinion. 

Great atmospheric and comfortable environment. Wish there was a manager on duty that asked me how the food was. Just a bunch of kids last Saturday at 5PM. 

If I could I would have given this 0 stars as my sandwich and coleslaw and water was over $10 and was near inedible. 

Lots of BBQ choices one right next door!

The meat is good too. I was not a fan of the moist brisket. But the lean brisket, turkey and something else that involved brisket was good. Would def go back."}

Fresh cut white meat turkey on a bun--rye bread would be better but to keep the cost down, they only offer something close to a hamburger bun. .l also had the small potato salad and a diet coke. 

For those who are dining here the first time--the ordering line is long during peak hours. No plates and every item ordered arrives in a tray. Once you get your tray, turn right to the soda machine and condiments. Everything needed can be found here. 

As far a "Real Texas BBQ", don't expect that here due to the low prices. It is what it is!"}

Now, I am not a huge BBQ fan, it's just never been my favorite, however, Rudy's was pretty delicious. 

The menu is simply placed on the wall with quite a few options, but not too many to make your decision impossible. You're able to try a sample before you order it if you would like as well. 

The pulled-pork sandwich I ordered was cooked to perfection and paired with some really buttery and delicious mashed potatoes ( btw, I am a mashed potato fiend). 

The staff is friendly and upbeat and their service is quite speedy. 

Rudy's would be  a five star for me if it weren't for the picnic benches. I am all for theming your restaurant, however picnic benches are, and always will be, my idea of a bad time. They aren't comfortable and it's also weird because they're connected, like in a cafeteria. If I wanted to sit next to random people, I would go to a sushi bar or something of the sort. I just wanted to sit with my friends and enjoy my meal without the person next to me honing in on my conversations. 

All together, though, I do think I will return to Rudy's for some fine pulled-pork."}

So a little info. Everything is a la carte and sold by weight. I ordered 1/4 pound of the moist brisket and the original sausage. We got sides of potato salad and coleslaw. Oh, almost forgot, banana pudding. They place everything into a cool crate and it's open seating. They also had bar with other sides including pickles, tomato peppers, jalapeños, etc. Two tasty sauces are on the tables. One a little more spicy and one more vinegary. Both tasty. I prefer the Sissy sauce (more vinegary). 

Everything was tasty. Including the sides. Potato salad was great. I'm addicted to the cherry peppers. We will definitely be back. Great place to take big groups and friends."}

The location is kind of in an awkward spot. It's on the north side of Chandler Rd just east of the i10. Rudys is frustrating. I enjoy cooking BBQ and mine isn't nearly as good. I love that they let you try all the different meats. I generally go with 1/2lb Prime Rib or 1/2 moist brisket. Both are awesome. You pay by the pound so the majority of the time they overshoot the weight, which is fine. Rudys offers two different sauces, I prefer their normal sauce to the sassy sauce. So here's my only knock on Rudys, their sides are kind of weak. I've tried a majority of them and I just don't think any are up to the standard in which they make the BBQ.

1. Had to move booths because the first booth and seats were so spread apart we had to literally sit at the edge of  our seats to reach the table.
2. Decor/ style was over indulgent for a Mexican restaurant and reminded me of a cheap version of the Venetian hotel in Vegas. Very tacky.
3. If you are looking for a cool, hip restaurant this isn't it. 
4. Margarita was good but gone after just a few drinks.  For $10 I expected a bit more grande than what I got.
5. Jalapeño fritters were the best thing I ate. They we're served warm. Asked server if I could get hot ones and he replied somewhat annoyed and confused " do you want me to throw them back in the fryer?"  Enough said there. (The manager did return with hot ones and did not charge us for the item.)
6. Yes, they have 3 types of salsa....and that's about it.  The green one is just plain offensive. Not sure how that one found its way into a so called authentic Mexican restaurant. It was also very challenging to scoop out salsa from the small tin bowls when they come about a 1/4 full.
7. Ordered fajitas. Let's see...flavorless and waaaay overlooked. Just plain bad! 
Not sure what people like so much about this food. I'd rather go to Chipotle."}

I came here with a friend recently for dinner. They have a huge menu, and, not being familiar with their food, decided to play it safe with a chicken burro (also, it was less expensive).

It was literally just a flat, super (or should I say souper) saucy burrito with a splash of lettuce on the side. It seriously lacked flavor, and wasn't worth the price.

Not much of it in Phoenix AZ; a lot of Sonoran Style which really doesn't ring my bell.  Abuelo's is as close to what I grew up with that I've found in the Valley.  The quintessential Tex-Mex plate is cheese enchiladas with chili gravy, crunchy beef tacos, and tamale with rice and beans.  They hit the mark right-on with the enchilada and taco, but the tamale is so-so.  Chips are outstanding and the salsa is very good.  The place is a little too fancy and the prices are a bit high, but you won't walk away hungry."}

Food - So I had two enchiladas...chicken with a queso sauce and a spinach and mushroom with a cream sauce. Both were deliciously spicy (because their sauces were on point!). For my sides, I chose the spinach casserole and their mashed potatoes. The sides were a delicious change of pace to the rice and beans that I usually get. My counterpart enjoyed the fajitas and the cervezarita, and the only thing he would have changed would have been more peppers with the fajitas (as it was mostly onion). 

Service - The service we received was prompt and attentive. 

Atmosphere - Dim lighting with a cool vibe and jovial feel."}

They stated this was one of their favorite tex-mex places. Upon arriving I was a little put off by the expansive building, columns and statue, but my group sat in the bar area, which was comfortable. 
Our server was excellent! Yummy chips and salsas were served right away. While looking over the menu, looking for vegan options, we thought we had options figured out, but asked and were mistaken. The server knew the ingredients of many of the vegetarian options and was able to let us know which had hidden animal fluids. She customized some items for us and everything was delicious. 
The happy hour specials were great! My party enjoyed many margaritas and two orders of guac. 
I would go back, because the family would want to. My only request is a few more vegan options, thanks!"}

So we get to the restaurant and the ambiance and décor remind me of a dim Cheesecake Factory - restaurant was open, nice, and chain-like. We get seated and we order the sangria. Sangria was good and strong - my kind of drink!  Then we get the complimentary chips and salsa - eh, ok.

My bf and I order the Monterrey.  It was a big plate enough for two people: Sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole. 

We started chowing down and every bite I took tasted like the last - no matter which part of the plate I was eating. The food was bland and lacked flavor.  I was so disappointed!  Luckily, my sangria was kicking in, so my disappointment did not ruin my happy mood.

The check came and for the two of us, we spent close to $50."}

The decor at Abuelo's for some reason reminds me of a Vegas casino. A little over the top. Kind of cheesey but still fun and nice it its own way. Service has always been good. If I remember right they have a decent bar, too.

This is not on my regular rotation but I am willing to go here if someone else invites me.  For more authentic Mexican you can try Espo's down the street but you will not get the same level of service or ambiance."}

Unlike our last visit, the hostress did sat us on a comfortable booth away from the kitchen without asking. Shortly after chips and salsa was served, the waiter showed up lightening fast and gave us the ice tea that we ordered right away. For appetizer, we ordered small shrimp ceviche for less than $5. Even thought the portion was small, it was a good size to fill me up before our parties arrived. It has a bit too much tomatoes in it which makes it tardy...overall, I still enjoyed it. For my main entree, I ordered fajitas for 1 with all beef (you can choose two different types of meat if you like chicken, shrimps or veggie) and double size of Spanish rice. The meat portion was very generous, but it was a little on the dry side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it after mixing it with salsa to make up for the dryness. 

We told the waiter that it was our friend's birthday. When we were done with our entrees, he gave us a plate of chips with scoops of ice-cream on each one of them. It was quite delicious. After we paid the bills, he still stopped by to give us refill for drinks and did not ignore us like the last waiter did. I'm extremely impressed with the improvement that they've made since my last visit."}

My honey and I, in a moment of Mexican food desperation, stopped by Abuelo's because we've heard good things. 

People lie.

The chips were thin, which I normally like, but they were so thin they couldn't support the salsa. The salsa left much to be desired. While flavorful, the taste was surprising. And not in a good way. (Kind of like when you order a Coke™ in the drive-thru and end up with Dr. Pepper™ instead.)

The margaritas were deceivingly generous. I filled my glass three times, but the alcohol content was very low. Were it not for the calories, I could have had five or six of them and still cleared a breathalyzer.

As for the actual meal, I don't know where to begin. I have had better Mexican food frozen from a box than I was served at Abuelos. The sauce tasted heavy of preservatives and more like something you'd get from a can. The pork and the beef on both of our dishes was chewy, and too, more like something you'd get from a can. Honestly, the whole meal was just ick.

The only possible redeeming aspect of the meal could have been dessert, but, alas, they don't serve your traditional Mexican desserts. Fried ice cream is not to be found anywhere on the menu. Of course, fried ice cream doesn't come in a can, so.. there ya have it.

I would avoid this restaurant. If you're in the mood for Mexican and are in the area, see some of my other reviews."}

We warned them that the last time my Husband, Son and I had been there, the food and service was not quite what it used to be. Well, we should have listened to ourselves. The last time we thought they must have just had a bad night and so tonight was going to be better. Boy were we wrong. The Hostess seated us quickly and courteously, no worries, right? My Husband ordered the drinks for us ( 3 Ice Teas & a Coke), while I went to the Restroom to wash my hands. I always make it a habbit to look in the stalls even when I wash my hands. The Toilets had  paper in them and the seats were in need of cleaning. But okay. I thought about telling the manager, but did not want to cause any issues. 

When I returned to the table, the chips and salsa had been placed. (Chips are very thin and the Salsa is very runny). Trying to put Salsa on the Chip is not easy and you have to hold your hand under because it will drip on your shirt otherwise, trust me. 
There was no plates provided to keep one clean. 
After about 5 minutes Chip our server brought the Drinks and went off somewhere. About 10 minutes later he returned to take our order. When I asked about the Salsa he said that this is how it is brought in, so I assume they don't make it fresh on the premises. Big minus, because it is not that expensive to make yourself and there are a lot of good recipes out there. One of the Red Sauces tasted really weird, the other one was good, but like I said to runny. The Green one, kind of tasted like their was Pineapple Juice in it? Strange. 
We ordered the Guacamole Appetizer so that we could eat the Chips and the Guacamole was really good. 
The food arrived. We had ordered 2 Beef Fajitas, one for my Dad and one for my Mom. My Husband and I decided to split the Ribeye & Enchiladas. We opted for the Cheese Enchiladas. The Beef Fajita Meat was extremely chewey. My Parents could not eat it. We had ordered our Ribeye Medium and it was very well done, my Husband who used a Steak Knife had a hard time cutting thru it. Did I mention how really thin the Ribeye was? 
We were looking for our Waiter Chip who was nowhere to be found. About 10 minutes later we got the Busboy to get us the Manager. She came out and asked what the problem was and I told her about the meat. She said sorry, but it immediately followed with an explanation on how they cook the Fajita Meat and when I showed her our "medium" Ribeye she went on to tell me how they now have a new supplier. 
Now, having been in the Food Business myself for over 31 years, I do know that the supplier does not do the cooking and that really was not what I wanted to hear. She did ask if we wanted the food to be redone and my parents and us asked for the Meat to be remade. 
It took 20 minutes for the remade meat to come out. By that time, my Mom had finished the sides that came with her fajitas and we had eaten the underwhelming cheese enchiladas and the some of the drippy Beans (more landed on my shirt, it was this runny) and my Dad really didn't want to eat the sides because he was just so upset about all of this. 
Anyways, the Meat is brought out, the manager wanted to know if she should take my Dad's sides and I said, may as well, because they were cold now, to which she replied that she asked me if I wanted the sides redone as well. 
I admit, I did not ask her to that at the time, but what upset me was her tone of voice when she asked me. 
My parents went ahead and ate the Meat, because they were really hungry, even so it was still a bit on the chewy side. Not sure what kind of Meat they use, but it is a tough one. We had driven over 300 miles today and were starving. 
My husband could not finish the Ribeye, because it was still not that easy to cut thru the fat on the still very thin steak. I ate my half, because I was also just hungry.

At the end of the Meal, Chip and the Manager both tried to upsell us on Desert. Are you kidding me? After the mediocre Meal we just had? We really did not want to take any chances and have to pay for a bad desert as well. 
I would have appreciated a small discount, maybe the drinks off? But we ended up having to pay for the full meal, even so the quality and service was severely lacking tonight.

I wrote a comment on their website, don't know if they will care enough to respond. This just left us totally flabbergasted as how bad they have become. Used to be our favorite Mexican Restaurant, guess now we will have to go find a new one."}

Also ordered their Mucho Margarita, and that one was spot on. Will probably go here next time for happy hour and see what they offer. Service was borderline rude. I was with my parents that time, so I assumed I might whip up my ID just in case, and the server said " I dont need the ID, it's okay". Then I asked jokingly "why do I not look you ng anymore?!" (im 24 lol) and she said "no not anymore" with a couple of hahas. Gee, thankssss. But yeah anyway, minus that little situation, ambiance is pretty with fake coconut trees and cloud ceiling. Oh and btw, that skinny girl that's hostessing, don't put her there, she looked annoyed as hell on her job, not a very good start for the customers. But yeah, still Aok. Would go back for the drinks more so."}

My fiancée and I decided to celebrate Mexican Independence Day with our first visit to our nearby Abuelo's.


The Plot:
We started by sharing the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and Seared Tuna appetizers.

That was followed by The Monterey, which consisted of a Sour Cream Chicken Enchilada, Avocado Enchilada, Spinach Enchilada, Chicken Ranchera Enchilada, Cheese Chile Relleno, and a Crispy Chicken Taco.
We also ordered one of their September specials called The Hidalgo, which consisted of a Fajita Frite Relleno and Fajita Enchilada with Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans substituted for Mexican Rice and Refried Beans, respectively.

We concluded our meal by happily sharing a Chocolate Eruption.


The Scene:
We arrived at approximately 6pm on a busy and popular Saturday yet were seated within 15 minutes, which, in our experience, was quicker than average for a large franchise.

The chips with assorted salsa along with our beverages arrived soon thereafter.

The appetizers were the next pleasant surprise and both were enough for the two of us to share.
I was quite satisfied with the Seared Tuna despite it being somewhat more pricy compared to the other appetizers on the menu. We're both devoted fans of sushi and sashimi and the quality of the tuna, both in flavor and texture, was obviously better than we've experienced at most Asian restaurants. The mango relish, avocado, spicy mustard, and honey lime dressing complimented the fish very nicely.
The Stuffed Mushrooms were topped with a cheese sauce that was light and had a nice tomato flavor that went well with the spinach.

The Monterey was a generous quantity of food for the price and would have been enough for the both of us on its own. This was my first time trying a Spinach Enchilada and Avocado Enchilada and both were very good. I am also a Chile Relleno fan and I truly enjoyed the fresh, veggie flavor of the one that was served with assortment.

My fiancée thoroughly enjoyed her Relleno as well, which on the Hidalgo plate was stuffed with beef, and the Fajita Enchilada was stuffed with chicken. Both were flavorful, well seasoned, and she commented favorably on the delicate texture of the corn tortilla.
She was also very satisfied with the Cilantro Lime Rice and Black Beans, which nicely dressed up this plate more than the Mexican Rice and Refried Beans probably would have.

The Chocolate Eruption was a slight variation on the familiar molten chocolate cake or chocolate lava cake with which we've all been tempted before. We both liked this version very much because the hot chocolate sauce was poured on top rather than baked inside so the whole the cake was soft and moist. There was also enough ice cream and whipped cream for both of us to share. As restaurant franchises go, this was perhaps the best dessert experience we've had thus far this year.


The Rest of the Story:
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices very reasonable for this type of dining.

This was our first experience using Ziosk and I hope many more of our favorite restaurants will begin to implement this system. Be sure to tap the "Call Server" button when you're ready to order.


Epilogue:
We felt the quality of the food and the overall dining experienced deserved 3 stars and decided to upgrade our rating to 4 stars based on the good service, reasonable prices, and the chocolate dessert.

No doubt we will return the next time we're in the mood for Mexican.

My kids got the cheese enchilada and bean & cheese burrito; they ate it so fast I barley got a picture. My husband & I ordered the Monterey... SOOOO good. Only thing I didn't like was the chicken taco, might switch that for a beef one next time. But the chile rellenos was by far the best part of my dish!! The chips are good, the salsa comes in small dishes and only one salsa is really that good. Will definitely be back for the food and atmosphere!!"}

I will start with the positives. delicious food, great decor, friendly servers, tasty drinks, quick service, yadda yadda yadda.

My only complaint would be the hostesses. They were both polite enough with the "Welcome to abuelos" "thanks for coming" but paired with the least enthusiastic manner. They lacked personality. The girls both looked like they were not thrilled to be there. 

If the hostesses made me feel like they were glad to have me then I would've given the restaurant five stars! I would recommend eating here. Hostesses will not ruin your meal."}

However we have been coming here for some time so I thought I should write something.  

Service

First, never had bad service...never...That's difficult to pull off.  Yes it is a chain, but you really wouldn't know it.  

Today, we had an exceptionally great server Emily (don't know if that's how she spells it).  But she answered all of our questions and actually had opinions on what she liked and why.  

Food
Yes, the food here can be sporadic.  But it is never bad.  It is not always consistent. For example, sometimes you get a lot of chicken in your enchilada and sometimes you have to hunt for it.  

Today, as usual we both had enchilada combos.  Don't judge, we like them.  Wife and I tried two new enchiladas.  

I had the spinach enchilada.  I will be getting them again...and probably again.  Wife had the avocado enchilada.  We both liked the spinach (yes we shared) and she liked the avocado.  I hated it.  But I hate guacamole so it made sense I wouldn't like it. 

Wife also tried the pork enchiladas.  I think she liked them because I never saw one of them. 

If you like cheesy mashed potatoes and don't care about calories and fat because you are eating out, then you would be remiss not to enjoy their greatness.  

And of course...charro beans please. 

Summary
We like it here, warm friendly atmosphere.  They wait to make fun of you until you leave when you put a greedy amount of mints located at the front desk in your bag."}

This is my favorite restaurant of all time. I can't believe that I just found out about Abuelo's in November 2012. But I can tell you that I go there on a weekly basis to get my avocado enchiladas, papas and beans. Plus the chips and salsa are to die for. If you like hot ask the waiter or waitress to bring you the inferno sauce, it is the best but only available upon request. I have tried many other items on the menu and they are all awesome. My husband's favorite is the stuffed chicken medallions but he is always trying new specials and they never disappoint. If you have not tried Abuelo's you are missing out on some incredible food."}

Then the chips are scrumptious with the three salsas....loved the chipotle fire roasted tomato - perfect kick of heat! Then the fajitas were so good I didn't want to stop eating!

We have visited the Abuelo's near Arrowhead Center many times. It usually is quite busy any day of the week, but expect long waits an Friday and Saturdays. The chips and salsa they serve are best of all with  thin,crispy chips and 3 kinds of salsa. My wife and I will usually order the "skinny" margaritas which have less sweetness than the regular margaritas. I have tried multiple entrees and have never been disappointed. I especially like the tilapia. Service is usually quick, even on busy nights. Food is of good quality, prepared well, and nicely plated. Prices may be a little higher than other Mexican restaurants, but well worth it for the food and ambiance."}

I even asked the manager if they changed the recipe and he said no. It used to be filled with wonderful ingredients and now it looks like they opened a bag of pre-cut lettuce and dumped it on a plate with hardly any other veggies.  I also enjoyed the salsa they used to serve a while ago.  Now they have 3 different salsas brought out and none of them match the quality of the original salsa."}

The chips are paper thin.  The fajitas aren't really seasoned and come with tons of onions and not enough peppers.  Tiny plate of toppings.  On the bright side my friend and I recently split an order of these bland fajitas with extra chicken, which was plenty of food and just a few bucks more for the extra chicken.  

We've been here before, so on our way out we were kind of looking around for the yummy buttermints that are normally sitting out in a bowl.  Upon request, we were each given a handful from a huge box hidden behind the host stand.   Why weren't they out - the hostesses didn't want to share??  

The courtyard feel to the restaurant is nice but the food isn't worth it.  And the happy hour ends at six o' clock; lame."}

Picture this: shopping in Caesar's Palace with recessed fluorescent lighting trimming a domed ceiling, Dia De Los Muertos and Latin artistic touches in the plentiful paintings (including a pairs shot of Frida Kahlo and Alejandro Gómez Arias), many well-appointed nooks for dining with relative separation from the din, and hints of rural Spanish cathedrals.

Only a verbose description properly corrals the elements of this experience - a feast for the eyes. That is only matched by the feast found on their menu. I position my rating by saying that the food is slightly more traditional, with less focus on fusion combos and more on the individual flavors of key ingredients. I recommend the layered dip, with seasoned ground beef, melted queso, guac, sour cream and peppers. A lovely starter that is easily shared by two. And the complementary salsa is above average, with a well-thought-out single serving bowl per person.

The Green Chile Stew (while John, our server, raved about it) was ok. I love spice; however, the black pepper overpowered the green chiles. The beef was tender but sinewy at points; and the potatoes seemed an afterthought, having not fully absorbed the flavor of the sauce. I wanted to try the Cilantro Lime (chicken with pozole), but it was not available on that visit.

Also, the Espinaca Casserole had some great spinach but only one piece of mushroom and no noticeable peppers, as promised on the menu. Oddly, it included corn, which was not mentioned. Won't venture there again.

My dinner companion had the "linebacker's meal," as she called it (saving the leftovers for her hubby). It was the well-priced $14.95 Monterrey, with sour cream chicken enchilada, avocado enchilada, spinach enchilada, chicken ranchera enchilada, cheese chile relleno, crispy chicken taco and guacamole. The plate was scorching and the selection was amazing; something worth testing with a friend. She said it was all good but not terribly memorable.

Highlight of the trip was the service. I would have likely come back to try other selections, like some of the seafood dishes and margaritas; still, the hospitality, the attentiveness, the genuine listening skills and the efficiency will definitely make this a repeat venue.

So, be sure to sample a sampler and take a leisurely walk around the restaurant to acquaint yourself with the art, statues and murals. Tell Frida, I said "hi.""}

First off, this is highly gringified Mexican food, mellowed out for the more sensitive gringo palates of suburban Chandler (right up professor's alley, as he's from Indiana). If you want the real thing, go to Guadalupe, or better yet, South Tucson. That said, the food wasn't bad at all, in fact, it was quite good. Frozen margaritas packed a punch, and the place is quite charming, with lots of hanging potted plants and colorful murals. Service was prompt and polite. Whether its totally worthy of being a self-proclaimed embassy of cuisine is in doubt, but Abuelo's is definitely reasonable, given the price."}

I ordered the layered dip and a carafe of Sangria. I personally feasted on chips, salsa and dip which were wonderful. My cuzzo and the wife ordered fajitas and a chicken chimi .They also consumed two pitchers of margaritas which is probably why they enjoyed the food so much. Any who,  I actually had a bite of the chimi and the fajitas and it was ok-nothing mouth watering or succulent here. It was average. All in all this a pretty cool environment for chips, salsa and a drink. Will I return? Absolutely, and I will have chips, salsa, a pitcher of margarita and a carafe of Sangria with the girls..."}

We were visiting from LA and tried this place and so liked it that we came the next night too. Chips and salsa which they serve free is really good. We ordered Fajitas for two. It comes with your selection of two sides for each person. Try their special sites which is marked on the menu. We ordered steak and chicken it was also very good. Must try place."}

Just asked...How many?...and sat us down. When we left there were two of the hostesses at the entrance, neither of them said a word as we walked out the door!. Service was a little spotty, and the waiter could have been more attentive, and simply put the check on the table without asking if we wanted desert, which we did! The food was better then average, good flavors! But could have come to the table a little hoter then what it was. Management really needs to do some in house training on the staff!"}

There is one in Myrtle Beach we go to when we are in that area as well. Since I was back in AZ had to go to Abuelo's and grab some lunch. Ended up there at the odd time of too late for lunch, too early for dinner so they were not very busy. Our server, wish I remembered his name, was EXCELLENT. He brought us the normal salsa, then offered the habanero salsa.... gave great recommendations on dishes to order and when decided he had great suggestions on how to "customize" them. BF had the taco and enchilada plate, beef crunchy taco and chicken enchilada with the spinach cheesy thing and the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are excellent, the spinach cheesy thing excellent.. mix the two and it is beyond yum. Beef was well seasoned and chicken nice and tender. I opted for the 2 enchilada plate with one chicken one shredded beef. Server recommended the velveeta cheese on the beef which I opted for but ended up scraping off.. the flavor of the "cheese" overwhelmed the beef. The beef was nice and tender, well seasoned and the chicken was the same. I had the cilantro rice and black beans. The black beans were well seasoned and delish, I could have eaten a huuuuuuuuge bowl."}

Has it really 4 years since I wrote Abuelo's off as disappointingly bland? I have to remedy that. Along the way, they've found their footing again. On top of that, there have been several menu changes for the better. Whether you want mild or a kick in the mouth, they've got you covered. The menu's expanded to the point it even includes some less-common dishes you'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. 

And oh my God, you guys, the carnitas, oh my God. They originally introduced it as a weekend special--basic carnitas tacos--and it's since colonized a half-dozen entrees. EAT IT.

Service has been impeccable without fail."}

We politely said hello and asked for a booth, she looked at us like we were from Mars, and didn't say a word.  Whispered something to another girl, who sat us, without a word.

The only reason this restaurant is getting 1 star, is because of the delicious cheesecake dessert and cup of coffee, awesome! Also, the ambiance is fantastic, fabulous idea with the cloud ceiling.

Our server, Brittany, was rude, impatient, short, and the least bit helpful.  The only reason I know her name is because I heard her greet another table next to ours.  She didn't check on us more than once, the very polite busser lady took better care of us!  

The food was NOT traditional, completely chainy, heavy, and full of oil.  I guess i'm just spoiled with good Mexican food from where I live...

The salsa tasted, (and looked), like tomato paste.  The chips were light and delicious though.  

Basically, there is a reason the other Abuelo's have closed."}

I am curious--people who give this a bad rating--what place do you find better for Mexican?  Macayos???  Carolinas?  Both are disgusting compared to Abuelos.  would love to know what places these people find to be good--odds are they are horrible places.

Get the grande.  It is the best Mexican dinner in Arizona.  but be hungry!"}

The dip trio was tasty. My pineapple infused margarita was great, too bad it's just barely a splash over ice for $8.25. My fajitas were yummy, I was pleased to find a variety of veggies (not just standard onions/green peppers) on my skillet. The portion was just right, enough for 3 tortillas w/no leftovers. Our server was nice/attentive but didn't not hover or ask questions when our mouths were full. 

The interior reminds me of a Vegas type of "courtyard"  restaurant enclosed in a hotel. Weird. Anyway, we'll definitely be back."}

The first thing that I like about Abuelos is that it doesn't look like your typical Mexican Restaurant. I hate it when they over exaggerate the Mexican theme. Abuelos does it right with a courtyard feel ambiance. 

The food is amazing. They have one of the best beef fajitas I have ever tasted. They also have various flavors of enchiladas that are very good.

Depending on time of day, you will experience a wait time to get a table which means there will be a wait time for your food. Don't worry, they provide chips and salsa and they are good. The food is definitely worth the wait."}
